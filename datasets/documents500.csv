In 2005, 96% of population of the municipality were ethnic Bosniaks. History. The ""župa"" of Gradačac was first mentioned in 1302, while the town's first written mention dates from 1465 (also as ""Gračac""). The town became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1512, its ""nahija"" (municipality) was first recorded in the defter of 1533, while its ""kadiluk"" (county) was recorded in 1634. In 1701 the settlement was given the status of a ""palanka"" (city), and it became the headquarters of a military captaincy in 1710. The captains of the Gradaščević family led the development of the city, and the most famous of them, Husein-kapetan Gradaščević or ""Zmaj od Bosne"" (""Dragon of Bosnia""), led an uprising that raised to arms most of the Bosnian captains in 1831. The town has a fort with 18-meter high walls built between 1765 and 1821, and a 22-meter high watchtower, built in 1824 by Husein-kapetan Gradaščević on foundations made originally by the Romans. Husejnija Mosque was built in 1826. It was severely bombed during the Bosnian war 1992–1995. It is located at the narrow northern corridor that connects two major portions of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska, near Brčko. Gradačac became part of the Tuzla Canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war. Thermal springs. The first spa facility, Ilidža Spa Treatment Centre was built on the thermal springs in Gradačac in 1882. The water temperature is 29.30˚C. In the area nearby are also two lakes Hazna and Vidara. Economy. The most important industries in Gradačac are textile, chemical, mechanical and food processing. Gradačac is the place where the traditional international fair for plums is held. Education. In the municipality there are 2 high schools, 7 elementary and 14 regional schools. "
wikipedia-1303632," Sapporo Brewery  The company has five breweries in Japan as well as the Sleeman brewery in Canada. The main brands are ""Sapporo Draft"" (""Premium"" in North America); ""Yebisu""; and ""Sleeman Cream Ale"". History. The origins of this company are in Sapporo, Hokkaido during the Meiji period, where the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitakushi) established many businesses. Seibei Nakagawa, a German-trained brewer, became the first brewmaster of the Kaitakushi Brewery in June 1876, and the first Sapporo Lager was produced at that time. Privatized in 1886, the Sapporo brewery became the centerpiece for the Sapporo Beer Company. In 1887, another company, the Japan Beer Brewery Company was established in Mita, Meguro, Tokyo, and began producing Yebisu Beer. The competition between Sapporo and Japan Beer, as well as competition with the Osaka (now Asahi) and Kirin breweries led to a 1906 merger of Sapporo, Japan, and Osaka breweries into the Dai-Nippon Beer Company, Ltd., which formed a near monopoly on the Japanese market until after World War II. After 1949, Dai-Nippon was split into Nippon and Asahi breweries, with the Nippon Breweries resuming production of Sapporo beer in 1956 and renaming itself to the present name, Sapporo Breweries, in 1964. Yebisu Beer was relaunched as a separate brand in 1971, marketed as a German-style barley beer. Sapporo Black Label beer was launched in 1977. In 2006, Sapporo announced they would be acquiring No. 3 Canadian brewer Sleeman in a $400-million all-cash deal. On February 15, 2007, Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund, a Cayman Islands-registered fund management subsidiary of Warren Lichtenstein's Steel Partners and the biggest shareholder (18.6% as of Feb. 2007) of Sapporo Holdings, submitted a proposal to the company seeking approval to raise its stake to 66.6%. Despite its name, ""Sapporo beer"" is not exclusively brewed in Sapporo. Sapporo is also brewed in Sendai, Chiba, Shizuoka, and Kyushu. Most Sapporo sold in North America is brewed at the Sleeman brewery in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Breweries. Japan. Sapporo has five breweries in Japan. The first, Sendai Brewery, was opened in 1971 in Natori, Miyagi, and was among the first to use a computerised brewing system. Shizuoka Brewery in Yaizu was opened in 1980, Chiba Brewery in Chiba was opened in 1988, Hokkaido Brewery in Eniwa, Hokkaidō was built in 1989, and the Kyushu Hita Brewery was opened in Hita, Ōita in 2000. Canada. Sleeman Brewery was purchased by Sapporo Brewery in 2006 for $400 million. Sleeman was restarted in 1988 in Guelph, Ontario, Canada by the great grandson of John H. Sleeman, the owner of the original Sleeman brewery founded in 1834. The first Sleeman brewery ceased operations by 1933, when their liquor license was revoked for bootlegging, specifically, smuggling beer into Detroit, Michigan. The company's current products are based on the family's original recipes, and Unibroue original recipes. Brands. The company produces a range of pale and dark lagers, including ""Sapporo Draft"" (""Premium"" in North America) and ""Yebisu"". In the Sleeman brewery in Canada they brew Sleeman branded beers such as ""Sleeman Cream Ale"", as well as ""Sapporo Premium"". The company also produce a malt based soft drink, ""Super Clear"", which was launched in 2002 as a low-alcohol beer, then changed in September 2009 to an alcohol free malt drink. Yebisu. ""Yebisu"" comes in two main varieties: ""Yebisu (Premium)"", a Dortmunder/export lager and ""Yebisu Black"", a Euro dark lager. There are also occasional special varieties that are limited in distribution area and time. As of April 2007, there is a green-label ""The Hop"" variety. The modern-day ""Yebisu"" is positioned as Sapporo's ""luxury"" beer label - Sapporo describes it as a beer brand with ""a touch of class."" It is a 100% malt beer. ""Yebisu"" is notable in that its Japanese name includes the now-obsolete we kana (character) (ヱ or ゑ), an anachronism (historical kana usage). This can lead to confusion when romanized, as the ""Y"" is not pronounced. The Tokyo neighborhood of Ebisu was named for the beer, which was originally produced there, though the we kana was later dropped. The pronunciations of both ""Yebisu"" and ""Ebisu"" are the same. In the anime and manga franchise ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", character Misato Katsuragi drinks ""Yebisu Premium"". Space Barley. Using barley grown from seeds which spent five months on board the International Space Station in 2006, Sapporo created a limited Space Barley brew. The project was a joint one between the Russian Academy of Sciences, Okayama University, and Sapporo. Tasters described the flavor as no different from similar beers, which researchers point to as important in showing that producing food in space for long duration flights is possible. Six packs of the space beer were sold in a lottery system at a price of 10,000 yen. "
wikipedia-1303647," Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee  Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (Chinese: 狄公案; pinyin: dí gōng àn, lit. ""Cases of Judge Dee"", also known as Di Gong An or Dee Goong An) is an 18th-century Chinese detective novel by an anonymous author. It is loosely based on the stories of Di Renjie (or Ti Jen-chieh ), a magistrate and statesman of the Tang court, who lived roughly 630–700. The original Chinese novel contains cultural elements from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) rather than Tang Dynasty China, which may have been done deliberately. The book features nine drawings, three copies from old Chinese art, and six illustrations by the author.  After Robert van Gulik came across it in a second-hand book store in Tokyo, he translated the novel into English and used it as the basis to create his own original Judge Dee stories over the next 20 years.  In the English translation, Van Gulik wrote that: The English copy was first privately printed on behalf of Van Gulik by the Toppan Printing Company of Tokyo in a limited run of 1200 numbered signed copies. Plot introduction. There are three cases in this book. The first might be called ""The Double Murder at Dawn"". The case describes the hazardous life of the traveling silk merchant and the murder which is committed to gain wealth. The second is ""The Strange Corpse"" which takes place in a small village, a crime of passion which proves hard to solve. The criminal is a very determined woman. The third case ""The Poisoned Bride"" contains the murder of the daughter of a local scholar who marries the son of the former administrator of the district. This case contains a surprising twist in its solution. All three cases are solved by Judge Dee, the district magistrate - Detective, prosecutor, judge, and jury all wrapped up into one person. Literary significance and criticism. """"Dee Goong An"" is the genuine article, dating from the 18th century and barely modified by the translator to make it intelligible today. Like his modern fictions, it adroitly intertwines three plots and shows the judge and his aides in their now familiar guise. The introduction and notes (including Chinese ideograms for the skeptical) are as entertaining as the tale, once the reader has become a Dee-votee."" "
wikipedia-1303657," Autoethnography  Autoethnography is a form of self-reflection and writing that explores the researcher's personal experience and connects this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings. It differs from ethnography —a qualitative research method in which a researcher uses participant observation and interviews in order to gain a deeper understanding of a group's culture— in that autoethnography focuses on the writer's subjective experience rather than, or in interaction with, the beliefs and practices of others. As a form of self-reflective writing, autoethnography is widely used in performance studies and English. Autoethnography as a qualitative research method. Definition. According to Maréchal (2010), “autoethnography is a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing” (p. 43). A well-known autoethnographer, Carolyn Ellis (2004) defines it as “research, writing, story, and method that connect the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political” (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term’s definition. For instance, in the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as ""insider ethnography,"" referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadays, however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) point out, “the meanings and applications of autoethnography have evolved in a manner that makes precise definition difficult” (p. 449). Epistemological/Theoretical ground. Autoethnography differs from ethnography, a social research method employed by anthropologists and sociologists, in that it embraces and foregrounds the researcher's subjectivity rather than attempting to limit it, as in empirical research. While ethnography tends to be understood as a qualitative method in the ‘social sciences’ that describes human social phenomena based on fieldwork, autoethnographers are themselves the primary participant/subject of the research in the process of writing personal stories and narratives. Autoethnography “as a form of ethnography,” Ellis (2004) writes, is “part ""auto"" or self and part ""ethno"" or culture” (p. 31) and “something different from both of them, greater than its parts” (p. 32). In other words, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) put it, “whether we call a work an ""autoethnography"" or an ""ethnography"" depends as much on the claims made by authors as anything else” (p. 449). In embracing personal thoughts, feelings, stories, and observations as a way of understanding the social context they are studying, autoethnographers are also shedding light on their total interaction with that setting by making their every emotion and thought visible to the reader. This is much the opposite of theory-driven, hypothesis-testing research methods that are based on the positivist epistemology. In this sense, Ellingson and Ellis (2008) see autoethnography as a social constructionist project that rejects the deep-rooted binary oppositions between the researcher and the researched, objectivity and subjectivity, process and product, self and others, art and science, and the personal and the political (pp. 450–459). Autoethnographers, therefore, tend to reject the concept of social research as an objective and neutral knowledge produced by scientific methods, which can be characterized and achieved by detachment of the researcher from the researched. Autoethnography, in this regard, is a critical “response to the alienating effects on both researchers and audiences of impersonal, passionless, abstract claims of truth generated by such research practices and clothed in exclusionary scientific discourse” (Ellingson & Ellis, 2008, p. 450). Anthropologist Deborah Reed-Danahay (1997) also argues that autoethnography is a postmodernist construct: The concept of autoethnography…synthesizes both a postmodern ethnography, in which the realist conventions and objective observer position of standard ethnography have been called into question, and a postmodern autobiography, in which the notion of the coherent, individual self has been similarly called into question. The term has a double sense - referring either to the ethnography of one's own group or to autobiographical writing that has ethnographic interest. Thus, either a self- (auto-) ethnography or an autobiographical (auto-) ethnography can be signaled by “autoethnography.” (p. 2) Also, doing autoethnographic work, many researchers attempt to more fully realize the idea of reflexivity by which the researcher can be aware of his/her role in and relationship to the research. An autoethnography is a reflexive account of one's own experiences situated in culture.In other words, in addition to describing and looking critically at one's own experience, an autoethnography is also a cultural practice. For example, Stacy Holman Jones (2005), in ""(M)othering loss: Telling adoption stories, telling performativity"", talks about her own experiences with infertility and adoption as they are linked to cultural attitudes about transnational adoption, adoption, infertility, and how we talk about these issues at different moments in time. She does so in order to understand her own story but also to change some of the perceptions around these issues. Types, areas, and approaches of autoethnography. Since autoethnography is a broad and ambiguous “category that encompasses a wide array of practices” (Ellingson & Ellis, 2008, pp. 449–450), autoethnographies “vary in their emphasis on the writing and research process (""graphy""), culture (""ethnos""), and self (""auto"")” (Reed-Danahay, 1997, p. 2). According to Ellingson and Ellis (2008), autoethnographers recently began to make distinction between two types of autoethnography; one is analytic autoethnography and the other is evocative autoethnography. Analytic autoethnographers focus on developing theoretical explanations of broader social phenomena, whereas evocative autoethnographers focus on narrative presentations that open up conversations and evoke emotional responses. (p. 445) A special issue of the ""Journal of Contemporary Ethnography"" (Vol 35, Issue 4, August 2006)[http://jce.sagepub.com/content/35/4] contains several articles on the diverse definitions and uses of autoethnography. An autoethnography can be analytical (see Leon Anderson), written in the style of a novel (see Carolyn Ellis's methodological novel ""The Ethnographic I""), performative (see the work of Norman K. Denzin, and the anthology ""The Ends of Performance"") and many things in between. Symbolic interactionists are particularly interested in this method, and examples of autoethnography can be found in a number of scholarly journals, such as ""Qualitative Inquiry,"" the ""Journal of the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interactionism,"" the ""Journal of Contemporary Ethnography,"" and the ""Journal of Humanistic Ethnography."" It is not considered ""mainstream"" as a method by most positivist or traditional ethnographers, yet this approach to qualitative inquiry is rapidly increasing in popularity, as can be seen by the large number of scholarly papers on autoethnography presented at annual conferences such as the International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry, and the Advances in Qualitative Methods conference sponsored by the International Institute of Qualitative Methodology. The spread of autoethnography into other fields is also growing, and a recent special issue of the journal ""Culture and Organization"" (Volume 13, Issue 3, Summer 2007) explores the idea of organizational autoethnography. Autoethnography in performance studies acknowledges the researcher and the audience as equally as important to the research. Portraying the performed 'self' through writing then becomes an aim to create an embodied experience for the researcher and the reader. This area acknowledges the inward and outward experience of ethnography in experiencing the subjectivity of the author. Audience members may experience the work of ethnography through reading/hearing/feeling (inward) and then have a reaction to it (outward), maybe by emotion. Ethnography and performance work together to invoke emotion in the reader. Higher education is also featuring more as the contextual backdrop for autoethnography probably due to the convenience of researching one’s own organisation (see Sambrook, Stewart, & Roberts, 2008; Doloriert & Sambrook, 2009, 2011). Such contributions explore the autoethnographer as a researcher/ teacher/ administrator doing scholarly work and/or as an employee working in Higher Education. Recent contributions include Humphreys’ (2005) exploration of career change, Pelias' (2003) performance narrative telling of the competing pressures faced by an early career academic and Sparkes’ (2007) heartfelt story of an academic manager during the stressful Research Assessment Exercise (2008). There are several contributions that are insightful for the student autoethnographer including Sambrook, et al. (2008) who explore power and emotion in the student-supervisor relationship, Doloriert and Sambrook (2009) who explore the ethics of the student 'auto'reveal, Rambo (2007) and her experiences with review boards, and finally Doloriert & Sambrook (2011) discussion on managing creativity and innovation within a PhD thesis. Another recent extension of autoethnographic method involves the use of collaborative approaches to writing, sharing, and analyzing personal stories of experience. This approach is also labeled ""collaborative autobiography"" (Allen-Collinson & Hockey, 2001; Lapadat, 2009), and has been used in teaching qualitative research methods to university students. Autoethnography is also used in film as a variant of the standard documentary film. It differs from the traditional documentary film, in that its subject is the filmmaker himself or herself. An autoethnography typically relates the life experiences and thoughts, views and beliefs of the filmmaker, and as such it is often considered to be rife with bias and image manipulation. Unlike other documentaries, autoethnographies do not usually make a claim of objectivity. An important text on autoethnography in filmmaking is Catherine Russell's ""Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video"" (Duke UP, 1999). For Autoethnographic artists, see also Jesse Cornplanter, Kimberly Dark, Peter Pitseolak, Ernest Spybuck. Autoethnographer as a storyteller/narrator. In different academic disciplines (particularly communication studies and performance studies), the term autoethnography itself is contested and is sometimes used interchangeably with or referred to as personal narrative or autobiography. Autoethnographic methods include journaling, looking at archival records - whether institutional or personal, interviewing one's own self, and using writing to generate a self-cultural understandings. Reporting an autoethnography might take the form of a traditional journal article or scholarly book, performed on the stage, or be seen in the popular press. Autoethnography can include direct (and participant) observation of daily behavior; unearthing of local beliefs and perception and recording of life history (e.g. kinship, education, etc.); and in-depth interviewing: “The analysis of data involves interpretation on the part of the researcher” (Hammersley in Genzuk). However, rather than a portrait of the Other (person, group, culture), the difference is that the researcher is constructing a portrait of the self. Autoethnography can also be “associated with narrative inquiry and autobiography” (Maréchal, 2010, p. 43) in that it foregrounds experience and story as a meaning making enterprise. Maréchal argues that “narrative inquiry can provoke identification, feelings, emotions, and dialogue” (p. 45). Furthermore, the increased focus on incorporating autoethnography and Narrative Inquiry into qualitative research indicates a growing concern for how the style of academic writing informs the types of claims made. As Laurel Richardson articulates ""I consider writing as a method of inquiry, a way of finding out about a topic...form and content are inseparable"" (2000, p. 923). For many researchers, experimenting with alternative forms of writing and reporting, including autoethnography, personal narrative, performative writing, layered accounts and writing stories, provides a way to create multiple layered accounts of a research study, creating not only the opportunity to create new and provocative claims but also the ability to do so in a compelling manner. Ellis (2004) says that autoethnographers advocate “the conventions of literary writing and expression” in that “autoethnographic forms feature concrete action, emotion, embodiment, self-consciousness, and introspection portrayed in dialogue, scenes, characterization, and plot” (p. xix). According to Bochner and Ellis (2006), an autoethnographer is “first and foremost a communicator and a storyteller.” In other words, autoethnography “depicts people struggling to overcome adversity” and shows “people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles” (p. 111). Therefore, according to them, autoethnography is “ethical practice” and “gifts” that has a caregiving function (p. 111). In essence autoethnography is a story that re-enacts an experience by which people find meaning and through that meaning are able to be okay with that experience. A prime example of autoethnography occurs when a family member or someone close to the family dies. In this painful experience people often wonder how they will go about living without this person and what it will be like. In this scenario, especially in religious homes, one often asks “Why God?” thinking that with an answer as to why the person died they can go about living. Others, wanting to be able to offer up an explanation to make the person feel better, generally say things such as “At least they are in a better place.” or “God wanted him/her home.”. People, who are never really left with an explanation as to why, generally fall back on the reason that “it was their time to go” and through this somewhat “explanation” find themselves able to move on and keep living life. Over time when looking back at the experience of someone close to you dying, one may find that through this hardship they became a stronger more independent person, or that they grew closer to other family members. With these realizations, the person has actually made sense of and has become fine with the tragic experience that occurred. And through this autoethnography is performed. Evaluating autoethnography. The main critique of autoethnography — and qualitative research in general — comes from the traditional social science methods that emphasize the objectivity of social research. In this critique, qualitative researchers are often called “journalists, or soft scientists,” and their work, including autoethnography, is “termed unscientific, or only exploratory, or entirely personal and full of bias” (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, p. 4). As Denzin and Lincoln (1994) argue, many quantitative researchers regard the materials produced by “the softer, interpretive methods” as “unreliable, impressionistic, and not objective” (p. 5). According to Maréchal (2010), the early criticism of autobiographical methods in anthropology was about “their validity on grounds of being unrepresentative and lacking objectivity” (p. 45). She also points out that evocative and emotional genres of autoethnography have been criticized by mostly analytic proponents for their “lack of ethnographic relevance as a result of being too personal.” As she writes, they are criticized “for being biased, navel-gazing, self-absorbed, or emotionally incontinent, and for hijacking traditional ethnographic purposes and scholarly contributions” (Maréchal, 2010, p. 45). Rethinking traditional criteria: based on criteria for evaluating qualitative research. In her book's tenth chapter, titled “Evaluating and Publishing Autoethnography” (pp. 252~255), Ellis (2004) discusses how to evaluate an autoethnographic project, based on other authors’ ideas about evaluating alternative modes of qualitative research. (See the special section in Qualitative Inquiry on ‘Assessing Alternative Modes of Qualitative and Ethnographic Research: How Do We Judge? Who Judges?) She presents several criteria for ‘good autoethnography’ mentioned by Bochner (2000), Clough (2000), Denzin (2000) and Richardson (2000), and indicates how these ideas resonate with each other.  First, Ellis mentions Laurel Richardson (2000, pp. 15–16) who described five factors she uses when reviewing personal narrative papers that includes analysis of both evaluative and constructive validity techniques. The criteria are: Autoethnographic manuscripts might include dramatic recall, unusual phrasing, and strong metaphors to invite the reader to ‘relive’ events with the author. These guidelines may provide a framework for directing investigators and reviewers alike. Further, Ellis suggests how Richardson’s criteria mesh with criteria mentioned by Bochner who describes what makes him understand and feel with a story. (Bochner, 2000, pp. 264~266) He looks for concrete details (similar to Richardson’s expression of lived experience), structurally complex narratives (Richardson’s aesthetic merit), author’s attempt to dig under the superficial to get to vulnerability and honesty (Richardson’s reflexivity), a standard of ethical self-consciousness (Richardson’s substantive contribution), and a moving story (Richardson’s impact) (Ellis, 2004, pp. 253~254). From “validity” to “truth”. As a research method that emerged from the tradition of social constructionism and interpretive paradigm, autoethnography challenges the traditional social scientific methodology that emphasizes the criteria for quality in social research developed in terms of validity. Carolyn Ellis writes, “In autoethnographic work, I look at validity in terms of what happens to readers as well as to research participants and researchers. To me, validity means that our work seeks verisimilitude; it evokes in readers a feeling that the experience described is lifelike, believable, and possible. You also can judge validity by whether it helps readers communicate with others different from themselves or offers a way to improve the lives of participants and readers- or even your own.” (Ellis, 2004, p. 124). In this sense, Ellis (2004) emphasizes the ‘narrative truth’ for autoethnographic writings. I believe you should try to construct the story as close to the experience as you can remember it, especially in the initial version. If you do, it will help you work through the meaning and purpose of the story. But it’s not so important that narratives represent lives accurately – only, as Art(Arthur Bochner) argues, ‘that narrators believe they are doing so’ (Bochner, 2002, p. 86). Art believes that we can judge one narrative interpretation of events against another, but we cannot measure a narrative against the events themselves because the meaning of the events comes clear only in their narrative expression. (p.126) Instead, Ellis suggests to judge (autoethnographic writings) on the usefulness of the story, (Bochner, 2001) rather than only on accuracy. (Ellis, 2004, p. 126) Art argues that the real questions is what narratives do, what consequences they have, to what uses they can be put. Narrative is the way we remember the past, turn life into language, and disclose to ourselves and others the truth of our experiences (Bochner, 2001). In moving from concern with the inner veridicality to outer pragmatics of evaluating stories, Plummer also looks at uses, functions, and roles of stories, and adds that they ‘need to have rhetorical power enhanced by aesthetic delight (Plummer, 2001, p. 401). Similarly, Laurel Richardson uses the metaphor of a crystal to deconstruct traditional validity (Richardson, 1997, p. 92). A crystal has an infinite number of shapes, dimensions and angels. It acts as a prism and changes shape, but still has structure. Another writer, Patti Lather, proposes counter-practices of authority that rupture validity as a ‘regime of truth’ (Lather, 1993, p .674) and lead to a critical political agenda (Olesen, 2000, p. 231). She mentions the four subtypes: ""ironic validity, concerning the problems of representation; paralogical validity, which honors differences and uncertainties; rhizomatic validity, which seeks out multiplicity; and voluptuous validity, which seeks out ethics through practices of engagement and self-reflexivity (Lather, 1993, pp. 685~686)"" (Ellis, 2004, pp. 124~125). From “generalizability” to “resonance”. With regard to the term of ‘generalizability’, Ellis (2004) points out that autoethnographic research seeks generalizability not just from the respondents but also from the readers. Ellis says, “I would argue that a story’s generalizability is always being tested – not in the traditional way through random samples of respondents, but by readers as they determine if a story speaks to them about their experience or about the lives of others they know. Readers provide theoretical validation by comparing their lives to ours, by thinking about how our lives are similar and different and the reasons why. Some stories inform readers about unfamiliar people or lives. We can ask, after Stake, ‘does the story have ‘naturalistic generalization’?’ meaning that it brings ‘felt’ news from one world to another and provides opportunities for the reader to have vicarious experience of the things told. (Stake, 1994) The focus of generalizability moves from respondents to readers.”(p.195) This generalizability through the resonance of readers’ lives and “lived experience”(Richardson, 1997) in autoethnographic work, intends to open up rather than close down conversation (Ellis, 2004, p. 22) Benefits/Concerns of autoethnography. Denzin’s important criterion is whether the work has the possibility to change the world and make it a better place. (Denzin, 2000, p. 256) This position fits with Clough, who argues that good autoethnographic writing should motivate cultural criticism. Autoethnographic writing should be closely aligned with theoretical reflection, says Clough, so that it can serve as a vehicle for thinking ‘new sociological subjects’ and forming ‘new parameters of the social.’ (Clough, 2000, p. 290) Though Richardson and Bochner are less overtly political than Denzin and Clough, they indicate that good personal narratives should contribute to positive social change and move us to action. (Bochner, 2000, p. 271) The benefits of autoethnography are the ways in which research of such a personal nature might give us insight into problems often overlooked in culture—issues such as the nature of identity, race, sexuality, child abuse, eating disorders, life in academia, and the like. In addition to helping the researcher make sense of his or her individual experience, autoethnographies are political in nature as they engage their readers in important political issues and often ask us to consider things, or do things differently. Chang (2008) argues that autoethnography offers a research method friendly to researchers and readers because autoethnographic texts are engaging and enable researchers to gain a cultural understanding of self in relation to others, on which cross-cultural coalition can be built between self and others. Also, autoethnography as a genre frees us to move beyond traditional methods of writing, promoting narrative and poetic forms, displays of artifacts, photographs, drawings, and live performances (Cons, p. 449). Denzin says authoethnography must be literary, present cultural and political issues, and articulate a politics of hope. The literary criteria he mentions are covered in what Richardson advocates: aesthetic value (Richardson, 2000, p. 15). Ellis elaborates her idea in autoethnography as good writing that through the plot, dramatic tension, coherence, and verisimilitude, the author shows rather than tells, develops characters and scenes fully, and paints vivid sensory experiences. While advocating autoethnography for its value, some researchers argue that there are also several concerns about autoethnography. Chang (2008) warns autoethnographers of pitfalls that they should avoid in doing autoethnography: ""(1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography"" (p. 54). Also some qualitative researchers have expressed their concerns about the worth and validity of autoethnography. Robert Krizek (2003) contributed a chapter of 'Ethnography as the Excavation of 'Personal Narrative' (pp. 141–152)to the book of ""Expressions of Ethnography"" in which he expresses concern about the possibility for autoethnography to devolve into narcissism. Krizek goes on to suggest that autoethnography, no matter how personal, should always connect to some larger element of life. Controversy of evaluating autoethnography. There are several flows of critiques with regard to evaluating autoethnographical works grounded in interpretive paradigm.  First, some researchers have criticized that within qualitative research there are those that dismiss anything but positivist notions of validity and reliability. (see Doloriert and Sambrook, 2011, pp. 593–595) For example, Schwandt (1996, p. 60) argues that some social researchers have “come to equate being rational in social science with being procedural and criteriological.” Building on quantitative foundations, Lincoln and Guba (1985) translate quantitative indicators into qualitative quality indicators, namely: credibility (parallels internal validity), transferability (parallels external validity), dependability(parallels reliability), and confirmability (parallels objectivity and seeks to critically examine whether the researcher has acted in good faith during the course of the research). Smith (1984) and Smith and Heshusius (1986) critique these qualitative translations and warn that the claim of compatibility (between qualitative and quantitative criteria) cannot be sustained and by making such claims researches are in effect closing down the conversation. Smith (1984, p. 390) points out that What is clear . . . is that the assumptions of interpretive inquiry are incompatible with the desire for foundational criteria. How we are to work out this problem, one way or another, would seem to merit serious attention. Secondly, some other researchers questions the need for specific criteria itself. Bochner (2000) and Clough (2000) both are concerned that too much emphasis on criteria will move us back to methodological policing and will takes us away from a focus on imagination, ethical issues in autographic work, and creating better ways of living. (Bochner, 2000a, p. 269) The autoethnographer internally judges its quality. Evidence is tacit,individualistic, and subjective (see Richardson, 2000; Holman Jones, 2005; Ellis & Bochner, 2003). Practice-based quality is based in the lived research experience itself rather than in its formal evidencing per se. Bochner (2000) says: Self-narratives . . . are not so much academic as they are existential, reflecting a desire to grasp or seize the possibilities of meaning, which is what gives life its imaginative and poetic qualities . . . a poetic social science does not beg the question of how to separate good narrativization from bad . . . the good ones help the reader or listener to understand and feel the phenomena under scrutiny. (p. 270) Finally, in addition to this anti-criteria stance of some researchers, some scholars have suggested that the criteria used to judge autoethnography should not necessarily be the same as traditional criteria used to judge other qualitative research investigations (Garratt & Hodkinson, 1999; Holt, 2003; Sparkes, 2000). They argue that autoethnography has been received with a significant degree of academic suspicion because it contravenes certain qualitative research traditions. The controversy surrounding autoethnography is in part related to the problematic exclusive use of the self to produce research (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994). This use of self as the only data source in autoethnography has been questioned (see, for example, Denzin & Lincoln, 1994; Sparkes, 2000). Accordingly, autoethnographies have been criticized for being too self-indulgent and narcissistic (Coffey, 1999). Sparkes (2000) suggested that autoethnography is at the boundaries of academic research because such accounts do not sit comfortably with traditional criteria used to judge qualitative inquiries(Holt, 2003, p. 19). Holt (2003) associates this problem with this problem as two crucial issues in 'the fourth moment of qualitative research' Denzin & Lincoln (2000) presented; the dual crises of representation and legitimation. The crisis of representation refers to the writing practices (i.e., how researchers write and represent the social world). Additionally, verification issues relating to methods and representation are (re)considered as problematic (Marcus & Fischer, 1986). The crisis of legitimation questions traditional criteria used for evaluating and interpreting qualitative research, involving a rethinking of terms such as validity, reliability, and objectivity (Holt, 2003, p. 19). Holt (2003) says: Much like the autoethnographic texts themselves, the boundaries of research and their maintenance are socially constructed (Sparkes, 2000). In justifying autoethnography as proper research, it should be noted that ethnographers have acted autobiographically before, but in the past they may not have been aware of doing so, and taken their genre for granted (Coffey, 1999). Autoethnographies may leave reviewers in a perilous position. [...] the reviewers were not sure if the account was proper research (because of the style of representation), and the verification criteria they wished to judge this research by appeared to be inappropriate. Whereas the use of autoethnographic methods may be increasing, knowledge of how to evaluate and provide feedback to improve such accounts appears to be lagging. As reviewers begin to develop ways in which to judge autoethnography, they must resist the temptation to ""seek universal foundational criteria lest one form of dogma simply replaces another"" (Sparkes, 2002b, p. 223). However, criteria for evaluating personal writing have barely begun to develop (DeVault, 1997). (p. 26) "

wikipedia-1303670," Wong Ka Kui  Wong Ka Kui, also known as Koma Wong (10 June 1962 – 30 June 1993) was a Hong Kong singer-songwriter. He was the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and the founder member of the Hong Kong rock band Beyond. He composed more than ninety percent of the songs for Beyond and wrote a few award-winning lyrics. While filming a gameshow for Fuji Television in Tokyo, Japan on June 24, 1993, Wong Ka Kui fell off a three-meter platform head first, and was hospitalized immediately. He died after spending several days in coma due to internal bleeding from head injuries. Biography. Early life. While a teenager, Wong Ka Kui was greatly interested in European and American music. At age 15, he bought an acoustic guitar and learned how to play by himself. From that moment on, he spent most of his time learning music on his own while still working other jobs. The formation of Beyond. In 1983, Wong Ka Kui met Yip Sai Wing, and formed a rock band called Beyond. Yip Sai Wing was the drummer of the band and Wong Ka Kui was the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. In the same year they won an award for ""Best Band"" in a competition sponsored by Guitar Magazine. Paul Wong, who initially designed posters and record covers for Beyond, joined the band later on as a guitarist. In 1984, Wong Ka Kui's younger brother, Wong Ka Keung joined the band as a bass player. Thereafter, Beyond remained an independent band, playing music at nightclubs and schools. In 1986, Beyond self-published ""Goodbye Ideals"" on cassette tape. Their early styles were mostly hard rock, new wave, post-punk, experimental and avant-garde. Leslie Chan, who later became their manager, attended one of their live performances and was impressed by their style. As a result, Chan invited Beyond to sign with Kinn's music. However, their hard rock style was not widely accepted by listeners in Hong Kong. Disappointing album sales presented Beyond with a dilemma. In 1987, Beyond released their first album, ""Arabian Dancing Girl"". Their music began softened with synthesizer, but their album sale still did not meet expectations. At the same time, they were constantly criticized by other rock bands about commercializing their original hard rock music. In 1988, Beyond released the album ""Modern Stage"" with some pop songs. For the first time, they included some slow-paced, love theme songs as well as songs with satirical lyrics about their Society. Again, their album sale was not successful, and their management company threatened that no more opportunities would be provided to them if they fail again. First success. Realizing the situation they were in, Beyond released their next album ""Secret Police"" with songs that were more within the popular genre. Songs such as ""The Land"" and ""Loving You"" from the recording ""Secret Police"" gained tremendous popularity, followed by Beyond's increased recognition and public appearances. After that, several of their compositions also proved to be incredibly successful. They received awards for ""Truly Love You"" and ""Social Party"".

In 1991, Beyond visited Kenya and witnessed the grinding poverty and misery there. Upon their return, a number of songs were written addressing the serious problems of Africa. The Beyond Third World Foundation was created in the same year with profits from the redistribution of an early album. Career in Japan. Realizing the restriction on original music in Hong Kong, Beyond decided to redirect their career to Japan. In January 1992, Beyond signed a worldwide management contract with Japanese record label Amuse. His stage name was ""Koma""; many fans still blaming this ""cursed"" name. During the year, they released an album called The Revolution Continues. In May 1993, Beyond returned to Hong Kong with a new album Rock and Roll. Wong Ka Kui's signature work ""Under a Vast Sky"", sometimes translated as ""Vast Sky and Boundless Sea"" won the Best Original Song award in Hong Kong.

wikipedia-1303679," Samuel Eto'o  Samuel Eto'o Fils (; born 10 March 1981) is a Cameroonian footballer who plays as a striker for English Premier League club Chelsea. Eto'o trained at Kadji Sports Academy. He also holds a Spanish passport, enabling him not to count among the ""foreign players"" working in the European Union. Eto'o scored over 100 goals in five seasons with Barcelona, and is also the record holder in number of appearances by an African player in La Liga. In 2010, he became the first player to win two European continental trebles following his back-to-back achievements with Barcelona and Inter Milan. He is the second player to have ever scored in two separate UEFA Champions League finals and the fourth player, after Marcel Desailly, Paulo Sousa, and Gerard Piqué, to have won the UEFA Champions League two years in a row with different teams. He is the most decorated African player of all time having won the African Player of the Year award a record four times: in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2010. As a member of the Cameroon national team, Eto'o was a part of the squad that won the 2000 Olympic tournament. He has also participated in three World Cups and six Africa Cup of Nations (being champion twice) and is the all-time leading scorer in the history of the Africa Cup of Nations, with 18 goals. He is also Cameroon's all-time leading scorer and third most capped player, with 55 goals from 112 caps. Club career. Real Madrid. Samuel Eto'o joined Real Madrid's youth academy in 1997, but he could only train with Real Madrid B, as he was still a minor. Real Madrid B were relegated to the third tier, Segunda División B, where non-European Union players are not allowed, and as a result, he was loaned to second-division CD Leganés for the 1997–98 season, when he was only in the tenth grade. After making 30 appearances for the club and only scoring four goals, he returned to Madrid following the end of the 1998–99 season. In January 1999, he was loaned out to RCD Espanyol, but failed to make any appearances for the club. Mallorca. The next season, in the winter transfer window, he transferred to La Liga team RCD Mallorca on loan, scoring six goals in 19 games. At the end of the season, Eto'o left Real Madrid, signing a permanent deal with RCD Mallorca for a club record £4.4 million fee. In his second season, he scored 11 goals and began to garner attention throughout the league. Mallorca President Mateo Alemany said of his style of play, ""I doubt if there is any other player in the world who would please the fans more at this moment."" Eto'o himself commented on his rise to stardom, ""I like it here in Mallorca; I have always been well looked after, the fans appreciate me and I also have a contract that runs until 2007."" He returned the fans' appreciation when he donated €30,000 in meals to travelling Mallorca supporters who made the journey to the Copa del Rey final against Recreativo de Huelva in 2003. Mallorca won the match 3–0, with Eto'o scoring two late goals to seal the victory. His volatile attitude, however, resulted in several off-pitch incidents. Bartolome Terrassa, a television journalist, filed a formal complaint after a run-in with Eto'o in the club's parking lot, accusing the player of saying, ""The next time, you are not going to escape; I'm going to kill you."" This was not the first incident, however, as the previous year, Eto'o's former agent, Daniel Argibeaut, accused the player of assaulting him with four accomplices, saying, ""They then took off my shoes, which in Cameroon means I am threatened with death.""  Barcelona. 2004–2007. Eto'o departed Mallorca as the club's all-time leading domestic league scorer (54 goals) when he signed for FC Barcelona in the summer of 2004 for a transfer fee of €24 million, after lengthy, three-way negotiations with Mallorca and Madrid. Initially, Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez wanted to buy back the full transfer rights and loan him out again, but eventually the Barcelona deal proved lucrative enough to warrant a sale. Additionally, the team already had its full quota of three non-EU players. Eto'o made his Barcelona debut in the season opener at Racing de Santander on 29 August 2004. After Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title, the team organized a festive party in the Camp Nou, during which Eto'o harangued the fans chanting, ""Madrid, cabrón, saluda al campeón"" (English: Madrid, bastards, salute the champions). The Royal Spanish Football Federation fined Eto'o €12,000 for his comments, for which he later apologized. He expressed regret and asked for forgiveness from Real Madrid, his first professional team. The head of the Real Madrid fan club federation remained unimpressed, however, stating, ""This character is a fantastic player, but he leaves a lot to be desired as a person."" He signed an improved contract with Barcelona in June 2005. After missing out on the previous year's Pichichi trophy, which is given to the topscorer in La Liga, Eto'o edged out Valencia CF striker David Villa for the award during the final matchday on 20 May 2006 when he scored his 26th goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao. Eto'o was very gracious to teammates after the game saying, ""It has been a team effort although only one person gets the award. We've worked hard all season and have got our just rewards."" Eto'o also contributed six goals during Barcelona's run to the 2005–06 Champions League title. In the final, Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off early on for bringing down Eto'o just outside of the penalty area, but the Catalans struggled to capitalize on their one-man advantage until Eto'o scored the game-tying goal in the second half. Barcelona went on to win the match 2–1, and Eto'o was awarded with the UEFA Best Forward of the Year award for his accomplishments in the European campaign. Eto'o also won an historic third consecutive African Player of the Year award that season. He said in his acceptance speech, ""Above all, I dedicate this to all the children of Africa."" He was also selected to his second straight FIFPro World XI and finished third in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year, making him only the second African footballer ever to be voted into the top three. The season started badly for Eto'o, as he ruptured the meniscus in his right knee during Barcelona's Champions League group stage match against Werder Bremen on 27 September 2006. Barcelona team physician Ricard Pruna originally estimated that the injury would keep him out of action for two to three months. After the operation, Eto'o's recovery time was extended to five months, but he resumed training with Barcelona in early January 2007. 2007–2009. Eto'o refused to come on as a substitute in a league match against Racing de Santander on 11 February 2007. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, ""He did not want to come on; I don't know why."" Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, ""These kind of things are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, if it is true that I am a problem for my team then I will go. But like I said, I am happy here. The press can write what they want."" Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho. After aggravating a meniscus injury on 28 August during a summer friendly against Inter Milan, Eto'o was sidelined indefinitely. On 17 October, in the midst of his recovery period, he gained Spanish citizenship. He was cleared to play again on 4 December, and returned to the side a week later in Barcelona's 2–1 league win over Deportivo de La Coruña. Eto'o recorded his first league hat-trick in a match against UD Levante on 24 February 2008. He finished with a total of 16 league goals in 18 appearances for the season. On 25 October, he recorded the fastest hat-trick in club history after netting three times in 23 minutes in a victory over UD Almería. Only two games later, on 8 November 2008, Eto'o scored four goals in the first half of Barcelona's game against Real Valladolid, which ended 6–0. On 29 November 2008, he scored his 111th career Barcelona goal in all competitions in a 3–0 road win over Sevilla FC, moving him into the club's top ten all-time goalscorers. On 14 February 2009, he scored his 99th and his 100th league goals for Barcelona in a 2–2 draw with Real Betis. Eto'o scored his 30th goal of the 2008–09 season in a La Liga match against Real Valladolid. The game ended 1–0 and meant that Barcelona kept a six-point lead over Real Madrid in the league. He also scored against Villarreal CF in the game that put Barcelona one point away from lifting the 2008–09 La Liga trophy. Eto'o scored the opening goal in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United. Barcelona went on to win the final 2–0, thus completing the Treble. Inter Milan. After Maxwell completed the transfer from Inter Milan, Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter Milan for Zlatan Ibrahimović to join the club in exchange for Eto'o and €46 million. After Ibrahimović agreed terms with Barcelona, the club announced Eto'o would travel to Milan for his medical to complete the transfer. On 27 July 2009, Eto'o passed his medical and signed for five years with Inter. On his first press-conference in Milan, he declared that he was where he wanted to be and refused to compare himself to Ibrahimović saying, ""I'm Samuel Eto'o and I don't want to compare myself to anyone. I believe the victories I have earned up to now can contribute to giving the right value to my name."" On 8 August, Eto'o scored his first competitive goal for Inter, in the 2009 Supercoppa Italiana. Two weeks later, Eto'o scored from the penalty spot against Bari in his first Serie A match. In the following match, the Derby della Madonnina, Eto'o won Inter a penalty, after being brought down by Gennaro Gattuso in the box. Gattuso was yellow carded and eventually sent off. Eto'o scored again on 13 September against Parma, his first goal from open play in a Serie A match. At the end of September 2009, Eto'o demanded almost £2.75 million from Barcelona after his transfer to Inter. The amount represented 15% of the US$29 million (£17.7 million) fee which Inter paid Barcelona in July 2009. The demand was based on a Spanish rule that a player should get 15% of the amount of his transfer to another Spanish club. If the parties failed to reach a solution, the matter could go to court. Eto'o scored two goals during a thrilling win over Palermo which ended 5–3, with a brace also being scored by Mario Balotelli. Eto'o also scored in the Champions League Round of 16 against Chelsea, in the second leg, on 16 March 2010, which allowed Inter to progress to the quarter-finals. On 5 May, Eto'o and his teammates helped Inter to lift the Italian Cup after defeating Roma 1–0 at the Stadio Olimpico. Inter's goal was scored by Argentina's Diego Milito. On 22 May 2010, Eto'o played in the third Champions League final of his career, and with Inter Milan's triumph over Bayern Munich, he became the only player to win the treble in consecutive seasons. On 21 August 2010, Eto'o scored twice as Inter Milan beat Roma 3–1 to win the Italian SuperCup. His first hat trick for Inter Milan occurred in the UEFA Champions League against the German team Werder Bremen on 29 September 2010. Inter Milan won the game 4–0, with Eto'o saying, ""We will remain humble because we know that there are sides out there that are better than us, so we will just take it one match at a time and we will go as far as it takes us"". Continuing his outstanding form in Serie A and in the Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter Milan's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave a legendary performance in Munich as he helped Inter Milan eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes into play, as well as provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, ""I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, but I really think it was a great piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I do not want to take anything away from Ibrahimovic, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary."" On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Italian Cup against Palermo to help Inter Milan win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him. Anzhi Makhachkala. On 23 August 2011, Anzhi Makhachkala reached an agreement with Inter Milan to sign Eto'o in a three-year deal that made him the world's highest paid player, with a salary of €20 million after tax per season. Chelsea. On 29 August 2013, Eto'o signed an one-year deal with English side Chelsea, for an undisclosed fee. He reportedly took a huge pay cut from €20 million a season down to €8 million to sign for Chelsea. International career. Eto'o earned his first cap with one day before his 16th birthday on 9 March 1997, in a 5–0 friendly loss to . In 1998, he was the youngest participant in the 1998 FIFA World Cup when he appeared in a 3–0 group stage loss to Italy on 17 June 1998, at the age of 17 years and three months. Eto'o scored his sole goal of the 2002 World Cup when he netted the game-winner against Saudi Arabia during the group stage on 6 June 2002, which was Cameroon's only win of the competition. Eto'o was a part of the squads that won the 2000 and 2002 Africa Cup of Nations, and was a gold medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics. At the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which Cameroon finished as runners-up, he scored his only goal in a 1–0 group-stage upset of Brazil on 19 June. Cameroon were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations after Eto'o missed the decisive penalty in a 12–11 penalty shootout loss to Côte d'Ivoire following a 1–1 draw, but he nonetheless finished as the top scorer of the tournament with five goals. He missed a team practice before the quarter-finals to attend the CAF African Footballer of the Year award ceremonies in Togo. In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, Eto'o became joint leading goalscorer (along with Laurent Pokou) in the competition's history after scoring his 14th goal with a penalty against Zambia on 26 January 2008. In the following game against Sudan, on 30 January, Eto'o converted another penalty to become the tournament's all time leading scorer, followed by another goal in the same match that took his Cup of Nations tally to 16. He finished as the top scorer for the second consecutive tournament, matching his 2006 total of five goals. On 1 June 2008, Eto'o headbutted reporter Philippe Bony, following an incident at a press conference. Bony suffered an injury, but Eto'o later apologized for the altercation, offering to pay Bony's medical expenses. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Gabon, Eto'o scored a goal in the 68th minute. He followed it up with another goal in the home fixture. He lead the scoring chart with eight qualification goals. Eto'o scored in the World Cup qualification match against Morocco to win Cameroon a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament. On 1 December 2009, Eto'o finished fifth in voting for the Ballon d'Or, which was won by his former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi. On 19 June 2010, Eto'o scored a goal in Cameroon's 2010 World Cup group stage match against Denmark, from a mistake by Christian Poulsen. Cameroon eventually lost the game 2–1 and was eliminated from the World Cup. Eto'o described it as the biggest disappointment of his career. In December 2010, Eto'o became the first man to be named African Player of the Year for a fourth time. On 16 December 2011, Eto'o was suspended for fifteen games by the Fédération Camerounaise de Football, after the team refused to play a friendly against earlier this year. The ban was reduced to eight months in January 2012, meaning Eto'o will only miss four competitive matches. The change was brought about after Cameroon president Paul Biya asked officials to reconsider the controversial sanction. On 27 August 2012, Eto'o was in the squad to face Cape Verde in the first leg of a qualification play-off for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, but the striker refused to play, as a protest against what he described as the ""amateurish and poorly organised"" national team set-up. After an intervention from the country's Prime Minister, Philemon Yang, Eto'o agreed to return for the second leg. However, Eto'o's return was not enough for Cameroon to overturn a 0–2 first leg deficit, and the ""Indomitable Lions"" failed to qualify for the Cup of Nations. On 23 March 2013, Eto'o scored his first goal for Cameroon in 16 months with a penalty kick against Togo in a 2014 World Cup qualifier. He went on to score an 82nd minute winning goal in the same match, sending Cameroon to the top of their qualifying group. International goals. Source: Personal life. Eto'o has two brothers who are also footballers: David and Étienne. Eto'o has four children: Maelle, Étienne, Siena and Lynn. He married his longtime sweetheart Georgette on 6 July 2007. Georgette is the mother of Siena and Lynn, who both live with her in Paris, France. Earnings. Samuel Eto'o is the world's second highest-earning sportsperson, after the golfer Tiger Woods. He is the highest-paid footballer in the world, earning £35.7 million (over $54 million) per year, excluding off-field endorsements. Racism. Eto'o has experienced racial abuse in some away matches. He is one of several high-profile contemporary players to have reacted to the abuse by threatening to leave the pitch and being outspoken in criticism of their experiences. In February 2005, during an away match with Real Zaragoza, Eto'o was the subject of racist taunts by Zaragoza supporters, who began making monkey-like chants onto the pitch whenever he had possession of the ball. The referee, however, Fernando Carmona Méndez, made no mention of the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behavior of the crowd was ""normal""; two of the abusers were caught and given five-month sporting-event bans after being identified to police by other spectators. Eto'o later declared that the punishment was insufficient and that La Romareda should have been closed for at least one year, but his manager Frank Rijkaard, who is also of African origin, told him to concentrate on football and to stop talking about the incident. Infuriated again by Zaragoza fans' racist chants the next season, however, Eto'o attempted to walk off the pitch in protest. His teammates intervened and convinced him to continue playing.  After experiencing regular racist abuse from sections of support in Spanish crowds, Eto'o stopped bringing family members to matches. He stated ""It is something that has affected me personally. I think players, leaders, and the media have to join forces so that no one feels looked down upon because of the colour of their skin. At this moment in time I prefer my children don't go to football matches. In the stands they have to listen to things that are difficult to explain to a child. It is better they aren't exposed to it.""  On 17 October 2010, in a Serie A game against Cagliari, after just three minutes of play, the referee halted the match to give a warning to some Cagliari fans who were singing racist chants towards Eto'o. After play was resumed, the rest of the stadium chanted loudly in an attempt to drown out the racist chants in order for the match not to be stopped. Inter went on to win 1–0 with an Eto'o goal in the 39th minute. "
wikipedia-1303693," Mann & Machine  Mann & Machine is an American science fiction/police drama series that aired for nine episodes on NBC from April 5, 1992 to July 14, 1992. Synopsis. Created by Dick Wolf and Robert De Laurentis, the series starred Yancy Butler as Sgt. Eve Edison, a beautiful police officer who is also a sophisticated gynoid robot capable of learning and emotion. She is partnered with Det. Bobby Mann (David Andrews), a human officer who holds disdain for robots. Rounding out the regular cast was S. Epatha Merkerson as Capt. Claghorn, Mann and Edison's superior—a role almost identical to that which Merkerson would later play on Wolf's ""Law & Order"" series. The series focused on Mann and Edison's criminal investigations in a Los Angeles of the ""near future""—sometime around the beginning of the 21st century though the exact year is never stated. An ongoing subplot of the series focused on Eve's continuing education about what makes humans tick, and her ever-growing capacity for emotion, highlighted by the penultimate episode ""Billion Dollar Baby"" in which Eve is placed in charge of caring for an infant, activating unexpected maternal feelings. Although Butler received good reviews for her performance in one of her first major roles, the series was criticized heavily, with many comparing it to a failed 1970s comedy series with a similar premise, ""Holmes & Yo-Yo"". The series was pulled from NBC's schedule after only four episodes. The remaining five were aired as summertime filler. A year after the series was cancelled, Yancy Butler starred in another Dick Wolf creation, the action adventure series ""South Beach"". "
wikipedia-1303713," Self-insertion  Self-insertion is a literary device in which a character who is the real author of a work of fiction appears as a character within that fiction, either overtly or in disguise. The device should not be confused with a first-person narrator, or an author surrogate, or a character somewhat based on the author, whether intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as ""unintentional"" self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate. "
wikipedia-1303719," Council of Scientific and Industrial Research  Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) established in 1942, is an autonomous body and India's largest research and development (R&D) organisation, with 37 laboratories and 39 field stations or extension centres spread across the nation, with a collective staff of over 17,000. Although CSIR is mainly funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, it operates as an autonomous body registered under the Registration of Societies Act of 1860. The research and development activities of CSIR includes various fields such as aerospace engineering, Structural engineering, ocean sciences, Life sciences, metallurgy, chemicals, mining, food, petroleum, leather, and environment. In December 2006, Director General Raghunath A. Mashelkar, retired following which M. K. Bhan took over the post, but he was relieved on 7 March 2007. After that T. Ramasami had the additional charge of Director General of CSIR until Samir K. Brahmachari was appointed as the Director General on 13 November 2007.  In late 2007, the Minister of Science and Technology, Kapil Sibal admitted, in a Question Hour session of the Parliament, that CSIR has developed 1,376 technologies/knowledgebase during the last decade of 20th century. History. In 1930s the need for establishing research organisations for the development of natural resources and new industries in India began to emerge. Eminent citizens such as C. V. Raman, Lt. Col. Seymour Sewell and J. C. Ghosh had proposed the creation of an advisory board of scientific research. Sir Richard Gregory, then editor of ""Nature"", was among the first people who officially reported to the British Government. After visiting scientific departments and universities in India in 1933, Gregory submitted to Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for India, regarding the need of scientific organisation similar to the DSIR in Britain. Indian scientists at Calcutta and Bangalore initiated schemes to launch a National Institute of Sciences and an Indian Academy of Sciences, respectively. At the Fifth Industries Conference in 1933, the Provincial Governments of Bombay, Madras, Bihar and Orissa unanimously reiterated their demand for a co-ordinating forum for industrial research. Hoare advised the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, to support the demand. However, in May 1934, Willingdon replied Hoare saying, ""The creation of a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in India to promote the application of research to natural resources does not appear to be necessary."" The Indian DSIR was rejected, however, the colonial government provided a small concession. It instead offered to create an Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau, which came into operation in April 1935 under the Indian Stores Department. The Bureau's limited resources (with a budget of INR 1.0 lakh per annum) made it impossible to initiate major research and industrial activities as had hoped for. It was mainly concerned with testing and quality control. At the onset of World War II in 1939, the bureau was proposed to be abolished. Urguably, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar became the most instrumental in the creation of CSIR in India. As a member of Viceroy’s executive council, and also of Commerce, he recommended that the Bureau should be terminated, not as a measure of economy, but to make room for a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, which should be endowed with greater resources and wider objectives. It was by this persistence that the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was created on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Mudaliar became the chair of the board. It was at this point that Bhatnagar was appointed to pilot the board, as the Director. The BSIR was allocated an annual budget of INR 500,000 under the Department of Commerce. By the end of 1940, about 80 researchers were engaged, of whom one-quarter was directly employed. Major achievements of BSIR included development of the techniques for the purification of Baluchistan sulphur anti-gas cloth manufacture, vegetable oil blends as fuel and lubricants, plastic packing cases for army boots and ammunition, dyes for uniforms and the preparation of vitamins, and the invention of a pyrethrum emulsifier and cream. In early 1941 Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) for translating results into application. The government then agreed to make a separate fund out of the royalties received from industry for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar recommended that an Industrial Research Fund should be constituted, which would have an annual grant of INR 1,000,000 (one million) for a period of five years. This was accepted by the Central Assembly in Delhi at its session on 14 November 1941.  Then the constitution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as an autonomous body was prepared under Mudaliar and Bhatnagar. Thus, CSIR came into operation on 28 September 1942. The BSIR and IRUC were incorporated into the advisory bodies to the governing body of the CSIR. In 1943 the governing body of CSIR approved the proposal of Bhatnagar, though the initiative of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, to establish five national laboratories — the National Chemical Laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station, and the Glass and Ceramics Research Institute. In 1944 in addition to its annual budget of INR 1 million, CSIR received a grant of INR 10 million for the establishment of these laboratories. The Tata Industrial House donated INR 2 million for the chemical, metallurgical and fuel research laboratories. The foundation for the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute at Kolkata was the first to be laid, in December 1945; and that for the National Chemical Laboratory at Pune was the last, on 6 April 1947, four months before India became independent. All the five establishments were completed by 1950. Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology. The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) Prizes are awarded annually by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for notable and outstanding research, applied or fundamental, in biological, chemical, earth, atmosphere, ocean and planetary, engineering, mathematical, medical and physical sciences. Controversy. CSIR has been flagged in ongoing efforts to root out corruption in India. Despite being established with the directive to do translational research and create real technologies, CSIR has been accused of devolving into an ritualistic, overly-bureaucratic organization that does little more than churn out papers.  There are many issues facing Indian scientists, with some - such as MIT systems scientist VA Shiva Ayyadurai - calling for transparency, a meritocratic system, and an overhaul of the bureaucratic agencies that oversee science and technology. Sumit Bhaduri stated, “challenges of turning Indian science into part of an innovation process are many. … Many competent Indian scientists aspire to be ineffectual administrators [due to administrative power and political patronage, rather than do the kind of science that makes a difference.” Prime minister Manmohan Singh spoke at the 99th Indian Science Congress and commented on the state of the sciences in India, after an advisory council informed him there were problems with “the overall environment for innovation and creative work” and a ‘warlike’ approach was needed.

wikipedia-1303737," Stephen Gately  Stephen Patrick David Gately (17 March 197610 October 2009) was an Irish pop singer-songwriter, actor, children's writer and dancer, who, with Ronan Keating, was one of two lead singers of the pop group Boyzone. Gately and Keating originally served as co-frontmen, but Keating gradually became more synonymous with the group as time went on. All of Boyzone's studio albums hit number one in the United Kingdom, their third being their most successful internationally. With Boyzone, Gately had a record-breaking sixteen consecutive singles enter the top five of the UK Singles Chart. He performed for millions of fans globally. He released a solo album in 2000, after the group's initial break-up, which charted in the UK top ten and yielded three UK hit singles, including the top three hit ""New Beginning"". Gately went on to appear variously in stage productions and on television programmes as well as contributing songs to various projects. In 2008, he rejoined his colleagues as Boyzone reformed for a series of concerts and recordings. Gately wed Andrew Cowles, first in a commitment ceremony in Las Vegas in 2003 and more formally in a civil partnership ceremony in London in 2006. Gately made his sexuality known in 1999 and came out in a blaze of publicity. Upon Boyzone's reformation, Gately featured as part of the first gay couple in the music video for ""Better"", in what was to be his last with the band. Gately died in a flat that he and Cowles owned in Majorca, Spain, on 10 October 2009. Brian Boyd in ""The Irish Times"" stated: ""Stephen Gately’s death represents the first time that the boyband genre has had to deal with such a tragic situation"". Tim Teeman of ""The Times"" (UK) heralded Gately as a hero of gay rights for his response to being ""smoked out of the closet"". Early life and family. Gately grew up in relative poverty in the working-class Sheriff Street area of Dublin. He was the fourth of five children; his father Martin is a former decorator and his mother, Margaret (born 1949) a cleaner. His siblings are Michelle, Tony, Alan and Mark. Gately was raised Catholic. He was particularly close to sister Michelle throughout his life. Gately's father had an accident as a result of which he had to be hospitalised for three months from September 2004, and has not returned to work. His mother then took over as full-time carer. Gately attended primary school at St Laurence O'Toole's and secondary school at North Strand Technical College. As a teenager he appeared in various musicals and theatre performances at school, such as ""Juno and the Paycock"". He was estranged from his parents for years, but reconciled with them in 2008, and visited them with Andrew Cowles that year. Career. Boyzone. Gately joined Boyzone upon their formation in 1993. The group became known in Ireland after an infamous appearance on ""The Late Late Show"" that year, which presenter Gay Byrne dismissed—although he later concluded: ""They certainly had the last laugh on us"". Boyzone's first success outside Ireland was when the song ""Love Me for a Reason"" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1995. The group split suddenly following a string of performances in Dublin's Point Theatre in 2000. By the time Boyzone originally rested the band, they had achieved six number ones on the UK Singles Chart. They were considered a major pop band of the 1990s and had a much publicised rivalry with UK boy band Take That, even selling more singles than them. Gately shared the majority of lead vocal work with Ronan Keating. A February appearance at the 2008 Meteor Awards relaunched the reformed Boyzone, with touring taking place throughout 2008. After his death, manager Louis Walsh described Gately as ""the glue in Boyzone, he kept them all together"". Keating informed the congregation at Gately's funeral that he had nicknames for them all; ""the campest straight band in the world""—Rosaleen, Michaela, Kitty, Shanice and Stephanie. Solo career. After success with Boyzone, the band decided in 2000 to move on to solo projects. Gately was the first, with his debut solo single, ""New Beginning"", released on 29 May 2000. The single reached number three in the UK charts. Two weeks later the album ""New Beginning"" was released and entered the charts. The album included twelve tracks including a version of the classic ""Bright Eyes"", which he recorded for the soundtrack to the TV version of ""Watership Down"". He also voiced one of the characters in the series, Blackavar, which was created to look like him. His character only spoke for 3 episodes, before becoming a background character. The second single taken from the album was ""I Believe"". Released on 2 October 2000, this song also featured on the soundtrack to the film ""Billy Elliot"". The single just missed the UK top ten, peaking at number eleven. He attended the premieres of the film both at the Edinburgh Film Festival and at the Empire, Leicester Square, along with the stars of the film, Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. In May 2001, Gately's third single, ""Stay"", was released and reached number thirteen in the UK chart. That month, with his single still in the charts, his record company Polydor dropped him from their label. In January 2007, Gately was heard in ""Horror of Glam Rock"", a ""Doctor Who"" audio drama produced by Big Finish Productions for BBC7. For this audio play, Gately recorded an original song, ""Children of Tomorrow"", with music by Tim Sutton and lyrics by Barnaby Edwards; this was his first solo track since 2001. Boyzone's reformation. In 2008 following his solo career and various bouts of acting and television appearances, Gately rejoined his old colleagues when Boyzone reformed, following the success of revived contemporaries Take That. Gately had been the most eager to reform and urged his bandmates to come together again. They sold out two more tours of the United Kingdom. Boyzone released a brand new single, ""Love You Anyway"", followed by a new compilation album in October 2008. December 2008 saw the release of a second new single, ""Better"". The video for the song generated controversy, as scenes depicting romantic couples included a shot of two men embracing, in an inclusive nod to Gately's homosexuality. The group unanimously agreed that Gately should be allowed to pair with a male actor. It was condemned by, among others, the minister of the Dromore Reformed Presbyterian Church. Others, however, cite that milestone as among the reasons why Gately is a ""gay rights hero"". Wrote Tim Teeman of the ""Times Online"", ""Gately showed that an unflamboyant guy could be a pop star and gay...the real shame should be reserved for those managers and showbusiness power-brokers who practise that kind of discrimination, and also maintain the closet, to line their pockets."" At the time of Gately's death the group had selected thirty songs which they intended to record for a new album to be released in 2010. This was to have been followed by a tour. Acting and television. In December 2002, Gately took the lead role in Bill Kenwright's new production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"", which previewed in Oxford in December 2002 before moving to Liverpool over Christmas 2002 and finally to London's West End and the New London Theatre in Drury Lane in February 2003. From September 2004 until March 2005 Gately played the Child Catcher in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" at the London Palladium. In 2001 he made a cameo as himself in the fourth series of BBC sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"", in that series opening episode 'Parralox'. Gately made his pantomime debut at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley in December 2005 starring as Dandini in ""Cinderella"". In April 2006 he took on the role of The Scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz"" at the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury. Gately also took part in Channel Five's ""All Star Talent Show"" in October 2006, performing the slice and dice magic trick which he only had a week to learn, coming second to Toby Anstis. He was also in the second series of ITV's ""Dancing on Ice"" with his dancing partner Kristina Lenko. They went out in eighth place on 10 February 2007. In March 2007, Gately provided his vocal talents to the Big Finish Productions ""Doctor Who"" audio play, ""Horror of Glam Rock"". In September 2007, Gately began touring the UK in an 11-week run of Stephen Schwartz's rock musical ""Godspell"", but withdrew from the production after just three weeks for contractual reasons. In 2008, Gately appeared in the independent horror film, ""Credo"" which was released in the United States as ""Devil's Curse"". Philanthropy. Gately was a vice patron of the charity Missing People (formerly National Missing Persons Helpline), supporting their Runaway Helpline service for young people. He was an ambassador for the Caudwell Children Charity in Stoke and on one occasion gave a private Christmas performance, raising thousands of pounds. Gately's family requested that donations be given to the charity instead of flowers sent to them after his death in 2009. This in turn raised thousands more pounds. On one visit to a hospital he met a child who fell in love with his jacket—Gately allowed her to have it; she was dead within the hour. Writing. During the three years prior to his death, Gately had been writing a children's fantasy novel called ""The Tree of Seasons"". In an April 2009 interview with the Press Association he declared that he was nearly finished, had publisher interest, and hoped for a Christmas 2009 release. Boyzone bandmate Ronan Keating promised at Gately's funeral that ""by hook or by crook"" the book would be finished. ""The Tree of Seasons"" was written in collaboration with June Considine and Jules Williams . Based on Gately's handwritten notes – the day he died he had just worked out the ending. The book released in the UK and Ireland on 13 May 2010, published by Hodder & Stoughton. It contains a foreword by Elton John and David Furnish, and is illustrated by Keith Wilson. ""The Tree of Seasons"" remained a best seller and a top ten seller for three consecutive weeks. The paperback version will be released in April 2011 Personal life. Gately came out as gay in 1999 after discovering that someone was planning to sell a story revealing his sexuality to a newspaper. Although he was effectively smoked out of the closet, he has been hailed as a champion of gay rights, albeit a reluctant one. From 2000 to 2002, Gately suffered from depression and addiction to prescription drugs. Gately started dating Andrew Cowles, an internet businessman, who had been introduced to him by mutual friends Elton John and David Furnish. Gately and Cowles held a commitment ceremony in a wedding chapel whilst on holiday in Las Vegas in 2003. On 19 March 2006, Gately entered into a civil partnership with Cowles in a ceremony in London. The couple lived together in the North London village of Highgate. Gately spoke of his love for the village, saying he ""wouldn't move away for the world. It has a great vibe and the people here are brilliant"". In July 2009, their home was broken into by thieves who took £80,000 of items, including a prized Rolex watch which Gately had purchased with his first pay cheque. Gately was based in London until his death. His manager Louis Walsh was unaware of Gately's sexuality when he selected him for Boyzone and has said that, had he known, he would have thought twice before picking him, claiming less than a year before his death that ""it wasn't cool then to have a gay guy in a band"". Walsh described Gately as his ""very, very best friend"" after the singer's death, saying: ""Of all the people I've worked with I don't think anybody thanked me as much as Stephen. He used to always say to me, 'If I wasn't in Boyzone I don't know where I'd be today, thank you'"". Death. Gately died suddenly at his flat in Port d'Andratx, Majorca, early on 10 October 2009. His body was discovered later in the morning. His death was later determined to have been caused by a pulmonary edema resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition. Gately had spent the evening with his partner Cowles at the Black Cat club in Majorca's capital Palma. They returned home with someone that they had met that night, Bulgarian Georgi Dochev. Dochev stayed in the spare bedroom. According to Dochev, he discovered Gately's body lying on a sofa as he was about to leave. He woke Cowles, who was sleeping alone in the couple's bedroom. However, Gately's solicitor and family friend, Gerald Kean, insisted Cowles was the one who found Gately's body. Spanish police were alerted at 1:45 pm by Cowles, after he had tried to revive Gately. Gately was squatting in an awkward way on the sofa, dressed in his pyjamas. Police said they had no reason to believe the death was related to abuse of substances such as drugs or alcohol and no suicide note or signs of violence were located on the corpse. Gerald Kean, acting as spokesman for the Gately family, said that foul play and suicide had been ruled out, describing it as ""just a tragic accident"". It was Kean, Gately's solicitor throughout his career, who informed Ronan Keating that Gately had died. Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was expected to join them soon after. The surviving members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He died as a result of a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening. On 16 October, accompanied by the four surviving members of Boyzone, his body was brought from Majorca to Dublin where his funeral took place at the Church of St Laurence O'Toole the following day. The four surviving members of Boyzone maintained an overnight vigil in the church the night before. Thousands of fans, celebrities and politicians were in attendance at the funeral. Fans had travelled from as far as Nottingham, South Africa and Taiwan to attend the funeral. He was cremated in a private ceremony later that afternoon. Gately's coffin was carried into and out of the church by his bandmates, and during the service Ronan Keating gave an emotional eulogy, during which he broke down several times and apologised to the congregation. Keith Duffy reminisced on the early days: ""He told Louis he was 5ft 7in. When he auditioned for ""The Hobbit"" later on, he said he was 5ft 3in. But he was a true giant of a man"". Mikey Graham said Gately had only told him the previous week how much he loved Cowles, adding: ""When he came out, he finally became himself"". The funeral clashed with the wedding of a niece of Bertie Ahern and several of her guests defected to the funeral instead. Reaction. Fans responded with messages of sympathy on the social networking websites Twitter and Facebook. Thousands of pounds have been donated by fans to a Stoke-based children's charity which Gately had endorsed. The Google search term ""Stephen Gately"" was said to have ""risen exponentially"" and remained at the top for several days after the singer's death and was later confirmed as being the most searched for topic on Google's UK site in 2009. The search term ""Boyzone"" also ranked highly, being separated from ""Stephen Gately"" only by second-placed searches for ""Nobel Peace Prize"" following a controversial award to U.S. President Barack Obama. Boyzone's record catalogue was propelled back into the music charts. The single ""No Matter What"", on which Gately is a prominent vocalist, received heavy play on radio. Boyzone manager Louis Walsh is quoted as saying: ""We're all absolutely devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet. I only heard after ""The X Factor"" (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man."" Walsh dropped out of the 11 October 2009 live results show of ""The X Factor"" as a direct result of Gately's death. Simon Cowell addressed the issue at the start of the programme. He said: ""This is really, really tragic news I want to send out my condolences to the family, our thoughts are with Louis"". That edition of the show attracted an ""absolutely huge"" audience which was said to have been seeking updates on the singer's death. Walsh also was absent from the second week of ""The X Factor"" which coincided with Gately's funeral,—later commenting: ""I never want to watch the show at home again. I've been shouting at the TV all night""—at which Walsh was too upset to speak. ""My First Time"", a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely. Duffy, Graham, Keating and Lynch had memorial ""76 09"" tattoos (Gately's birth and death years) engraved on their bodies when they brought Gately's body home. Irish boyband Westlife said: ""We are, like everyone else, in shock today. We met Stephen Gately back in ‘98 when we first started out and since then have had the pleasure of meeting him many times. He and the Boyzone lads paved the way for us as a band. He was a friendly, positive spirit and a passionate performer. Our thoughts are with Andy and the rest of his family, his friends, his legions of fans and of course his bandmates Keith, Mikey, Shane and Ronan who will be devastated at the loss of a truly beautiful person."". Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said: ""It's so sad. Boyzone and Stephen, they've all been part of Irish life and far wider than that, the last 15 years, and so successful, so it's a huge, huge tragedy. He was 33 years of age, 15 years at the top, a fine musician, it's just a huge tragedy to Irish entertainment, Irish music and further afield as well"". Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen paid tribute: ""Stephen Gately was a gifted young man with a talent for singing which brought him tremendous success as a member of Boyzone and also as a West End star. There was a joy about his music making, and his death at such a young age is both a personal and professional loss"". Andrew Lloyd Webber said it is ""a great loss to the musical world"". Elton John said he and his partner David Furnish were ""stunned"" when they heard the news. Katherine Jenkins twittered of ""memories 2 cherish"" from a night out in the weeks leading up to his death. Stephen Fry described Gately's demise as ""a dreadful shock"". ""This was not supposed to happen. This was not in the script"", said music historian Paul Gambaccini. UK television personality Paul O'Grady said he was ""haunted"" by Gately's death and based his decision to move back to ITV from Channel 4 on a phone call with Louis Walsh during which they discussed Gately's death. Bono later paid tribute to Gately during U2's U2 360° Tour worldwide concerts. Jan Moir controversy. An article by Jan Moir in the ""Daily Mail"" on 16 October 2009 claimed: ""Healthy and fit 33-year-old men do not just climb into their pyjamas and go to sleep on the sofa, never to wake up again. Whatever the cause of death is, it is not, by any yardstick, a natural one."" She suggested that drugs and a ""dangerous lifestyle"" were to blame for Gately's death. Moir's article resulted in over 25,000 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that day, causing its site to crash for several hours. Derren Brown and Stephen Fry used Twitter to front an online campaign against the ""Daily Mail"" and Jan Moir throughout the afternoon and a Facebook page was set up urging followers to complain to the brands whose advertisements featured alongside the article. Fry wrote, ""I gather a repulsive nobody writing in a paper no one of any decency would be seen dead with has written something loathesome and inhumane"". Brown wrote, ""If Gateley's passing causes today's kind of gutter-journalism to be held to account, we can perhaps take that as a tribute"". ""Father Ted"" writer Graham Linehan called for a complete boycott of the ""Daily Mail"", tweeting ""Which brands advertise in the ""Mail""? Are they aware of Jan Moir's piece?...what are they going to do about it?"". Details of companies with advertisements on the same web page as Moir's article were posted on a specially established Facebook page named ""The ""Daily Mail"" should retract Jan Moir's hateful, homophobic article"". According to ""The Guardian"" details about where Moir lived were posted on the Internet and a false rumour that the ""Daily Mail"" had reported Cowles as Gately's murderer was repeated on Twitter. The matter became serious enough for retailer Marks & Spencer to request the newspaper to remove an advertisement for its services from anywhere near the vicinity of the article, with the company issuing a statement which read: ""Marks & Spencer does not tolerate any form of discrimination"". Nestlé also disassociated themselves with the article, saying Moir's words contradicted the company's values of ""mutual respect and tolerance, regardless of culture, religion or nationality"". The company's Nescafé brand was featured alongside the article. The ""Daily Mail"" then removed all advertising from the online version of the article. The publication also attempted to alter the original article but this succeeded only in provoking the public further. Moir responded to the controversy by criticising what she claimed was ""clearly a heavily orchestrated internet campaign"" and said it was ""mischievous in the extreme to suggest that my article has homophobic and bigoted undertones"". ""The Guardian""s Charlie Brooker, whilst ""struggling to absorb the sheer scope of [Moir's] hateful idiocy"", accused her of ""dancing"" on Gately's grave before he had even been buried. Caitlin Moran of ""The Times"" said the article was ""vile"". The editor of UK gay magazine ""Attitude"" questioned why Moir linked Gately's death with the recent suicide of the former partner of comedian Matt Lucas, asking ""If that's not homophobic, what is homophobia?"" ""The Daily Telegraph""s Damian Thompson said ""Moir's reputation is in tatters this evening"". The PCC contacted the Gately family and investigated if they receive a formal complaint from them, but stated they were not in a position to act directly on complaints from members of the public. A PCC spokesman said ""We're trying to work out what the complaints are. Offensiveness is not within the remit of the PCC – we deal with accuracy and intrusion."" However, the column featured only in the British version of the newspaper, being removed from the ""Irish Mail"" and replaced instead by positive tributes to the singer's life. According to Sky News, the Gatelys ""are aware of the article, they have not read it, they will not read it, but they know what is contained in it and they know the sentiment"" and ""are just very, very disappointed"". In Ireland itself, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said, ""Some of the papers were waiting to write some sensational piece about him [... I can never understand why people just don't leave things simple"" and one radio station owner, who called on people to write to the ""Mail"" to express their disagreement, commented, ""We are all very very insulted by that coverage. [...] I certainly hope the Irish people force that newspaper's editor to apologise for the great hurt caused by that article"". Scotland Yard received a complaint. Gately's record company also issued a complaint to the PCC. The PCC did not uphold the complaint, stating: ""It found the article caused some offence but there was insufficient evidence it breached the law."" Tony Connell, CPS London complex casework lawyer, said: ""In coming to this conclusion I have paid particular attention to Article 10 of the Human Rights Act which protects individuals' freedom of expression. It is an established legal principle that this freedom applies equally to information and ideas that are favourably received as to those which offend, shock and disturb. Though the complainants and many others found this article offensive, this does not make its publication unlawful."" "
wikipedia-1303753," Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant  Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs) are a class of psychiatric drugs used primarily as antidepressants. They act by antagonizing the α2-adrenergic receptor and certain serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, but also 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and/or 5-HT7 in some cases. By blocking α2-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, NaSSAs enhance adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain involved in mood regulation, notably 5-HT1A-mediated transmission. In addition, due to their blockade of certain serotonin receptors, serotonergic neurotransmission is not facilitated in unwanted areas, which prevents the incidence of many side effects often associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants; hence, in part, the """"specific serotonergic"""" label of NaSSAs. List of NaSSAs. The NaSSAs include the following agents: Notably, all of these compounds are analogues and are also classified as tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) based on their chemical structures. Recently, S32212, a structurally novel NaSSA with an improved selectivity profile (e.g., no antihistamine effects, etc.), has been developed. It has completed preliminary preclinical research and may go on to undergo clinical trials. "
wikipedia-1303755," 4-8-0  Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading truck, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles, and no trailing wheels. In North America and in some other countries the type was known as either the Mastodon or the Twelve-wheeler.  Other equivalent classifications are: Overview. The very first locomotive is believed to have been the ""Centipede"", a tender locomotive built by Ross Winans in 1855 for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the United States of America (USA), where it remained in service for nearly twenty years. It appears to have been delivered in a cab-forward type of configuration that was modified to a Camel configuration in 1864. On a Camel locomotive the cab was mounted atop the boiler, unlike the later Camelback locomotive whose cab straddled the boiler and that first appeared around 1877. The name Mastodon for the wheel arrangement was derived from the unofficial name of the first locomotive of the Central Pacific Railroad in the USA, the wood-fired CPR no. 229, which was designed and built in 1882 by the railroad's master mechanic, Andrew Jackson (A.J.) Stevens, at the railroad’s Sacramento works in California. Usage. Australia. The wheel arrangement saw service in Australia from 1900. In Tasmania the privately owned Emu Bay Railway ordered four tender locomotives for their system. In 1911 another locomotive was delivered from the North British Locomotive Company. Two of these locomotives are preserved. A new class of locomotive, the T class, designed in South Australia for use on the narrow gauge system of the South Australian Railways (SAR), was introduced in 1903. It proved to be a suitable workhorse and by 1917 there were seventy-eight locomotives in the class. In 1921 and 1922 the Tasmanian Government also purchased six of these narrow gauge SAR locomotives and during 1922 and 1923 five of the class were converted to for use on the broad gauge system of the SAR. These were converted back to narrow gauge in 1949. During the Second World War the Commonwealth Railways obtained four of these SAR narrow gauge locomotives on loan. Several of these locomotives are preserved. The Queensland Government Railways (QGR) introduced its C16 class of locomotives in 1903, built at its Ipswich workshops. Altogether 152 of these locomotives were in service by 1917. Beginning in 1920, a number of the QGR C16 class locomotives were equipped with superheaters on an experimental basis, but since their slide valves were not suited to superheated steam and became prone to steam leaks due to excessive wear, they were soon converted back to use saturated steam. During the Second World War the Commonwealth Government also acquired eleven C16 class locomotives on loan. Only one example of this class was preserved. The QGR’s superheated C17 class entered service from 1920. The Commonwealth Railways also ordered twenty-two locomotives of the same design for their narrow gauge rail system, designated the NM class. In total, the C17 class eventually numbered 227 locomotives, of which twenty are preserved. In 1922 the QGR ordered twenty-two new locomotives and designated them the C19 class. They were the largest conventional type locomotives to operate on the QGR. Austria. In Austria, the wheel arrangement was used for express locomotives. The Class 570 locomotive was introduced in 1915 and the class 113 locomotive of the Austrian Federal Railways was introduced in 1923. From 1938, both classes were re-designated as Class 33 on the Deutsche Reichsbahn.  Bechuanaland. In 1897 four Cape 7th Class locomotives were ordered by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from Neilson and Company for use on the new Vryburg to Bulawayo line of the fledgling Bechuanaland Railway Company (BR). The line through Bechuanaland Protectorate (Botswana) was still under construction and was operated by the CGR on behalf of the BR at the time. The locomotives were eventually returned to the CGR and were designated Class 7A on the South African Railways (SAR) in 1912. France. In France the wheel arrangement was used on two locomotive classes. The first was in 1907 by the ""Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée"" (PLM). These locomotives were intended for goods trains, as well as passenger trains on the more difficult routes. They were Baudry type compound locomotives, similar to the De Glehn type, but with their low pressure cylinders set at 60% cut-off. All of them originally used saturated steam, but some were later equipped with superheaters, while all the others were provided with feedwater heaters. These locomotives had a maximum speed limit of and were designed to be able to haul 1,177 long tons at . A total of 282 were built. The PLM had prepared designs for another much larger locomotive by 1913, but it did not materialise as a result of the outbreak of World War I. The second locomotive to appear in France was the famous 240P class of the ""Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français"" (SNCF), with ""240"" in this instance referring to the French classification of wheel arrangement according to the number and arrangement of axles rather than wheels. Technically these locomotives were developments of some of the earliest Pacific locomotives in Europe that were built for the ""Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans"" (PO). The 240P class was considered to be one of André Chapelon's finest designs and benefited from his thorough understanding of thermodynamics and his appreciation of the need to consider the entirety of the steam circuit. The locomotive was a four-cylinder compound, fitted with Lentz-Dabeg poppet valves. Coupled with an elegant French style tender, the second batch of the 240P class was aesthetically much more pleasing. With a power output of , the 240P class was reputed to have the highest power-to-weight ratio of any steam locomotive. Discussion continues as to how robust they were mechanically, for example whether the size of the bearings was too near the bone, or whether they were simply worked to death during the difficult war years. None have survived in preservation. Hungary. In the 1920s the ""Magyar Államvasutak"" (Hungarian State Railways or MÁV) adopted the type as their standard mixed-traffic locomotive in the shape of the 424 class, which was built between 1924 and 1958. Of these, 365 were built for Hungary and 149 for foreign systems, including the Yugoslav Railways, the Soviet Union and North Korea. In Yugoslavia they were designated the ""Jugoslovenske Železnice"" (JŽ) class 11. The last of the Hungarian locomotives were withdrawn from service in 1984.  Ireland. For a short period, the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland and its successor, the Great Southern Railways, operated two inside-cylinder shunting locomotives. Intended for shunting at Dublin Kingsbridge (now Heuston) and for banking on the steep gradient out of Cork Glanmire Road (now Kent), the first locomotive emerged from the company's Inchicore workshops in 1915 and the second in 1924. They proved unsuccessful, being expensive to operate and unsuitable for sharp curves, and were withdrawn in 1928 and 1931 respectively. On the Irish three-foot gauge, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway operated two tender locomotives. Built by Hudswell Clarke, they were introduced in 1905 and withdrawn in the 1930s and 1940s. The two were the only tender locomotives ever to operate on that gauge in Ireland and, with two subsequent tank engines from the same manufacturer, were ""the most powerful which ever worked on any Irish narrow-gauge railway."" Mexico. 4-8-0 locomotives in Mexico were almost entirely built in the United States. The first locomotives were provided by the Southern Pacific Railway to railways, some independent, some subsidiary, such as the Cananae, Rio Yaqui & Pacifico, and the Sud Pacifico de Mejico. The SP de M used, in total, 14 of the Southern Pacific's 4-8-0s, including a few from CRY & P, all constructed at Schenectady between 1889 and 1895. The National Railways of Mexico had four classes of 4-8-0. The first two orders were relatively small locomotives from Brooks in 1897. In 1924, a much larger locomotive was ordered, the PR-7, numbers 5-A to 2856, and weighing 127 tons. Unusually among American built 4-8-0s, these were intended for express passenger service, and so had much larger drivers than 4-8-0s operating in the United States, at 67 inches. The cylinders had an unusually square bore, 28x28 inches. Because the firebox was wide and above the frames, the tops of the last set of drivers projected into the firebox, something only possible due to them being oil fired. In 1935 a further five locomotives were built with larger boilers, which increased the evaporative heating surface by 357sq ft, and superheater surface by 172sq ft. These were designated PR-8, numbers 3000 to 3004. At 144 tons, the PR-8 was the heaviest conventional 4-8-0 ever built; the N&W M2, often credited as being the heaviest conventional 4-8-0, weighed 8,470lb less than the PR-8. New Zealand. New Zealand's first locomotive was built in the Addington Railway Workshops of the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in 1899 and designated B class. Four more were completed that same year and one more in 1901, while Sharp, Stewart and Company built four more over the next two years.  Ten BA class locomotives were built by the NZR at its Addington shops between 1911 and 1913, and thirty BB class locomotives were built by A & G Price in New Zealand between 1915 and 1918. One each of the BA class and BB class have been preserved, BA no. 552 and BB no. 144. Both are in Auckland at the Parnell Depot of Mainline Steam, an organisation devoted to the restoration and operation of historic New Zealand Railways mainline steam locomotives.  Rhodesia. Between 1899 and 1903 fifty-two Cape 7th Class 4-8-0 locomotives were built for the Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways (BMR) that later became a constituent part of the Rhodesia Railways (RR). These locomotives were acquired by Southern Rhodesia at the time when railways were still expanding from the Cape Colony via the Bechuanaland Protectorate into Southern Rhodesia in the southwest, from Beira in Mozambique to Umtali in the east, and while the Anglo-Boer War was still in progress. At the time the system was composed of four smaller railways, all of them still largely under construction, that were eventually all linked up in 1902. These were the fledgling Bechuanaland Railways (BR), the Mashonaland Railways (MR), the Rhodesia Railways Northern Extensions (RRM) and the BMR. The locomotives were ordered in five batches from three British manufacturers, twenty-four from Neilson, Reid and Company in 1899 and 1900, eight from Kitson and Company between 1901 and 1903, and twenty from North British Locomotive Company in 1903. In 1915 five of the Neilson, Reid locomotives were sold to the South African Railways (SAR). South Africa. All locomotives that saw service in South Africa were built for . Following a decision by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) to acquire eight-coupled goods locomotives, a complete design for such a locomotive was prepared at the Salt River works in Cape Town under the supervision of Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty. This became the Cape 7th Class , the legendary locomotive that played a part in the construction of a large part of the railways into the interior of Africa south of the equator. In 1902 and 1903 the CGR and CSAR placed a number of Cape 8th Class locomotives in service. Initially designed in 1901 as a Consolidation by H.M. Beatty, some trouble had been experienced with the leading pony trucks of the first locomotives and it was dropped in favour of a four wheeled bogie in later orders for more locomotives. Because of the limited coal and water range of the existing fleet of Natal Government Railways (NGR) tank locomotives, Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie was tasked to produce a locomotive of greater power and capable of longer distances without refuelling or rewatering, to work the main line’s steep 1 in 30 gradients. The result was the NGR Class Hendrie B. At the end of the Second Boer War the CSAR inherited thirty-five Reid Tenwheeler tank locomotives from the IMR and designated them Class E. The CSAR found them to have an inadequate coal and water supply for trips of any length, and beginning in 1905 twenty-nine of them were converted to tank-and-tender locomotives by removing the trailing bissel bogie, the fifth pair of driving wheels and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding tenders reclaimed from various scrapped locomotives. In 1912 these locomotives were reclassified as Class 13 on the SAR. In 1906 the CGR placed a single experimental 10th Class locomotive in service on the Cape Eastern System. Designed by H.M. Beatty and built by Kitson and Company, it was in most respects a larger and more powerful version of Beatty’s last Cape 8th Class of 1904, the Class 8F on the SAR. Despite its good performance, the design was never repeated since some trouble was experienced with the firebox. In 1912 it was classified as Class Experimental 6 on the SAR. Between 1926 and 1929, when a shortage of suitable shunting locomotives developed as a result of increasing traffic throughout the country and particularly on the Witwatersrand, the SAR rebuilt twenty-one of its Class A 4-8-2T tank locomotives to Class 17 tank-and-tender locomotives. They were modified by removing the trailing bissel bogie and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding a tender to increase the coal and water capacity. Tenders from various scrapped locomotive types were used and they were employed as shunters around Durban and Port Elizabeth. In 1953 two of them were sold to the Zambezi Saw Mills Company for use on their Livingstone-Mulobezi logging railway in Northern Rhodesia. The rest were withdrawn from service by 1961, more than seventy years after the first one was built for the NGR. Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union locomotives were the first passenger engines to be built by the new state after the October Revolution. One hundred of these locomotives were built by the Putilov Works in Leningrad in 1927. Although intended for speeds up to 100km/h, they proved unsteady at speed, and had to be kept to slower trains. Some burned oil. Initially built as three-cylinder locomotives, they were later rebuilt as two-cylinder engines, as there were apparently severe problems with the crank axle, with up to half the engines being out of service at one point due to such troubles. In addition, boiler pressure in the two cylinder rebuilds was raised from 185psi to 206psi, and reclassified Mr (Мр in Cyrillic). The M class was not considered to be a great success.  Spain. RENFE (""Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles""), the Spanish rail system that was nationalised in 1941, inherited locomotives from the Madrid, Zaragoza and Alicante Railway and continued to construct the type as its 240F class. The last survivors, all oil-burners, were concentrated at the Salamanca shed around 1970.  United Kingdom. Two classes of tank locomotives were used in the United Kingdom, both built for hump shunting. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway both contemplated the construction of tender freight locomotives, but these never materialised. United States of America. In the United States the was essentially a freight locomotive that was a development of the Consolidation. Most American locomotives were built in the late 19th century or early 20th century. The type never achieved great popularity, although there were four occasions when a specific locomotive was considered as the ""heaviest and/or most powerful in the world"" upon its introduction. Those locomotives were the no. 20 ""Champion"" of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1880, the no. 229 ""Mastodon"" of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1882, the G5 class of the Great Northern Railway in 1897, and the no. 640 of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1899. It is noteworthy that the Great Northern G5 had piston valves, as large as the pistons of many locomotives then in service. Even though, at the time, the wide-firebox Mikado had much more potential as far as speed is concerned, the Norfolk and Western Railway opted for the class M for its shorter wheelbase that enabled it to have over 90 percent of the locomotive's weight on the driving wheels, and the four-wheel leading truck for greater stability. Built by Baldwin Locomotive Works from 1906 and nicknamed ""Mollies"", the class M, class M1 and class M2 became the most numerous American class of . The class M2 locomotives are often mistakingly believed to be the largest conventional built, but the Mexican PR-8 was over four tons heavier. Many of them lasted into the 1950s. Zambia. In November 1953 the Zambezi Saw Mills Company (ZSM) in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia since 1964) purchased two Class 17 tank-and-tender locomotives from the South African Railways (SAR) for use on their Livingstone-Mulobezi logging railway. The company worked the teak forests that stretched to the north-west of Livingstone and it built one of the longest logging railways in the world to serve its sawmill at Mulobezi. The locomotives were scrapped between 1961 and 1963. In 1966 two Class 7, four Class 7A and two Class 7B locomotives were also purchased by the ZSM from the SAR. These eight locomotives joined the existing fleet of eight ex Rhodesia Railways Class 7 locomotives that had been acquired by the ZSM between 1925 and 1956. After being retired, one was configured as a stationary boiler at Livingstone. In November 1971 the ZSM also purchased one Class 8A locomotive from the SAR. This was the last locomotive to be purchased by the logging company and it was employed as a shunter at Mulobezi after logging operations ceased. It was returned to Livingstone in December 1975 and was eventually preserved at the Railway Museum at Livingstone. "
wikipedia-1303837," Gradus ad Parnassum  The Latin phrase Gradus ad Parnassum means ""Steps to Parnassus"" (see below). It is sometimes shortened to Gradus. The name Parnassus was used to denote the loftiest part of a mountain range in central Greece, a few miles north of Delphi, of which the two summits, in Classical times, were called ""Tithorea"" and ""Lycoreia"". In Greek mythology, one of the peaks was sacred to Apollo and the nine Muses, the inspiring deities of the arts, and the other to Bacchus. The phrase has often been used to refer to various books of instruction, or guides, in which gradual progress in literature, language instruction, music, or the arts in general, is sought. Classics. The first application of the phrase is to a kind of Latin or Greek dictionary, in which the quantities of the vowels are marked in the words, to help beginners to understand the principles of Latin verse composition, in relation to the values of the metrical feet. The first 'step' or lesson is contained in the title phrase itself, because 'gradus' being a fourth-declension noun (a step), with a short '-us' in the singular (forming a metrical trochee), becomes 'gradūs', with a lengthened '-ūs', in the plural (steps) - forming a metrical spondee. The difference in meaning teaches one to observe the difference in vowel quantity between two forms which look the same but have different grammatical properties, and so to pronounce the title of the dictionary correctly. Then 'Parnassus' is a poetic figure alluding to the Muse (of poetry): and the second function of the Thesaurus is even so, to illustrate such figures. Therefore the whole expression ""Gradus ad Parnassum"" is not just a title but an epitome of the work itself, combining declension, construction, scansion and figure. The ""Gradus ad Parnassum"" made famous under the name of Jesuit Paul Aler (1656-1727), a schoolmaster, published in 1686, presented anew an earlier Thesaurus attributed to Pierre Joulet, sieur de Chastillon (1545-1621). This was not a general dictionary but a thesaurus of synonyms, epithets, verses and phrases in classical poetic usage. The work in Alers' form existed into the 19th century with the definitions as well as the entries written in Latin. Known to many generations of students throughout Europe, and passing through numerous editions, 19th century English-speaking schoolchildren knew the 1818 revision by Dr John Carey (1756-1826) simply as 'Carey's Gradus'. It was specially intended for the study and appreciation of Latin poetry of the classical period, and to aid students in the practice of verse composition. There is also a Latin gradus by C.D. Yonge (1850); English-Latin by AC Ainger and HG Wintle (1890); Latin-French by F.J.M. Noël (1810); Greek by Thomas Morell (1762, new ed. ed. by E. Maltby, Bishop of Durham, 1815); John Brasse (1828). The large general dictionaries of Greek and Latin adopted this pattern of information. For example, the Liddell-Scott-Jones ""Greek-English Lexicon"" (1843) and its current derivatives give quantity information where it is crucial and where it is available; so do Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short's ""A Latin Dictionary"" (1879) and its derivatives. The synonyms, epithets, poetical expressions and extracts became incorporated under the more important headings.

wikipedia-1303850," Louny  Louny (; ) is a town in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It is situated on the River Ohře. History. The first city foundation called Redintuinum took part in the 2nd century proved on Ptolemios`map.Part of the settlers moved westward and made way for Slaves. In the 12/13th century Germans resettled again.  The city was founded in the 12th century (the first known written record dates from 1115). The Church of St Peter stands on the site of the original fort. The original name was ""Luna"", which is retained in the name of a local park, ""Pramen Luna"", and accounts for the Moon as part of the town's emblem. The town developed and expanded during the reign of Ottokar I of Bohemia, although the Thirty Years' War depopulated the city. The second half of the 19th century witnessed the economic growth of the area. Until 1918, ""LAUN - LOUNY"" was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the district of the same name, one of the 94 ""Bezirkshauptmannschaften"" in Bohemia. The town lies on a railway junction and a factory for overhauling railway engines and rolling stock was established in 1873 which became a major employer and contributed to the town's expansion during the early 20th century. The former state company has now been privatized, but remains the town's largest employer with a workforce of 750. Other industries include a brewery (from the hops which grown in the region) and a factory making porcelain electrical insulators for power cables, etc. The town's architecture was formed mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries when many old buildings were torn down. Nevertheless, the most important architectural feature is Roman Catholic St. Nicholas Church, erected between 1517 and 1537 in the late Gothic style. One of the architects was Benedikt Rejt. It incorporates a tower from an earlier church which was otherwise destroyed along with most of the town by a major fire in 1517. Parts of the city ramparts remain, as does the Žatec gate which dates from 1500 but was reconstructed in 1872. An Open-Air Museum of Archeology is located in nearby Březno. "
wikipedia-1303857," Electricity liberalization  Electricity liberalization refers to the liberalization of electricity markets. As electricity supply is a natural monopoly, this entails complex and costly systems of regulation to enforce a system of competition. The standard model for electricity liberalization is the ""British model"", after the British system which began in the late 1980s with the privatization and vertical de-integration of the United Kingdom electricity industry. At a cost of over $3bn, a system of competition was developed to auction spare capacity through a central system. The risks involved for both generators and distributors have led to vertical re-integration.  Liberalization of electricity tends to substantially benefit large consumers (mainly industrial users), but benefits for domestic consumers compared with a public monopoly or a regulated private monopoly are questionable. There are also doubts over whether the system can ensure long-term security of supply through providing sufficient incentives to begin building generation capacity in time for when it is needed. Electricity markets in the European Union are governed by the Internal Market in Electricity directive. "
wikipedia-1303859," So Long a Letter  So Long a Letter (translated from ""Une si longue lettre"") is a semi-autobiographical novel originally written in French by the Senegalese writer Mariama Bâ. Its theme is the condition of women in Western African society. ""So Long a Letter"", Mariama Bâ's first novel, is literally written as a long letter. As the novel begins, Ramatoulaye Fall is beginning a letter to her lifelong friend Aissatou Bâ. The occasion for writing is Ramatoulaye's recent widowhood. As she gives her friend the details of her husband's death, she recounts the major events in their lives. Ramatoulaye's husband, Modou Fall, died suddenly of a heart attack. Following the strictures of her Muslim faith, Ramatoulaye must remain in seclusion (Mirasse) for a period of forty days. Aissatou, to whom the letter is written, emigrated to the United States and pursued a feminist, monogamist relationship. The novel is often used in literature classes focusing on women's roles in post-colonial Africa. Characters. Ramatoulaye: The widowed Senegalese woman who, after 25 years of marriage and 12 children, narrates the story of her psychological abandonment by her husband, who takes a second wife. Ramatoulaye physically distances herself from Modou who dies four years after this second marriage. Ramatoulaye turns down two other marriage proposals, including that of Daouda Dieng. She is well educated and teaches at a university. After her husband's second marriage, she must support her family, including her 12 children, since her husband cuts off family ties and financial support.  Modou: The husband of Ramatoulaye and of Binetou. He was well educated, handsome, and charming. For his own selfish desires, he marries Binetou and cuts ties with his 12 children and first wife, Ramatoulaye. He later dies of a heart attack. Mawdo: Ex-husband of Aïssatou.After being pressured by his mother, Mawdo follows Muslim tradition of polygamy and marries a young girl named Nabou, who is also his first cousin. After his marriage with Nabou, Aïssatou (his first wife) divorces him. He is Modou's long-time friend and a doctor. Aïssatou: Ramatoulaye's best friend, to whom the letter is addressed. She divorced Mawdo because she did not believe in polygamy; she left him a letter explaining her actions and never returned. She takes care of herself well and bought Ramatoulaye a car, which made life much easier for Ramatoulaye. Her divorce is symbolic because it represents a new life for her. She later leaves Senegal with her four sons and moves to the United States to start over. She succeeds in making a new life for herself. Aïssatou: Ramatoulaye and Moudo's daughter, named after her best friend, the recipient of the "" Long Letter"". She enters into a relationship with a boy she calls ""Iba,"" a poor student who impregnates her. They claim to love each other and plan their marriage after their studies. Since she is still a high school student, Iba's mother will take care of the child until she graduates.  Ibrahima Sall: A student of law who impregnates Aissatou, Ramatoulaye's daughter. He is tall, respectful, well-dressed, and punctual. Aïssatou is his first and possibly only love, he says. He will marry Aïssatou if Ramatoulaye will allow it. Binetou: A young girl around Daba's age who marries her 'sugar daddy' (Modou) because her mother, who was poor, wanted to live the high life and climb the social ladder. Binetou became an outcast who never quite fit in with the younger couples or the mature adults. Daouda Dieng: Proposes to Ramatoulaya after her husband takes a second wife, but is turned down. Daba: Ramatoulaye's and Modou's daughter. She is married and the eldest child. She is disgusted by her father's choice to take a second wife.  Arame, Yacine, and Dieynaba: Known as ""the trio."" They are Ramatoulaye's daughters. They smoke, drink, party, and wear pants instead of lady-like dresses. They represent the next modernized generation after liberation from France. Alioune and Malick: Ramatoulaye's young boys who play ball in the streets because they claim to have no space to play in a compound. They get hit by a motorcyclist that they drag home with the intention of having their mother avenge them. They are disappointed to find that Ramatoulaye does not get mad at the cyclist, but at the boys because they were careless to play in the streets. This shows Ramatoulaye's wisdom in raising her children in the right way. Ousmane and Oumar: Young sons of Ramatoulaye. They represent the idea that a father figure would be beneficial for Ramatoulaye's children since several of them are still so young. This does not, however, convince Ramatoulaye to marry Daouda Dieng.  Farmata: The griot woman who is Ramatoulaye's neighbor and childhood friend. She noses into Ramatoulaye's business and is the one to point out Aissatou's pregnancy to Ramatoulaye. She represents a 'Spirit of Wisdom', but doesn't always give the best advice.  Jaqueline Diack: Mother of Mawdo's child. She contrasts Ramatoulaye character because she commits to Islamic religion and becomes Mawdo's third wife. Little Nabou: Raised by Mawdo's mother, Grande Nabou. She is brought up under very traditional Muslim customs and becomes a midwife. She later marries Mawdo Bâ to be his second wife. She is the niece of Grande Nabou and the first cousin of Mawdo Bâ.  Grande Nabou: Mawdo Bâ's mother and influences him to marry Little Nabou. She dislikes Aïssatou since she comes from a working-class family and her father is a jewelry maker. Grande Nabou is a princess from a royal family in Senegal and is very conservative in her views and traditions. "
wikipedia-1303862," Logopolis  Logopolis is the seventh and final serial of the 18th season in the British science fiction television series ""Doctor Who"", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 28 February to 21 March 1981. It was Tom Baker's last story as the Fourth Doctor and marks the first appearance of Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor. This serial also marks the first appearance of Janet Fielding as new companion Tegan Jovanka, whilst Nyssa, played by Sarah Sutton and seen in previous serial ""The Keeper of Traken"", returns and also joins the Doctor as a companion. Plot. Warned of upcoming danger by the TARDIS' Cloister Bell, the Doctor decides to stay out of trouble, and instead spends time fixing his broken chameleon circuit by extracting the measurements of a true police box on Earth in order to give to the mathematicians of the planet Logopolis. He is unaware that the Master is aware of his plan, and materialises his own TARDIS in a recursive loop with the Doctor's. The Doctor and Adric work out the recursion, and attempt to flush the Master out by materialising the TARDIS in the River Thames, but instead land on a boat on the river with no sign of the Master's TARDIS. Outside, the Doctor sees a glowing white figure, the Watcher, who directs him to hurry to Logopolis. In flight, they discover they have picked up a passenger, Tegan Jovanka, an airline stewardess who wandered into the TARDIS to call for help to fix her aunt's flat tyre; the Doctor informs her the Master has killed her aunt with his Tissue Compression Eliminator. On Logopolis, where the mathematicians perform their block-transfer calculations by chant-like verbal communication, the Doctor gives the lead mathematician, the Monitor, the new dimensions for the TARDIS. Discovering the calculation result to be flawed, the Doctor discovers the Master's handiwork in the death of several mathematicians. Returning to the Monitor, the Doctor finds the Master, who through mind-control of Nyssa (who believes him to be her father) is holding the Monitor hostage. The Master demands to know the secret behind Logopolis' science and the purpose of an exact replica of a space telescope from the Pharos Project on Earth, using a device to temporarily silence the mathematicians. The Monitor is horrified to find that even when the Master disables the device, the mathematicians have gone silent, and they discover that Logopolis is being overrun by entropy and turning to dust. The Monitor reveals that their calculations were used to model Charged Vacuum Emboitments (CVEs) as a means of excising off excess entropy from this universe into others as to stave off the imminent heat death of the universe; without the calculations, the CVEs have disappeared. Before the Monitor turns to dust, he reveals that a program contained in the bubble memory of their computers may be able to restore one CVE. The Doctor and Master agree to work together to return to Earth and use the Pharos Project there. Meanwhile, Nyssa, after having been freed of the Master's control and Adric are abducted aboard the Doctor's TARDIS by the Watcher and taken far outside of the galaxy, where they observe a large section of the universe including the Traken Union consumed by entropy. They manage to reset the controls for Earth, locking in on the Master's TARDIS when it arrives. While the Doctor's companions set to distract the guards, the Doctor and Master make their way to the control room and successfully execute the CVE program. However, the Master reveals he plans to hold the universe hostage, threatening to stop the program. The Doctor is forced to climb onto the telescope's dish and disconnect a power cable while the Master attempts to turn it to knock the Doctor off. While the Doctor is successful in ending the Master's threat, he hangs precariously from the dish and sees images of his various enemies before he falls to the ground. The Doctor's companions rush to the spot where he has fallen. Dying, the Doctor experiences visions of the companions that have accompanied his current form and observes, ""It's the end... but the moment has been prepared for."" They turn to see the Watcher approach, and as he does so he merges with the Doctor. Nyssa realises that the Watcher was the Doctor all the time. As the companions look on, the Fourth Doctor regenerates into a new, younger body – the Fifth Doctor. Continuity. This story continues a loose arc of three serials featuring the Master. The trilogy began with ""The Keeper of Traken"" (1981) and concludes in ""Castrovalva"" (1982). Although the Master does not appear until Part Three, his laughter can be heard in the first two episodes and Anthony Ainley is credited accordingly. The story also concludes a long thread over the preceding season, discussing entropy. In particular, ""Logopolis"" serves as punctuation to the overarching events of the earlier ""E-Space Trilogy"". Several elements of this story carry over into ""Castrovalva"", such as the theme of recursion. The Doctor and Adric look at Romana's now deserted room in the TARDIS and talk about her recent departure in ""Warriors' Gate"". The Doctor eventually jettisons her room to escape the pull of the Master's TARDIS. Before the Doctor falls from the dish, the enemies that mock him are the Master (as seen in ""The Deadly Assassin""), a Dalek (""Destiny of the Daleks""), the Pirate Captain (""The Pirate Planet""), the Cyberleader (""Revenge of the Cybermen""), Davros (""Genesis of the Daleks""), a Sontaran (""The Invasion of Time""), a Zygon (""Terror of the Zygons"") and the Black Guardian (""The Armageddon Factor""). After falling, as the Doctor lies sprawled on the ground, he sees visions of all the companions that previously accompanied his fourth incarnation: Sarah Jane Smith (""Terror of the Zygons""), Harry Sullivan (""The Sontaran Experiment""), Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (""Invasion of the Dinosaurs"", a Third Doctor story), Leela (""The Robots of Death""), K-9 (""The Armageddon Factor""), Romana I (""The Stones of Blood"") and Romana II (""Full Circle""). As pointed out in ""About Time 5"", by Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood, this serial has arguably the largest number of deaths of any ""Doctor Who"" story—albeit mostly off-camera, as the destruction of Logopolis apparently causes a significant portion of the entire universe to be swallowed by a wave of entropy. At the very least, the Traken Union is destroyed, which would put the death toll in the billions and making the Master a mass murderer of unprecedented proportions, albeit one caused incidentally. The spin-off BBC Books novel ""The Quantum Archangel"" by Craig Hinton briefly shows an alternate timeline where the destruction of Logopolis did result in the death of the universe. The Doctor Who Unbound audio play ""He Jests at Scars..."" depicts a timeline in which the Valeyard attempts to undo the events of this story by destroying Logopolis before the Fourth Doctor visited it. This story features the Doctor's TARDIS materialising around the Master's TARDIS, something which occurred once before in ""The Time Monster"". The Master suggests that the Time Lords will not approve of the Doctor's alliance with him and will cut all ties to him, yet this is never mentioned in any of the Doctor's later dealings with them. The DVD information text suggests that this is Christopher Bidmead's attempt to write the Time Lords (and the series' increasingly complex backstory) out of the series altogether, but it was never carried through in later series. The projection of the Doctor's future incarnation (in the form of the Watcher) is similar to the future projection of his mentor K’anpo Rinpoche (in the form of Cho-Je) in the Doctor's previous regeneration story, ""Planet of the Spiders"". A similar Watcher is present in the Fifth Doctor's mindscape in the Winter segment of the Big Finish audio play, ""Circular Time"". Production. The location scenes at the Pharos Project were filmed at a BBC receiving station in Crowsley Park, with a model standing in for the radio telescope and not the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. The lay-by seen at the start was filmed on the southbound side of the A413 Amersham Road, Denham near Gerrards Cross. The lay-by is still there but the M25 now bridges the road where the scene was filmed. Titles. The closing titles sequence was recompiled with Tom Baker's face removed from the closing credits of Episode 4, and with Peter Davison's face added for the following story, ""Castrovalva"". Episode 4 of this story was the last time, for the next 24 years, the lead character was listed in the credits as ""Doctor Who"" (thus making it the only time Peter Davison was credited as ""Doctor Who""). Beginning with the next story, ""Castrovalva"", until the series' cancellation in 1989, the character was credited simply as ""The Doctor"". The 1996 television film did not have an on-screen credit for the Eighth Doctor, but listed the Seventh as the ""Old Doctor"". The 2005 relaunch returned the credit to ""Doctor Who"", and then again to ""The Doctor"" in ""The Christmas Invasion"" (at the request of David Tennant). Also, Episode 4 was the first to credit two actors as ""Doctor Who"" or ""The Doctor"" when a regeneration scene was involved. It also happened at the end of Episode 4 of ""The Caves of Androzani"". In both instances, Peter Davison was billed second. Outside references. According to Christopher Bidmead, the Logopolitans employ a hexadecimal, or base-16, numerical system, a real system commonly used in computer programming. When Adric and the Monitor read strings of numbers and letters, the letters are actually the numbers between 10 and 15, expressed as single digits. The Police Box that the Doctor materialises the TARDIS around in Part One was intended to be the one located at the Barnet bypass, which at the time was one of the last police boxes in the Metropolitan Police District still in its original location, though it had ceased functioning in the 1970s. It was removed in 1981 prior to the filming of this story. In print. A novelisation of this serial, written by Christopher H. Bidmead, was published by Target Books in October 1982. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by Bidmead was released by BBC Audiobooks in February 2010, with a completely new cover. Broadcast VHS and DVD releases. ""Logopolis"" was repeated on BBC2 in November/December 1981, as part of ""The Five Faces of Doctor Who"". The story was released on VHS in March 1992. In January 2007, the serial was released on DVD as part of a trilogy, entitled ""New Beginnings"", alongside ""The Keeper of Traken"" and ""Castrovalva"". ""Logopolis"" was also released as part of Issue 46 of the Doctor Who DVD Files, published 6 October 2010. "

He later studied at the Leeds College of Art and received a qualification in graphic design. Before making his major television breakthrough, he was discovered and encouraged by television presenter Davina McCall, performing in-role stand up comedy in a Southern comedy club.  McCall landed Francis his first television role on ""Dom and Kirk's Nite O Plenty"", where he portrayed Bobby Stark, a man who gives tips on how to win over the ladies. The series aired on Paramount Television from January to July 1996. Francis' second television role was as Barry Gibson, a music paparazzo, featured on the early series of Channel 4's ""Popworld"".

Francis lives in London, and on 30 October 2002, at Allerton Castle, North Yorkshire, he married Jill Carter, a beauty therapist. Their daughter, Matilda, was born in February 2009. Career. In his early career, Francis did a series of shorts for Paramount Comedy called ""stars in Their houses. Some of"" the shorts can be found on YouTube. His major television breakthrough occurred when Channel 4 offered him a £250,000 deal to produce a series based around his portrayal of television characters, such as his previous roles as Bobby Stark and Barry Gibson, and in 2002, ""Bo' Selecta!"" was born. The series featured Francis portraying a series of celebrities by wearing face masks to impersonate them, as well as portraying the main, non-celebrity character, Avid Merrion. The programme lasted for five series, airing between 2002 and 2006, however, the last two series were only loosely based on the original three. Season 4 was subtitled ""A Bear's Tail"", and was based around another of his characters, ""The Bear"". Season 5 returned to Avid Merrion and was called ""Bo! in the USA"". Following the axing of ""Bo' Selecta!"", Francis took one of the series characters, Keith Lemon, and created a brand new show, ""Keith Lemon's Very Brilliant World Tour"", which aired on ITV2 in April 2008. The show was a success, and subsequently, Francis created another new show featuring Lemon, ""Celebrity Juice"", which has aired nine series to date. Lemon also co-hosted ""Sing If You Can"" with Stacey Solomon, and since 7 April 2012 he has hosted his new show ""Keith Lemon's LemonAid"" on ITV. In November 2011, it was revealed that Lemon would make his feature film debut in """", with production starting later that month. Since 2013, he has presented ""Through the Keyhole"" in character as Keith Lemon. Characterisation. Francis is known to conduct almost every interview in one of his celebrity guises, being interviewed as Avid Merrion during ""Bo' Selecta's"" run between 2002 and 2006, and as Keith Lemon ever since. In an interview given in an episode of ""Comedy Map of Britain"", Francis, for the first time out-of-character, claimed that Avid Merrion's accent and dialects were inspired by his former teacher at the Leeds College of Art, Laimonis Mierins (12 March 1929 Parish of the Tukums District of Latvia - 21 December 2011 UK). He also pointed out that Merrion is a misspelling of Mierins and has nothing to do with the Merrion Centre in Leeds, which many people assume. Francis conducted further interviews as himself for ""The Frank Skinner Show"", ""Loose Women"", ""Big Brother's Little Brother"" and ""Friday Night with Jonathan Ross"". Francis stars in ""Lemon La Vida Loca"", where he portrays Keith Lemon again. "

wikipedia-1303873," Quick kick  In American football and Canadian football, a quick kick is any punt made under conditions such that the opposing team ""should not"" expect a punt. Typically this has been a kick from scrimmage from a formation that is, or resembles, one usually used other than for punting, or at least not resembling the one usually used for punting. Typically it will also be on some down before last down (last down being 3rd in Canadian, and, since 1912, 4th in American football), unless done from a formation usually used for place kicking; if opponents begin to anticipate quick kick on next-to-last down, then it may be done on a previous down. Purpose. The purpose of a quick kick is the same as that for all punting, but with additional hope of: Disadvantages. The disadvantages (required for the punt to be unexpected) are one or more of these: Occurrence. Factors that make a quick kick more likely: If a team uses the quick kick a lot, surprise can be maintained only by their also having a fake quick kick play. One type of such play is the equivalent of the Statue of Liberty play for the forward pass: the ostensible punter holds the ball out as if to drop it, then hands it to a teammate stepping behind or in front of him. The quick kick is usually done from closer to the line of scrimmage than an ordinary punt. For approximately the decade of the 1910s in American football, the rules discouraged the quick kick by requiring that the ball be kicked from at least 5 yards behind one's line of scrimmage. Because of the closeness of the opposing team, the approach the kicker uses before dropping the ball for a quick kick is often designed to decrease the distance forward that the punter will step, and/or to reduce the time of the approach. One such technique is the ""rocker step"", in which the punter first steps backward and then rocks forward. Another is to take a somewhat sideways approach, leaning and kicking somewhat ""across the body""; for a right-footed kicker this means approaching toward the right while leaning left. A quick kick made relatively close to the opposing goal line is often executed by a technique called a ""pooch punt"", which is a more controlled kick. A typical last down punt or a punt taken as a free kick is done with the emphasis mostly on maximizing distance. Frequency. Quick kicks are relatively rare in American football, but they have never completely disappeared. Quarterback Randall Cunningham made 20 quick kicks during his career. Bear Bryant was known to have used this on third downs when up big or as Pat Trammell once said ""I wanted to see how our defense could do"". Another, more recent example is that of Kellen Moore of Boise State University against Louisiana Tech on October 26, 2010, when Moore delivered a 54-yard punt. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady performed a quick kick punt on 3rd & 10 in the final quarter of a blowout against the Denver Broncos, in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, on January 14th, 2012.

wikipedia-1303910," 1890 Manifesto  The ""1890 Manifesto"", sometimes simply called ""The Manifesto"", is a statement which officially advised against any future plural marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Issued by church president Wilford Woodruff in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the United States Congress, which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, escheated its assets to the U.S. federal government, and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as ""authoritative and binding"". The Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised against church members from entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early 1900s. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church Standard Works as Official Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation, in which Wilford Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Mormon fundamentalists dispute that Woodruff received any such revelation. Background. The Manifesto was issued in response to the anti-polygamy policies of the federal government of the United States, and most especially the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887. This law disincorporated the LDS Church and authorized the federal government to seize all of the church’s assets. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Edmunds–Tucker Act in ""Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States"" in May 1890. In April 1889, Woodruff, then president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, ""we mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it."" Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing. In February 1890, the Supreme Court had already ruled in ""Davis v. Beason"" that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change Utah Territory would be granted statehood. Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage. The following morning, he reported this to some of the general authorities and placed the hand-written draft on a table. George Reynolds would later recount that he, Charles W. Penrose, and John R. Winder modified Woodruff's draft into the current language accepted by the general authorities and presented to the church as a whole. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned ""Deseret Weekly"" in Salt Lake City. On October 6, 1890, during the 60th Semiannual General Conference of the church, the Manifesto was formally accepted by the church membership. When Utah applied for statehood again, it was granted on January 4, 1896. One of the conditions for granting Utah and other western territories statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution. The Manifesto. The Manifesto, issued by Wilford Woodruff, states: Formal acceptance by the LDS Church. ""President Lorenzo Snow offered the following: ""The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous. ""Salt Lake City, Utah, October 6, 1890."" New plural marriages vs. existing plural marriages. The Manifesto was the end of official church authorization for the creation of new plural marriages that violated local laws. It had no effect on the status of already existing plural marriages, and plural marriages continued to be performed in locations where it was believed to be legal. As Woodruff explained at the general conference where the Manifesto was accepted by the church, ""his Manifesto only refers to future marriages, and does not affect past conditions. I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor."" Despite Woodruff's explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife. However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the Edmunds–Tucker Act. Aftermath and post-Manifesto plural marriage. Within six years of the announcement of the Manifesto, Utah had become a state and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided. However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B. H. Roberts. D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto ""officially ceased"" the practice of plural marriage in the church, ""the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual."" Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and began to be examined by Congress in the Reed Smoot hearings. In response, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a ""Second Manifesto"" in 1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into or solemnize new plural marriages. Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church’s position on plural marriage. Plural marriage in violation of local law continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church. The gradual cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement. Evolution of Latter-day Saint views on the Manifesto. The Manifesto has been canonized by the LDS Church, and its text appears in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the church's books of scripture. However, when the Manifesto was issued, it was not apparent that Woodruff or the other leaders of the LDS Church viewed it as the result of a divine revelation. Approximately one year after he declared the Manifesto, Woodruff began to claim that he had received instructions from Jesus Christ that formed the basis of what he wrote in the text of the Manifesto. These instructions were reportedly accompanied by a vision of what would occur if the Manifesto were not issued. Following Woodruff's death in 1898, other church leaders began to teach that the Manifesto was the result of a revelation of God. Since that time, church leaders have consistently taught that the Manifesto was inspired of God. In 1908, the Manifesto was printed in the LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants for the first time, and it has been included in every edition since. A non-Mormon observer of the church has stated that ""is no question that, from a doctrinal standpoint, President Woodruff's Manifesto now has comparable status with [Joseph Smith's revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants"". The Manifesto is currently published as ""Official Declaration 1"" in the Doctrine and Covenants. "
wikipedia-1303931," North Jersey Coast Line  The North Jersey Coast Line is a New Jersey Transit commuter rail service between New York Penn Station or Hoboken Terminal and Bay Head, New Jersey, electrified as far as Long Branch. On rail system maps it is colored light blue, and its symbol is a sailboat. Most trains operate between New York Penn Station and Long Branch with frequent rush-hour service and hourly local off-peak service. Diesel shuttle trains between Long Branch and Bay Head meet these electric trains. Hourly New York to Long Branch service operates on weekends, with bi-hourly diesel shuttle service (with some extra trains) between Long Branch and Bay Head. Full hourly service operates during the peak summer season. During weekdays, five round trip diesel trains have run from Bay Head to Hoboken Terminal using the Waterfront Connection since September 9, 1991. Passengers can reach New York via the Northeast Corridor Line at Newark, or PATH at Newark or Hoboken. Some electric trains terminate at South Amboy or Aberdeen-Matawan and make all stops from New York Penn Station, providing local service for the Northeast Corridor stops of Rahway, Linden, Elizabeth, and North Elizabeth during rush hours. Physical characteristics. The line is double track except for the bridge over the Manasquan River at Brielle. The line has cab signals and wayside block signals; the line from Rahway to Long Branch is signaled for operation in either direction on both tracks (NORAC Rule 261). Twelve interlockings facilitate flexibility in operation between the two tracks; these and other interlockings control movements to or from freight lines such as the Chemical Coast Secondary, the Perth Amboy Secondary, and the Monmouth Secondary, as well as Long Branch Yard. Passenger yards are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard is fully electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head contains a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating the need for a turntable. It remains in service, even though push-pull operation has eliminated the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are hand-operated. A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating back to when electrification ended there, but have been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy can be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform. Movable bridges. The North Jersey Coast Line has five movable bridges of the twelve used by the NJT rail network, the most on any one line. River Draw is a swing bridge at Raritan Bay. Other draw spans cross the Cheesequake or Morgan Creek (bascule), Oceanport over the Shrewsbury River (swing, with non-movable catenary), Shark River (bascule) and Manasquan River (bascule). All these bridges are double-track spans, but the Manasquan bridge has been single-tracked since the mid-1970s. The line also crosses over several other waterways on fixed bridges, the longest of which is over the Navesink River at Red Bank. Electrification. The North Jersey Coast Line is electrified north (railroad east) of Long Branch. Electrified operation between Rahway and South Amboy began about 1936; the catenary poles from the junction in Rahway to South Amboy are the Pennsylvania Railroad design used on their 1930s projects. Electrification was extended to Matawan in 1982, with catenary installed in the early 1980s. This was originally 11 kV, increased to 12 kV in 1978 along with Amtrak's New York-Washington electrification, with insulators capable of supporting 25 kV. Electrification at 12.5 kV 60 Hz was extended to Long Branch in 1988, with catenary installed in 1986–88. As on the 1982 extension the insulators can handle 25 kV. The catenary is self-adjusting (constant tensioning) with ambient temperature. In 2002 the voltage from Matawan to Long Branch was changed from 12.5 kV to 25 kV. As a result the Arrow III passenger cars can no longer run between those two points, since those trains can not run on two different voltages on one trip (the transformer voltage taps must be manually changed from alongside the MU). The line remains electrified at 12 kV 25 Hz AC north of Matawan. Three phase breaks segregate the different power sources, at the Morgan Creek Drawbridge, Laurel(Hazlet/Holmdel), and east of Bergen Place in Red Bank. As of January 2010, NJ Transit Customer Service says there are no plans to extend the electrification south of Long Branch. Commuter Clubs. The line is also home to the last remaining private commuter passenger Club in the United States. The Jersey Shore Commuters Club was established in 1933 under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Currently it has use of half of a Comet IIM car - car #5459. In 2004, the Club Car went through a custom overhaul and was furnished, with the Club's own money, to include reclining lounge chairs, spacious seating, at-seat fold down tables, and private conference tables. The Club also hosts various onboard activities to preserve its heritage. Club members enjoy guaranteed and spacious seating as part of their annual membership fee that the Club remits to New Jersey Transit as part of its lease agreement. Membership is ""open"" and on a ""first come first served basis"" to those willing to pay the membership fee and abide by the Club's bylaws. The Club end of the car is furnished similar to Amtrak's Amfleet and Horizon fleet of cars. The Club Car seats are actually former Amfleet Metroliner seats that the Club recently re-conditioned. The Club Car only runs during peak rush hour periods and is always run with the club end coupled to the locomotive when used. Rolling stock. The Coast Line has among the most diverse selection of fleet in the NJT system. Hurricane Sandy. As a line paralleling the New Jersey coastline, the North Jersey Coast Line received exceptionally severe damage from Hurricane Sandy on October 29–30, 2012. Track was washed out in several places from Perth Amboy southward, most notably between South Amboy and Aberdeen-Matawan stations, where the line runs closest to the Atlantic Ocean. The Raritan Bay and Morgan Creek drawbridges were struck by boats, storage containers and other floating debris, knocking the bridges' tracks out of alignment. Trees also fell over parts of the line. Service remained suspended for three weeks; a resumption of service only as far as Woodbridge (and skipping Avenel) on November 4 was halted after only one day due to severe overcrowding. The Christie Administration announced that most North Jersey Coast Line trains would return to service on Monday, November 19, with slightly longer trip times and omission of trains to Hoboken Terminal. Station listing. See Northeast Corridor Line for stations between New York/Hoboken and Rahway. Mileage for Rahway, Avenel and Woodbridge is measured from Milepost 1 at Exchange Place, the former PRR terminal in Jersey City, while the mileage for Perth Amboy is measured from the former CNJ Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City. The NJCL mileage resets to 0 at the north end of the Raritan Bay bridge at Perth Amboy; the total distance from where the Coast Line splits off the Northeast Corridor to the Raritan bridge is 6.7 miles.

wikipedia-1303937," Bat-Mite  Bat-Mite is a fictional character appearing in stories published by DC Comics. The character made his first appearance in ""Detective Comics"" #267 (May 1959) in a story titled ""Batman Meets Bat-Mite"" written by Bill Finger, with art by Sheldon Moldoff. Bat-Mite is an Imp similar to the Superman villain Mister Mxyzptlk. Appearing as a small childlike man in an ill-fitting costume, Bat-Mite possesses what appears to be near-infinite magical power, but in reality is highly-advanced technology from the fifth dimension that cannot be understood by our limited three-dimensional views. Unlike Mxyzptlk, Bat-Mite idolizes his superhero target and thus he has visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange events so that he could see his hero in action. Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a supervillain, and often departs of his own accord upon realizing that he has angered his idol. Fictional character history. Pre-Crisis. Bat-Mite regularly appeared in ""Batman"", ""Detective Comics"", and ""World's Finest Comics"" for five years. Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of ""World's Finest Comics"" to plague Superman and Batman together, as well. In 1964, however, when the Batman titles were revamped under new editor Julius Schwartz, Bat-Mite vanished along with the other extraneous members of the Batman family such as Ace the Bat-Hound. After this, only three more Bat-Mite stories were published in the pre-""Crisis"" DC Universe: two Bat-Mite/Mr. Mxyzptlk team ups in ""World's Finest Comics"" #152 (August 1965) and #169 (September 1967) (which were not edited by Schwartz but by Mort Weisinger), and ""Bat-Mite's New York Adventure"" from ""Detective Comics"" #482 (February–March 1979), in which the imp visits the DC Comics offices and insists that he be given his own feature in a Batman comic. This story featured protestors with picket signs shouting ""We want Bat-Mite!"" outside the Tishman Building (where DC's editorial offices were located at the time), and was accompanied by an editorial comment that this story was published specifically to acknowledge the actual requests of fans for this character's revival. Later Bat-Mite appeared in a one-page story in the 200th issue of ""The Brave and the Bold"". Post-Crisis. After the continuity-changing 1985 limited series ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" was published, Bat-Mite was mostly removed from the Batman comics canon. Bat-Mite made an appearance in the series ""Legends of the Dark Knight"", although he may have been the hallucination of a drug-addled criminal named Bob Overdog. This comic states that Bat-Mite is one of the many admirers of superheroes from another dimension. This version of Bat-Mite later appeared in ""Mitefall"", a one-shot book which was a parody of the """" Batman storyline (with Overdog in the Jean-Paul Valley role). In #6 of the 1999 ""World's Finest"" miniseries, Mr. Mxyzptlk encountered Bat-Mite, shortly after being mistaken for him by Overdog. While in this story the post-""Crisis"" Bat-Mite encountered Batman for the first time, Superman and Batman subsequently concluded that Mxyzptlk had created him, inspired by Overdog's ravings. Bat-Mite also appeared in the 2000 one-shot Elseworlds comic special ', in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the pre-""Crisis"" multiverse and the post-""Crisis"" DC Universe, as well as the Elseworlds of ""Kingdom Come"", ', and the DC animated universe. As an Elseworlds story itself, ""World's Funnest"" has no impact on continuity, as inferred from Dark Knight Returns and Kingdom Come being introduced to the official DC multiverse as a result of the series ""52"".  Apart from ""World's Funnest"", there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. In the ""Bizarro Comics"" anthology, Mxyzptlk's native 5th Dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite and Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt. Neither of these comics are considered canonical; however, in a JLA/JSA crossover in ""JLA"" and in ""JSA"" #78–80 it was revealed that both Mxyzptlk and Thunderbolt come from the 5th Dimension. Letter columns and writer interviews suggest that Bat-Mite comes from there as well, although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves.  In the post-""Crisis"" issue ""Superman/Batman"" #25, it was revealed that the Joker had gained Fifth Dimensional powers by maintaining the essence of Mr. Mxyzptlk from the earlier ""Emperor Joker"" storyline; at the end, Bizarro was able to extract this latent magical essence from the Joker, which manifested in a form recognizable as Bat-Mite. As such, a Bat-Mite has been fully reestablished into the current continuity as an outgrowth of Mr. Mxyzptlk incubated within the Joker. The first post-""Infinite Crisis"" appearance of Bat-Mite was in ""Batman"" #672, written by Grant Morrison. Batman is confronted with Bat-Mite (or ""Might"") after being shot in the chest and suffering a heart attack. Might, who bears a green insectoid creature on his back, claims to have come from ""Space B at the Fivefold Expansion of Zrfff"" (At times Zrfff has been used as the name of Mr. Mxyzptlk's home dimension). Only Batman sees him. As Batman is having an increasingly difficult time keeping his grip on reality during this period, it is possible that Mite is a mental delusion.  In ""Batman"" #678, Might reappears at the last page, commenting, ""uh-oh"" to Batman's increasing delusions. He then, throughout the whole ""Batman R.I.P."" series, appears to counsel the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, a delusional personality manufactured by Bruce himself to keep Batman able to fight in case he was mindwiped, or driven to insanity. ""Batman"" #680 reveals that Might is indeed a product of Batman's imagination and represents the last vestiges of Batman's rational mind within the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, although when asked by Batman whether he is an extra-dimensional being or a figment of his imagination, Bat-Mite responds that the fifth dimension ""is"" imagination. In ""Superman/Batman"" #52, Bat-Mite appears having had a bet with Mr. Mxyzptlk similar to that of ""World's Funnest"". This Bat-Mite appears to admire Batman, and Batman addresses him with familiarity. In other media. Television. Bat-Mite was a regular character of the 1977 Filmation animated series ""The New Adventures of Batman"" voiced by Lou Scheimer. He was depicted as a well-meaning magical fan of the superhero. As such, he tried to help Batman even though he usually complicated matters, with a whiny ""All I wanna do is help!"" as a near-catchphrase. One episode featured his home planet called Ergo as well as a villain of Bat-Mite's species named Zarbor. He also has a crush on Batgirl. An animatronic Bat-Mite briefly appeared in the """" episode ""Deep Freeze"", voiced by Pat Fraley. Bat-Mite enthusiastically greeted Batman, saying ""Greetings, Dynamic Duo! I'm your biggest fan!"" before kissing Robin, who was shocked. It then malfunctions and falls apart, stuttering ""I just wanna help!"". It is revealed just to be a robot toy, created by robotics expert Karl Rossum (voiced by William Sanderson). In the background, an animatronic Mister Mxyzptlk, Streaky the Supercat and Krypto the Superdog can also be seen in Rossum's apartment. Bat-Mite also appeared in the """" episodes ""Legends of the Dark Mite"", ""Emperor Joker"", ""Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!"" and the series finale, ""Mitefall!"", voiced by Paul Reubens. This version of Bat-Mite is powerful enough to regularly break the fourth wall and read to Batman his past, present and future exploits from real world comic books, and make fun of real-world comic convention fans.

wikipedia-1303939," Walt Disney Animation Studios  Walt Disney Animation Studios, headquartered in Burbank, California, and formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation, Walt Disney Productions and Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, is an American animation studio which creates animated feature films, short films and television specials for The Walt Disney Company. Founded on October 16, 1923, it is a unit of The Walt Disney Studios. The studio has produced 52 feature films, beginning with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), with its most recent being ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (2012). Originally founded as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio and later incorporated as Walt Disney Productions in 1929, the studio was exclusively dedicated to production of short films until expanding into feature production in 1934. During The Walt Disney Company's corporate restructuring in 1986, the studio officially became a subsidiary of the company under the name Walt Disney Feature Animation. It took on its current name in 2006, when it was folded under The Walt Disney Studios alongside Pixar Animation Studios, which was acquired by Disney in the same year. For much of its existence, the studio was recognized as the premier American animation studio, and developed many of the techniques which became standard practices of traditional animation. The studio's catalog of animated features are among Disney's most notable assets, and the stars of its animated shorts—Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto—have gone on to become recognizable figures in popular culture, as well as becoming mascots for The Walt Disney Company as a whole. Walt Disney Animation Studios, today managed by Pixar heads Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter, continues to produce animated features using both hand-drawn and computer generated imagery techniques. Their 53rd feature, ""Frozen"", is currently in post-production and set for release on November 27, 2013. Their 54th, ""Big Hero 6"", is currently in development and set for release on November 7, 2014. History. 1920s: Foundation and early years. Kansas City, Missouri natives Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in Los Angeles in 1923, producing a series of silent ""Alice Comedies"" short films featuring a live-action child actress in an animated world. The ""Alice Comedies"" were distributed by Margaret J. Winkler's Winkler Pictures, which later also distributed a second Disney short subject series, the all-animated ""Oswald the Lucky Rabbit"", through Universal Pictures starting in 1927. The Disney studio was set up in storefront offices on Kingswell Avenue in downtown Los Angeles until early 1926, when it moved to a new building built for the company on a lot at 2719 Hyperion Avenue. After the first year's worth of ""Oswald""s, Walt Disney attempted to renew his contract with Winkler Pictures, but Charles Mintz, who had taken over Margaret Winkler's business after marrying her, wanted to force Disney to accept a lower advance payment for each ""Oswald"" short. Disney refused, and as Universal owned the rights to ""Oswald"" rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce ""Oswald"" cartoons. Most of Disney's staff was hired away by Mintz to move over once Disney's ""Oswald"" contract was done in mid-1928. Working in secret while the rest of the staff finished the remaining ""Oswalds"" on contract, Disney and his head animator Ub Iwerks led a small handful of loyal staffers in producing cartoons starring a new character named Mickey Mouse. The first two ""Mickey Mouse"" cartoons, ""Plane Crazy"" and ""The Galloping Gaucho"", made only mild impressions when previewed in limited engagements during the summer of 1928. For the third ""Mickey"" cartoon, however, Disney produced a sound track, collaborating with musician Carl Stalling and businessman Pat Powers, who provided Disney with his bootlegged ""Cinephone"" sound-on-film process. Subsequently, the third ""Mickey Mouse"" cartoon, ""Steamboat Willie"", became Disney's first cartoon with synchronized sound, and was a major success upon its November 1928 debut at the West 57th Theatre in New York City. The ""Mickey Mouse"" series of sound cartoons, distributed by Powers through Celebrity Productions, quickly became the most popular cartoon series in the United States. A second Disney series of sound cartoons, the ""Silly Symphonies"", debuted in 1929 with ""The Skeleton Dance"". Each ""Silly Symphony"" was a one-shot cartoon centered around music or a particular theme. 1930s: ""Silly Symphonies"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". In 1930, disputes over finances between Disney and Powers led to Disney's studio, reincorporated on December 16, 1929 as Walt Disney Productions, signing a new distribution contract with Columbia Pictures. Powers in return signed away Ub Iwerks, who began producing cartoons at his own studio. Columbia distributed Disney's shorts for two years before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process. The result was the ""Silly Symphony"" ""Flowers and Trees"", the first full-color animated film. ""Flowers and Trees"" was a major success, and all ""Silly Symphonies"" were subsequently produced in Technicolor. The 1933 Technicolor ""Silly Symphony"" ""Three Little Pigs"" became a major box office and pop culture success, with its theme song ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"" becoming a popular chart hit. In 1934, Walt Disney gathered several key staff members and announced his plans to make his first feature animated film. Despite derision from most of the film industry, who dubbed the production ""Disney's Folly"", Disney proceeded undaunted into the production of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", which would become the first animated feature in English and Technicolor. Considerable training and development went into the production of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", and the studio greatly expanded with established animators, artists from other fields, and recent college graduates joining the studio to work on the film. The training classes, supervised by the head animators such as Les Clark, Norm Ferguson, and Art Babbit and taught by Donald W. Graham, an art teacher from the nearby Chouinard Art Institute, had begun at the studio in 1932 and were greatly expanded into orientation training and continuing education classes. In the course of teaching the classes, Graham and the animators created or formalized many of the techniques and processes that became the key tenants and principles of traditional animation. ""Silly Symphonies"" such as ""The Goddess of Spring"" (1934) and ""The Old Mill"" (1937) served as experimentation grounds for new techniques such as the animation of realistic human figures, special effects animation, the use of the multiplane camera, an invention which split animation artwork layers into several planes, allowing the camera to appear to move dimensionally through an animated scene. [[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|left|thumb|Walt Disney introduces each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ""Snow White"" theatrical trailer.]] ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" cost Disney a then-expensive sum of $1.4 million to complete, and was an unprecedented success when released in February 1938 by RKO Radio Pictures, which had assumed distribution of Disney product from United Artists in 1937. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was briefly the highest grossing film of all time before the success of ""Gone with the Wind"" two years later. During the production of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", work had continued on the ""Mickey Mouse"" and ""Silly Symphonies"" series of shorts. ""Mickey Mouse"" had switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the ""Donald Duck"" cartoons eclipsed the ""Mickey Mouse"" series in popularity. The ""Silly Symphonies"", which garnered seven , ended in 1939, replaced by a series of irregularly released ""Walt Disney Specials"" shorts. 1940s: New features, strike, and World War II. The success of ""Snow White"" allowed Disney to build a new, larger studio on Buena Vista Street in Burbank, where The Walt Disney Company remains headquartered to this day. Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering in 1940, with Walt Disney as president and chairman and Roy Disney as CEO. The studio launched into the production of new animated features, the first of which was ""Pinocchio"", released in February 1940. ""Pinocchio"" was not initially a box office success. The box office returns from the film's initial release were both below ""Snow White""'s unprecedented success and below studio expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million negative cost—twice the cost of ""Snow White""—Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. However, ""Pinocchio"" was a critical success, winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, making it the first film of the studio to win not only either Oscar, but both at the same time. ""Fantasia"", an experimental film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, was released in November 1940 by Disney itself (without the assistance of RKO, who declined to distribute the film) in a series of limited-searing roadshow engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce while the combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed ""Fantasia"" at an even greater loss than ""Pinocchio"". RKO assumed distribution of ""Fantasia"" in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years. Despite its financial failure, ""Fantasia"" was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942—one for the development of the innovative Fantasound system used to create the film's stereoscopic soundtrack, and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film. Much of the character animation on these productions and all subsequent features until the late 1970s was supervised by a brain-trust of animators Walt Disney dubbed the ""Nine Old Men"", many of whom also served as directors and later producers on the Disney features: Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Woolie Reitherman, Les Clark, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Milt Kahl, and Marc Davis. Other head animators at Disney during this period included Norm Ferguson, Bill Tytla, and Fred Moore. The development of the feature animation department created a caste system at the Disney studio: lesser animators (and feature animators in-between assignments) were assigned to work on the short subjects, while animators higher in status such as the Nine Old Men worked on the features. Concern over Walt Disney accepting credit for the artists' work as well as debates over compensation led to many of the newer and lower-ranked animators seeking to unionize the Disney studio. A bitter union strike resulted in mid-1941, which was resolved - without the angered Walt Disney's involvement - in Walt Disney Productions being set up as a union shop. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s. ""Dumbo"", in production during the midst of the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941, and proved to be a financial success. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, half the cost of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", less than a third of the cost of ""Pinocchio"", and certainly less than the expensive ""Fantasia"". ""Dumbo"" eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, ""Bambi"" was released, and as with ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"", did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it only grossed $1.64 million. Production of features was temporarily suspended due to World War II, after the release of ""Bambi"". Reasons for the halt in feature production included the drafting of several Disney animators, the European market was cut off by the war, and the necessity of the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the US Army, particularly military training and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. In a step to keep the studio alive, Walt Disney ordered the production of ""package films"": low-budgeted animated films composed of short subjects with bridging material. These films were ""Saludos Amigos"" (1942), ""The Three Caballeros"" (1944), ""Make Mine Music"" (1946), ""Fun and Fancy Free"" (1947), ""Melody Time"" (1948) and ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" (1949). The studio also produced two features, ""Song of the South"" (1946) and ""So Dear to My Heart"" (1948), which were a combination of animated and live-action footage. Shorts production continued during this period as well, with ""Donald Duck"", ""Goofy"", and ""Pluto"" cartoons being the main output accompanied by cartoons starring Mickey Mouse, Figaro, and, in the 1950s, Chip n' Dale and Humphrey the Bear. In addition, Disney began reissuing the previous features, beginning with re-releases of ""Snow White"" in 1944, ""Pinocchio"" in 1945, and ""Fantasia"" in 1946. This led to a tradition of reissuing the Disney films every seven years, which lasted into the 1990s before being translated into the studio's handling of home video releases 1950s: Return of features, end of shorts. In 1948, Disney returned to the production of full-length features with ""Cinderella"", a full-length film based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. At a cost of nearly $3,000,000, the future of the studio depended upon the success of this film. Upon its release in 1950, ""Cinderella"" proved to be a box office success, with the profits from the film's release allowing Disney to carry on producing animated features throughout the 1950s. Following its success, three features halted in development during World War II were resumed and completed: ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", and ""Lady and the Tramp"". In addition, an ambitious new project, an adaptation of the fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" set to Tchaikovsky's classic score, was begun but took much of the rest of the decade to complete. ""Alice in Wonderland"", released in 1951, met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. ""Peter Pan"", released in 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, ""Lady and the Tramp"" was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. ""Lady"" is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution. By the mid-1950s, with Walt Disney's attention primarily set on new endeavour such as live-action films, television, and the Disneyland theme park, production (though not final approvals) of the animated films was left primarily in the hands of the ""Nine Old Men"" trust of head animators and directors. This led to several delays in approvals during the production of Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"", which was finally released in 1959. At $6 million, it was Disney's most expensive film to date, produced in a heavily stylized art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large-format Super Technirama 70 with six-track stereophonic sound. However, the film's large production costs and underperformance at the box office resulted in the studio posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, leading to massive layoffs throughout the studio. By the end of the decade, the Disney short subjects were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions' personnel either leaving the company or begin reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" and ""Disneyland"". While the Disney shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, Warner Bros' ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Merrie Melodies"", and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style. During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"", won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar. The ""Mickey Mouse"", ""Pluto"", and ""Goofy"" shorts had all ceased regular production by 1953, with ""Donald Duck"" and ""Humphrey"" continuing and converting to widescreen CinemaScope before also begin discontinued in 1956. Disney shorts would only be produced on a sporadic basis from this point on, with notable later shorts including ""Goliath II"" (1960), ""It's Tough to Be a Bird"" (1969), ""The Small One"" (1978), ""Runaway Brain"" (1995, starring Mickey Mouse), and ""Paperman"" (2012). 1960s: Walt Disney's final years. In 1961, the studio released ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", an animated feature which popularized the use of xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels. Using xerography, animation drawings could be photo-chemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets (""cels"") used in final animation production. The resulting art style - a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators' drawings - typified Disney films into the 1980s. The film was a success, being the tenth highest grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million. The Disney animation training program started at the studio before the development of ""Snow White"" in 1932 eventually led to Walt Disney helping found the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). This university, formed via the merger of Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, included a Disney-developed animation program of study among its degree offerings. CalArts became the alma mater of many of the animators who would work at Disney and other animation studios from the 1970s to the present. ""The Sword in the Stone"" was released in 1963, and was the sixth highest grossing film of the year in North America with estimated rentals of $4.75 million. A featurette adaptation of one of A. A. Milne's ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" stories, ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree"", was released in 1966, to be followed by several other ""Pooh"" featurettes over the years and a full-length compilation feature, ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", which was released in 1977. Walt Disney died in December 1966, ten months before the studio's next film, ""The Jungle Book"", was completed and released. The film was a success, finishing 1967 as the fourth highest-grossing movie of the year. 1970s: Decline in popularity. The studio began the 1970s with the release of ""The Aristocats"", the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney himself. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who each served as both chairman and CEO in overlapping terms for the rest of the decade. The next feature, ""Robin Hood"" (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both ""The Aristocats"" and ""Robin Hood"" were minor box office and critical successes. ""The Rescuers"", released in 1977, was a success exceeding the achievements of the previous two Disney features. Receiving broad critical acclaim, commercial returns, and an Academy Award nomination; it ended up being the third highest grossing film in 1977 and the most successful Disney animated film since ""The Jungle Book"". The film was reissued in 1983, accompanied by a new Disney featurette, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"". The production of ""The Rescuers"" signaled the beginning of a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators were culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston. In 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation in the development of the art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s. 1980s: ""Rock bottom"" and recovery. Delayed half a year by the defection of the Bluth group, ""The Fox and the Hound"" was released in 1981 after four years in production. The film was considered a financial success by the studio. Ron Miller, Walt Disney's son-in-law, became president of Walt Disney Productions in 1980 and CEO in 1983. After a series of corporate takeover attempts in 1984, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. and nephew of Walt, had Miller ousted and brought in Michael Eisner as Disney's new CEO, and Frank Wells as president. Eisner in turn named Jeffrey Katzenberg chairman of the film division. Already near completion when the Eisner regime took over Disney, 1985's ""The Black Cauldron"" represented what would later be referred to as the ""rock bottom"" point for Disney animation. An expensive (the studio's most expensive to that point at $25 million) Super Technirama 70 production with a darker fantasy tone than previous Disney works, ""Cauldron"" was the first film fully in the control of the new guard of Disney artists, and was a critical and commercial failure. The film's $21 box office gross led to a loss for the studio, putting the future of the animation division in jeopardy. Between the 1950s and 1980s, the significance of animation to Disney's bottom line was significantly reduced as the company expanded into further live-action production, television, theme parks. As new CEO, Michael Eisner strongly considered shuttering the feature animation studio and outsourcing future animation. Roy E. Disney intervened, offering to head the animation division and turn its fortunes around. Named Chairman of feature animation by Eisner, Disney appointed Peter Schneider president of animation to run the day-to-day operations. In the meantime, Eisner - going against a thirty-year studio policy - created Walt Disney Television Animation to produce lower-cost content for TV. Wanting more room for live action production, Disney executives moved the animation division in 1985 from the Disney studio lot in Burbank to a set of warehouse facilities in nearby Glendale, CA. The animation studio's next feature was ""The Great Mouse Detective"", begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as ""Basil of Baker Street"" after both left the ""Black Cauldron"" production team. Released in 1986, the film was enough of a critical and commercial success to instill executive confidence in the animation studio. Later the same year, however, Universal Pictures and Steven Speilberg's Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth's ""An American Tail"", which outgrossed ""The Great Mouse Detective"" at the box office and became the highest-grossing first-issue animated film to that point. The animation department was formalized as a subsidiary of the company, officially named Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1986, and Katzenberg, Disney, and Schneider set about changing the culture of the studio, increasing staffing and production so that a new feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was ""Oliver & Company"" in 1988, which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. ""Oliver & Company"" opened in the theaters on the same day as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, ""The Land Before Time""; however, ""Oliver"" outgrossed ""Time"" and went on to become the most successful animated feature to that date. While ""Oliver & Company"" and a new feature, ""The Little Mermaid"", were in production, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and master animator Richard Williams to produce ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", a groundbreaking live action/animation hybrid directed by Robert Zemeckis which featured licensed animated characters from other animation studios. Disney set up a new animation studio under Williams' supervision in London to create the cartoon characters for ""Roger Rabbit"", with many of the artists from the California studio traveling to England to work on the film. A significant critical and commercial success, ""Roger Rabbit"" won three Academy Awards for technical achievements and was key in renewing mainstream interest in American animation. Other than the film itself, the studio also produced three Roger Rabbit shorts during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A second satellite studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, opened in 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were located within the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, and visitors were allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work. The same year, the studio released ""The Little Mermaid"", which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on ""The Great Mouse Detective"", ""Mermaid"" earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who was also a co-producer and story consultant on the film. ""Mermaid"" won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score ""Mermaid"" was also the first to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, then a small animation and software development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint techniques. ""The Little Mermaid"" was the first of a series of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term ""Disney Renaissance"". 1990s: Disney Renaissance. Accompanied in theaters by the Mickey Mouse featurette ""The Prince and the Pauper"", 1990's ""The Rescuers Down Under"", was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film to be fully colored via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of ""The Little Mermaid"". The next Disney animated feature, ""Beauty and the Beast"", had begun production in London, but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool ""Beauty"" into a musical-comedy format similar to ""Mermaid"". Alan Menken and Howard Ashaman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed. Debuting first in a work-in-progress version at the 1991 New York Film Festival before its November 1991 wide release, ""Beauty"", directed by Kirk Wise & Gary Trousdale, was an unprecedented critical and commercial success, and would later be seen as one of the studio's best films. The film earned five Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, a first for an animated work, winning for Best Song and Best Original Score. Its $150 million box office gross was record-setting, and merchandizing for the film - including toys, cross-promotions, and soundtrack sales - was also lucrative. The successes of ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty"" established the template for future Disney releases during the 1990s: a musical-comedy format with Broadway-styled songs and tentpole action sequences, buoyed by cross-promotional marketing and merchandizing designed to pull audiences of various ages and types. In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise, and Gary Torusdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris Sanders, and Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, and many others. ""Aladdin"", released in November 1992, continued the upward trend in Disney's animation success, earning $500 million worldwide at the box office, and two more Oscars for Best Song and Best Score. Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman, and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after his passing) and starring the voice of Robin Williams, ""Aladdin"" also established a new trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters, which had been explored to some degree with ""The Jungle Book"" and ""The Aristocats"" but now became standard practice. In 1994, Disney released ""The Lion King"", an all-animal adventure set in Africa featuring an all-star voice cast which included James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Jeremy Irons, and songs written by Tim Rice and pop star Elton John. ""The Lion King"" earned $768 million at the worldwide box office, to this date a record for a traditionally animated film, earning millions more in merchandizing and promotions. ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" had been the highest-grossing films worldwide in each of their respective release years. With animation becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney's business, the company began to expand its operations. The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded, and ground was broken on a new Disney Feature Animation building located on the Disney lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. The Florida satellite, officially incorporated in 1992, was expanded as well, and one of Disney's television animation studios in Paris, France - the former Brizzi Brothers studio - became Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris, where ""A Goofy Movie"" (1995) and significant parts of later Disney films were produced. Also, Disney began producing lower cost direct to video sequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television animation studios under the name ""Disney MovieToons"", later DisneyToon Studios. ""Pocahontas"" (1995) and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996) were also box-office successes, but did not do as well as the films of the early 1990s (commercially and critically). ""Pocahontas"" received Academy Awards for Best Score and Best Original Song. The studio continued producing last three animated films, 1997's ""Hercules"", 1998's ""Mulan"" and 1999's ""Tarzan"". ""Tarzan"" won an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In October 1999, Dream Quest Images, a special effects studio previously taken by The Walt Disney Company in April 1996 to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects, was merged with the computer-graphics operation of Walt Disney Feature Animation to form a division called The Secret Lab. In the same year, the division started the production of ""Dinosaur"". 2000s: Second decline in popularity and resurgence. Competition from other studios drove animator income to an all time high, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Beginning in 2000, massive layoffs brought staff numbers down to 600 employees. That same year, ""Fantasia 2000"", a sequel to 1940's ""Fantasia"", ""Dinosaur"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"", were released. ""Dinosaur"" was a box-office success, but ""Fantasia 2000"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" both had a weak financial reception. The next film from the studio, 2001's """", was not received well commercially or critically. As a result, The Secret Lab division was closed. In 2002, ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Treasure Planet"" were released. While the former was a financial success, the second was a box office failure and led to financial losses for the studio. In 2003, a reorganization of the animation units promoted by Disney resulted on Walt Disney Feature Animation being transferred to The Walt Disney Studios, and DisneyToon Studios control transferred to Walt Disney Feature Animation management. That same year, ""Brother Bear"" was released to moderate success at the box office, but received mixed-negative reception. Noting the growing success of studios that relied on computer animation like Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Blue Sky Studios, Disney, led by executive Bob Lambert, announced that it would convert Walt Disney Feature Animation into a CGI studio, performing more layoffs and selling off all of its traditional animation equipment. On January 12, 2004, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida was shut down, and was partially turned into a walk-through attraction, and into theme park management offices. On April 2, 2004, ""Home on the Range"" was released as their final traditionally animated feature, and turned out to be a box office and critical failure. In 2005, ""Chicken Little"", the first CGI film from the studio, was a moderate success in the box office, but became one of the worst received movies in the canon. In 2006, Disney acquired Pixar, and as part of the acquisition, executives Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter assumed Walt Disney Feature Animation as President and Chief Creative Officer, respectively. Under the command of Lasseter, Circle 7 Animation, a unit previously formed to create direct-to-video sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties, was shut down, and 80% of the Circle 7's employees were transferred to Feature Animation. In a change of strategy, Lasseter renamed Walt Disney Feature Animation to Walt Disney Animation Studios, and re-positioned the studio as an animation house that does both traditional and computer-animated projects. In 2007, the studio released ""Meet the Robinsons"", which obtained a cold response at the box office. DisneyToon Studios was also restructured and began to operate as a separate unit. The next film, 2008's ""Bolt"", had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since ""Lilo & Stitch"", and became a moderate success. ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first traditionally-animated film since ""Home on the Range"", was released in 2009, with a very positive critic reception and a great box office success. Also in 2009, Walt Disney Animation Studios produced the CGI ""Prep & Landing"" television special, for the self-owned over-the-air television entity, ABC. 2010s: Revitalization. With the success of ""The Princess and the Frog"", the studio continued the production of a new fairy tale film, a CGI adaptation of the Brothers Grimm's ""Rapunzel"" tale. ""Tangled"" was released in 2010, and became a blockbuster hit. The film earned $590 million in worldwide box office revenue, $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, and became the second most successful film of the studio, behind only ""The Lion King"". The film was well received by critics and audiences alike, and was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. ""Winnie the Pooh"" followed in 2011 and was a critical hit, but received modest returns at the box office. In 2012, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was released to critical acclaim and commercial success; winning numerous awards, including the Annie, Critics' Choice, and Kids' Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature Film and receiving Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, and earning $471 million in worldwide box office revenue. In addition, the studio won its first Academy Award for a short film in forty-four years with ""Paperman"". Directed by John Kahrs, ""Paperman"" utilized new software developed in house at the studio called Meander, which merges hand-drawn and computer animation techniques within the same character to create a unique ""hybrid"". According to Producer Kristina Reed, the studio is continuing to develop the technique for future projects, including an animated feature. In 2013, Walt Disney Animation Studios laid off fewer than 10 people out of a staff of more than 800. Because some were hand-drawn animators, there was exaggerated speculation on some animation blogs that the studio was abandoning traditional animation, an idea that the studio refused. Walt Disney Animation Studios' upcoming projects include ""Frozen"", a new computer animated fairy tale film inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" tale; ""Get a Horse!"", a black-and-white traditionally animated Mickey Mouse cartoon short; and ""Big Hero 6"", a CGI comedy-adventure film based on Marvel's ""Big Hero 6"" comics.

wikipedia-1303960," Benny Parsons  Benjamin Stewart Parsons (July 12, 1941 – January 16, 2007) was an American NASCAR driver, and later an announcer/analyst/pit reporter on SETN, TBS, ABC, ESPN, NBC and TNT. He became famous as the 1973 NASCAR Winston Cup (now Sprint Cup) champion. He was the older brother of former NASCAR driver car owner and broadcaster Phil Parsons of Phil Parsons Racing. He was nicknamed ""BP"" and ""The Professor"", the latter in part because of his popular remarks and relaxed demeanor. He was the founder of Rendezvous Ridge, a winery in North Carolina, which opened shortly after his death. Before NASCAR. Parsons spent his childhood years in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and played football for Millers Creek High School (now known as West Wilkes High School) in Wilkes County. Following high school, he moved to Detroit, Michigan where his father operated a taxicab company. Parsons worked at a gas station and drove cabs in Detroit before beginning his racing career. While working at the gas station one day, a couple of customers towing a race car invited him to a local race track. The driver of the car never showed up for that evening's race, and Parsons drove the car in a race for the first time later that night. Driving career. 1960s. Parsons began his NASCAR career by running one race in 1964 for Holman-Moody with a young Cale Yarborough. Parsons won the 1968 and 1969 ARCA championships. Parsons had three top-10 finishes in four NASCAR races in 1969. 1970s. He joined the NASCAR circuit full-time in 1970 with crew chief, John Hill. He had 23 top-10 finishes in 45 races, a pole at Langley Field Speedway, and finished eighth in the points. He raced in the #72 L.G. DeWitt/DeWitt Racing car. Parsons had 18 top-10 finishes in 35 starts in 1971, including his first win at South Boston Speedway. He finished eleventh in the points. In 1972 he had 19 top-10 finishes in 31 races. He finished fifth in the final points standings. In 1973 he won the NASCAR Championship with only one win, even though David Pearson won eleven races (but Pearson only entered eighteen events). Parsons' consistency likely won him the championship: he had 21 top-10 and 15 top-5 finishes in the 28 events. His improbable return to the track after an early crash cemented his championship at Rockingham, North Carolina. He saw his championship hopes start to fade as he was involved in a lap 13 crash and his car was heavily damaged. He took to the pits to muster whatever he could out of the car and hope for a top five finish in the final standings. The rest of the garage was hoping to see the underdog unseat the mighty Richard Petty and joined in to help Parsons' crew put the car back together. Parsons miraculously got back on the track 136 laps later and completed enough laps to finish 25th and take the 1973 championship. Richard Petty, with the championship in his sights after winning the pole and seeing Parsons' accident, had engine trouble and was relegated to a 35th place finish. The poor performance dropped Petty all the way to fifth in the final standings, as Cale Yarborough took the runner up spot on the season with his third place effort. He finished 67 points behind the champion. 1973 is considered the start of the modern era in NASCAR, so Parsons is considered the first modern era champion. Parsons also became the only person to win both ARCA and NASCAR championships. Parsons finished between third and fifth in the final points from 1974 to 1980. He won the 1975 Daytona 500. He switched to the #27 car for M.C. Anderson starting in 1979. In 1979 at North Wilkesboro Speedway Bobby Allison led most of the race but in the final 150 laps, Darrell Waltrip caught Allison. The two hit together hard and Darrell nailed the front stretch wall. Waltrip began crowding off Allison under the caution and got black flagged for the crowding. Benny Parsons would win the race, but it would be his only win at the North Wilkesboro Speedway, a track which his wife Terri (married from 1992 until his death in 2007) would become an investor two years after his death. 1980s. He won the 1980 World 600 at Charlotte and finished 3rd in points. In 1981 he starting racing in the #15 Bud Moore car. He had a win at Nashville Speedway USA and he won the final race at Texas World Speedway. He received his final top-ten points place finish, finishing tenth that year. Parsons qualified for the 1982 Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway at 200.175 miles per hour (mph), which was the first NASCAR qualification run over . Parsons raced in about half of the races between 1983 and 1986 for owner Johnny Hayes. Parsons final career victory came in 1984 at the Coca-Cola 500 at Atlanta. He appeared in the 1983 Burt Reynolds movie ""Stroker Ace"". Parsons returned to Hendrick Motorsports in 1987 as a substitute for driver Tim Richmond, who was stricken with AIDS and would succumb in 1989. During the first lap of a race at Darlington Raceway, Parsons hit the wall and badly damaged his race car. He was able to continue, but had to make several pit stops for repairs. At one point, his crew chief, Harry Hyde refused to allow Parsons to pit because he and the crew were on an ice cream break. This incident was alluded to in the film, ""Days of Thunder"". Another scene in the film was inspired by a real-life incident at Martinsville Speedway involving Parsons and the notoriously cantankerous Hyde: Hyde sarcastically told Parsons to hit the pace car on a restart because it was the only thing on the track Parsons had not hit. Parsons raced in the #90 Bulls Eye Ford for Junie Donlavey in his final NASCAR season in 1988 and then moved to the broadcast booth, a position where he would remain until his death. Parsons did climb into a race car a couple of other times, the first during the 2003 Old Dominion 500 as part of Wally's World segment and he drove a ceremonial victory lap at the last fall race at Rockingham in 2003 in a car similar to the one he won the championship with.  He is also credited for discovering current NASCAR Driver Greg Biffle at a ""Gong Show"" held in Tucson, Arizona. NASCAR announcer. He began announcing as a pit reporter in the 1980s on ESPN and TBS while he was still racing part-time. After permanently retiring from racing in 1988, Parsons became a broadcaster – first on ESPN, and then with NBC and TNT in 2001. He received an ESPN Emmy in 1996, and the ACE Award in 1989. He appears in the videogame ""NASCAR '99"", ""NASCAR 2000"" & ""NASCAR 2001"" as a commentator as well as an unlockable legend (He was only featured in ""NASCAR 2001"" as an announcer). He later appeared in ""NASCAR Rumble"" as a legend in the game as well as ""NASCAR Thunder 2002"", ""NASCAR Thunder 2003"" & ""NASCAR Thunder 2004"" as an unlockable driver and featured the game in NBC and TNT telecasts where Parsons did EA Sports Thunder Motion where he took viewers on a virtual ride of each track.  Parsons co-hosted coverage of Winston Cup Qualifying on North Carolina radio station WFMX with Mark Garrow in the early '90s. He continued to co-host a radio program called ""Fast Talk"" on Performance Racing Network (PRN) with Doug Rice until his death (he was replaced by an alternating host). He also had a podcast available on iTunes, in conjunction with CNN called ""The CNN Radio Racing Report with Benny Parsons,"" who talks about NASCAR with CNNRadio's Michael Jones.  In 2005, Parsons made a cameo appearance as himself in the movie '. In 2006, he again appeared as himself in '. Illness and death. Parsons began having trouble breathing in the summer of 2006. He was diagnosed with lung cancer. He announced later that the treatment had been successful, and that he had a clean bill of health. Parsons had stopped smoking in 1978.  His health prevented him from attending a ceremony in November 2006 where he was to be presented with the Myers Brothers Award, honoring his contributions to racing. On December 26, 2006, Parsons was readmitted to the hospital and placed in intensive care because of complications relating to lung cancer. On January 16, 2007, Parsons died of complications from lung cancer treatment in the intensive care unit of the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is buried near his childhood home in  Purlear, North Carolina, which is now the site of Benny Parsons' Rendezvous Ridge, which is also Terri's residence in addition to a racing museum and winery.

Together with brothers Thomas and Raymond, they inherited Sun Hung Kai Properties, Hong Kong's largest real estate developer, in 1990 following their father's death. Walter, formerly chairman and CEO of that organization, negotiated his departure from the family firm in 2010. His mother remains the controlling shareholder of the company, whilst his brothers manage the firm. The Kwok brothers are the third wealthiest people in Hong Kong and Greater China Region, just after Li Ka Shing and Lee Shau Kee. Their wealth is estimated to be 17 billion US dollars in Forbes' 2010 list of billionaires. Biography. According to the Standard, Kwok fell in love with an ambitious lawyer Ida Tong Kam-hing (唐錦馨), but his father did not allow him to marry her. His parents introduced him to Lydia Ku, whom he married, but the marriage broke up six months afterwards. Later, he married his present wife, Wendy Lee. 1997 abduction. Kwok was kidnapped by the notorious gangster ""Big Spender"" Cheung Tze-keung on September 30, 1997, and was released seven days later without police intervention. Negotiations fronted by wife Wendy resulted in payment of a ransom rumoured to have been in nine figures. Following his arrest in Guangzhou in 1998, Cheung confessed that he had put Kwok in a wooden container blindfolded for four days, and fed him regular meals of roast pork with rice, until the ransom of some HK$600 million was paid. The ransom in 1,000 dollar notes was packed inside 20 large carrier bags and driven in two Mercedes saloon cars to a quiet lane in Central district. After the kidnap, the badly shaken Walter handed over the executive duties of SHKP to his younger brothers while retaining the title of Chairman and Chief Executive. His abductor was executed in the People's Republic of China in December 1998. As a result of his kidnapping ordeal, Walter reportedly developed deep psychological problems, and while he retained the titles of chairman and chief executive, his two brothers Thomas and Raymond controlled day-to-day operations of the group. Under Walter's later chairmanship, press reported that a former girlfriend, Ida Tong, had become increasingly influential. This influence has led to business decisions by Kwok which departed from its previous conservative model, and without the consensus of his brothers. On 18 February 2008, Sun Hung Kai Properties issued a statement saying Walter would take a temporary leave of absence for personal reasons with immediate effect. Walter later issued a statement stating he would take a personal holiday to travel to the United States, Beijing and other big cities in the coming two to three months. He said he would resume his duties on his return. ""Sing Tao Daily"" and sister publication ""The Standard"" reported that matriarch Mrs. Kwok Kwong Siu-hing, wielding the holding of the Sun Hung Kai trust, intervened to oust Walter from his chairman position to protect the family's interests. It was revealed that Ida's influence, through being Walter's mistress of four years, has been causing friction with his brothers. On 29 February, tycoon and fellow board member Lee Shau Kee confirmed that, during the last board meeting, Mrs Kwok had forced the leave of absence on Walter. Lee further painted a picture of a lonely Walter, as only Ida would listen to him. In mid May 2008, Walter brought a lawsuit against his brothers, and persuaded a judge to enjoin a board meeting, saying that Raymond and Thomas had him diagnosed as bipolar disorder in order to sideline him and silence his criticism of certain business decisions. In 2012, younger brothers Thomas and Raymond, as well as Rafael Hui, previously the second-highest ranking government official in Hong Kong, were arrested by the city's anti-corruption agency on suspicion of bribery. It has been suggested that Walter, who was not arrested, was the one who passed information to the authorities, supposedly in revenge for his ouster from Sun Hung Kai Properties a few years earlier.

wikipedia-1303985," Encaustic tile  Encaustic tiles are ceramic tiles in which the pattern or figure on the surface is not a product of the glaze but of different colors of clay. They are usually of two colors but a tile may be composed of as many as six. The pattern appears inlaid into the body of the tile, so that the design remains as the tile is worn down. Encaustic tiles may be glazed or unglazed and the inlay may be as shallow as an eighth of an inch, as is often the case with ""printed"" encaustic tile from the later medieval period, or as deep as a quarter inch. History. What were called encaustic tiles in the Victorian era were originally called inlaid tiles during the medieval period. The use of the word ""encaustic"" to describe an inlaid tile of two or more colors is linguistically incorrect. The word encaustic from means ""burning in"" from the ""en"", ""in"" and ""kaiein"", ""to burn"". The term originally described a process of painting with a beeswax-based paint that was then fixed with heat. It was also applied to a process of medieval enameling. The term did not come into use when describing tile until the nineteenth century. Supposedly, Victorians thought that the two colour tiles strongly resembled enamel work and so called them encaustic. Despite the error, the term has now been in common use for so long that it is an accepted name for inlaid tile work. Encaustic or inlaid tiles enjoyed two periods of great popularity. The first came in the thirteenth century and lasted until Henry the Eighth's reformation in the sixteenth century. The second came when the tiles caught the attention of craftsmen during the Gothic Revival era, who after much trial and error mass-produced these tiles, made them available to the general public. During both periods tiles were made across Western Europe though the center of tile production was in England. Companies in the United States also made encaustic tile during the Gothic Revival architecture style's period. The American Encaustic Tiling Company of Zanesville, Ohio, was active until the 1930s. Manufacture. Modern encaustic tiles use a two-shot moulding process. The 'inlay' colour is moulded first. For multiple colours, a mould with cavities for each colour is used and the individual colours are filled carefully. This coloured clay is then placed face-down in a mould that is backfilled with the body colour. The tiles are then fired. Tiles may be made of either fired clay, or cement The manufacture of encaustic clay tiles may be seen today at the Jackfield Tile Museum, one of the Ironbridge Gorge museums. Use. In both medieval times and in the nineteenth and twentieth century Gothic Revival, tiles were most often made for and laid in churches. Even tiles that were laid in private homes were often copies of those found in religious settings. Encaustic tile floors exist all over Europe and North America but are most prevalent in England where the greatest numbers of inlaid tiles were made. "
wikipedia-1303995," Princeton Branch  The Princeton Branch is a commuter rail line and service owned and operated by New Jersey Transit (NJT) in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The line is a short branch of the Northeast Corridor Line, running from Princeton Junction northwest to Princeton with no intermediate stops. Also known as the Dinky Line, or the Princeton Junction and Back (PJ&B), the branch is served by special shuttle trains. At it is the shortest scheduled commuter rail line in the United States. The run takes 4 minutes, 47 seconds. Service. The Princeton Branch provides rail service directly to the Princeton University campus from Princeton Junction, where New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains that go to Newark, New York City, and Philadelphia can be boarded. Peak period trains leave Princeton on weekdays between 5:59 am and 8:14 pm, approximately, and leave Princeton Junction on weekdays between 5:03 am and 8:10 pm, approximately (some trains handle both peak and off-peak commuters to and from the Northeast Corridor). There are 41 departures in each direction daily. The line is served by a single or two-car set of Budd Arrow III self-propelled electric coach cars. The Federal Railroad Administration considers any power car to be a locomotive. History. When the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company opened its original Trenton-New Brunswick line in 1839, the line was located along the east bank of the Delaware and Raritan Canal, about one mile (2 km) from downtown Princeton. The new alignment (now the Northeast Corridor Line) opened in 1863, but some passenger trains continued to use the old line until the Princeton Branch opened on May 29, 1865, using a Grice & Long steam dummy for passenger service. The Pennsylvania Railroad leased and began to operate the C&A, including the Princeton Branch, in 1871. Penn Central Transportation took over operations in 1968. When Conrail was formed in 1976, the Final System Plan called for the transfer of the Princeton Branch to Conrail and then to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but the transfer to NJDOT was not made until 1984. The Princeton train, locally called the ""Dinky"" or the ""PJ&B"" (for ""Princeton Junction and Back""), is a unique symbol of Princeton University that has grown over time to emblemize the University. It is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""This Side of Paradise"", featured in the TV program ""Family Ties"" when young Alex P. Keaton goes for his on-campus interview, and it is also in the 1934 Bing Crosby Movie ""She Loves Me Not"". The theme of Princeton and the train is repeated again in the University's own traditional homecoming song ""Going Back to Nassau Hall"" by Kenneth S. Clark (1905). In it, the line ""We'll clear the track as we go back"" refers to the Princeton Branch tracks that stop on campus. The Great Dinky Robbery. The Great Dinky Robbery was a prank perpetrated by four Princeton University students on Friday, May 3, 1963. At the time, Princeton was an all-male school and the Dinky was the primary means of transportation for women coming to the campus to meet their dates. In the ""Robbery"", four students on horseback ambushed the train as it was arriving in the Princeton Junction station. A convertible was parked across the track forcing the Dinky to come to an abrupt halt. At that point, the ersatz cowboys rode up to the Dinky, and, led by George Bunn '63 who was armed with a pistol loaded with blanks, boarded and seized four girls selected on the spot. The riders and their newly-found dates rode off on the horses, the convertible was moved off the tracks, and the Dinky arrived safely, albeit a few minutes late. Although the University administrators were aware of the event and knew who was involved, they took no official action against them. Proposed changes. Station relocation controversy. Princeton University plans a campus expansion at the site of the branch's northern terminal station that will move the station 460 feet south of its current location. Rail advocates fear that access to the new station would be less convenient, resulting in decreased ridership that would ""threaten the train's existence.""  In 2010 the Princeton Regional Planning Board and New Jersey Transit (NJT) presented plans to convert the train to a Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) that would be part of a larger regional BRT system. In April 2010 a group formed on the social network site, Facebook, called ""Save the Princeton Dinky"". It has attracted over 6,000 alumni, locals and others in support of keeping the Dinky train. The group has now become a registered New Jersey nonprofit organization with its own website, savethedinky.org. The Princeton Regional Planning Board ultimately passed a resolution supporting the continuation of train service. On October 4, 2011, by a vote of 3-2, Princeton Borough Council voted to ratify an agreement whereby Princeton University promises to fund a transit study and provide other benefits in exchange for rezoning for its ""Arts and Transit"" project. In 2013, NJT approved a transfer of property agreement with the university involving three parcels around the station and proposed arts center. At the same time the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers and the National Association of Railroad Passengers petitioned the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) to review the planned move. The petition asks that STB to assert its jurisdiction over the Princeton Branch and require any truncation of the line be made only with the federal agency's express approval since there is a partial abandonment of the right of way involved. Dinky Transitway. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and New Jersey Transit are conducting studies to develop the Central New Jersey Route 1 Bus Rapid Transit Project. Part of the proposals call for the construction of the ""Dinky Transitway"" along the Princeton Branch right-of-way, which would incorporate the rail service and add exclusive bus lanes and a greenway for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. In April 2012, the university submitted revised plans for the arts and transit center, which calls for the extension of the station house onto to right of way for possible use as restaurant. The Regional Planning Board has passed an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend farther into the central business district at Nassau Street. The new station house plans would require the board's approval before construction could start. According to the university, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the transitway to implemented. While NJT has indicated that moving the station would not be detrimental to its planning and requested abandonment of that public use of the station house from the State Historic Preservation Office. In June 2013, an agreement approved by NJT transfer between the agency and the university indicates that a new station and bus transfer facility will be constructed built by the university. "

wikipedia-1304000," Alraune  Alraune (German for ""Mandrake"") is a novel by German novelist Hanns Heinz Ewers published in 1911. It is also the name of the female lead character. Legend. The basis of the story of Alraune dates to the Middles Ages in Germany. The humanoid-shaped Mandrake root or ""Mandragora officinarum"" was widely believed to be produced by the semen of hanged men under the gallows. Alchemists claimed that hanged men ejaculated after their necks were broken and that the earth absorbed their final ""strengths"". In some versions, it is blood instead of semen. The root itself was used in love philtres and potions while its fruit was supposed to facilitate pregnancy. Witches who ""made love"" to the Mandrake root were said to produce offspring which had no feelings of real love and had no soul. Fiction. The novel deviates from the myth by concentrating on the issues of artificial insemination and individuality: genetics versus environment. A scientist, Professor Jakob ten Brinken, interested in the laws of heredity, impregnates a prostitute in a laboratory with the semen of a hanged murderer. The prostitute conceives a female child who has no concept of love, whom the professor adopts. The girl, Alraune, suffers from obsessive sexuality and perverse relationships throughout her life. She learns of her unnatural origins and she avenges herself against the professor. In other media. There have been a number of films based on the myth and the novel of ""Alraune"". Several movies have shown the influence of the Alraune theme: "
wikipedia-1304003," Wallasey  Wallasey is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside, England, on the mouth of the River Mersey, at the northeastern corner of the Wirral Peninsula. According to the 2001 Census, the town had a total resident population of 58,710. History. Toponymy. The name of Wallasey originates from the Germanic word ""Walha"", meaning stranger or foreigner, which is also the origin of the name Wales. The suffix “""-ey""” denotes an island or area of dry land. Originally the higher ground now occupied by Wallasey was separated from the rest of Wirral by the creek known as Wallasey Pool (which later became the docks), the marshy areas of Bidston Moss and Leasowe, and sand dunes along the coast. Early history. Historically part of Cheshire, the area was sparsely populated before the 19th century. Horse races organised for the Earls of Derby on the sands at Leasowe in the 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as forerunners of the modern Derby. Old maps show that the main centre and parish church (St Hilary’s) were located at what is now called Wallasey Village, and there were smaller hamlets at Liscard, Poulton and Seacombe, from where there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. There was also a mill (at Mill Lane), and from the mid-18th century a gunpowder store or magazine at Rock Point, located well away from the built-up areas. The main activities in the area were farming and fishing. The area also had a reputation for smuggling and “wrecking”, the act of luring ships onto rocks or sandbanks with false lights in order to raid their cargo. Underground cellars and tunnels, which were used to hide cargo pilfered from wrecked ships still exist in the town. As late as 1839, the “Pennsylvania” and two other ships were wrecked off Leasowe in a severe storm, and their cargoes and furnishings were later found distributed among local residents. Early 19th century development. By the early 19th century, the shoreline between Seacombe and Rock Point started to become an attractive area to which affluent Liverpool merchants and sea captains could retire. Development at Egremont began around this time, and gained pace with the introduction of steam ferries across the river. The area also had a defensive role overlooking the growing Port of Liverpool. In 1829, Fort Perch Rock was built, and in 1858 Liscard Battery. In 1830, the merchant James Atherton purchased much of the land at Rock Point, which enjoyed views out to sea and across the Mersey and had a good beach. His aim was to develop it as a desirable residential and watering place for the gentry, in a similar way to one of the most elegant seaside resorts of that Regency period – hence ""New Brighton"". Substantial development began soon afterwards, and housing began to spread up the hillside overlooking the estuary - the gunpowder magazine being closed down in 1851. In 1835 Liscard Hall was built by another merchant, Sir John Tobin. Its grounds later became Central Park. His family also developed a “model farm” nearby. With the expansion of trade on the Mersey, new docks were constructed between 1842 and 1847 in the Wallasey Pool, and by 1877 the dock system between Wallasey and neighbouring Birkenhead was largely complete. The area around the docks became a centre for engineering industries, many associated with shipbuilding, and other activities including sugar refining and the manufacture of cement and fertilisers. Bidston Dock, the last in the area, was opened in 1933, but was filled in during 2003. Later growth and the 20th century. During the latter half of the 19th century New Brighton developed as a very popular seaside resort serving Liverpool and the Lancashire industrial towns, and many of the large houses were converted to inexpensive hotels. A pier was opened in the 1860s, and the promenade from Seacombe to New Brighton was built in the 1890s. This served both as a recreational amenity in its own right, and to link up the developments along the estuary, and was later extended westwards towards Leasowe. The New Brighton Tower, the tallest in the country, was opened in 1900 but closed in 1919 and dismantled shortly afterwards. However, its ballroom continued as a major venue, hosting numerous concerts in the 1950s and 1960s by local Liverpool bands as well as other international stars. After 1886, with the opening of the Mersey Railway allowing access via a tunnel to Liverpool, the pace of housing development increased, particularly in the Liscard and Wallasey Village areas. The area now called Wallasey comprises several distinct districts which gradually merged to form a single built-up area during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Further growth continued well into the 20th century and eventually spread into the Leasowe area and beyond to Moreton. The UK's first guide dog training school, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, was founded in the town in 1931. The Wallasey Golf Club is where club member, Dr Frank Stableford, developed the Stableford system of points scoring. This was first used in competition in 1932. Because of its docks and proximity to Liverpool, parts of the area suffered aerial bombing in 1940-41. After the Second World War, the popularity of New Brighton as a seaside resort declined dramatically, as did the use of the docks, and Wallasey gradually became more obviously a residential suburb for Liverpool, Birkenhead and the other towns in the area. The Beatles played some of their first shows outside Liverpool at the Grosvenor Ballroom in Liscard in 1960, and over the next few years also played several times at the Tower Ballroom in New Brighton. On 12 October 1962, they played there as the support act for Little Richard. Wallasey was also the home base of another leading Merseybeat group, the Undertakers featuring Jackie Lomax. The world's first passenger hovercraft service operated from July 1962 to September 1962 between Leasowe and Rhyl in North Wales. Local MP Ernest Marples was responsible as Minister of Transport (1959–64) for introducing parking meters, yellow lines and seat belt controls to the UK. The ""Solar Campus"" on Leasowe Road was the first building in the world to be heated entirely by solar energy. It was formerly St George’s Secondary School, and was built in 1961 to the designs of Emslie Morgan. The solar panels on this establishment have since been removed due to high costs and has been renamed. Civic history. Wallasey became a County Borough in 1913, and its town hall opened in 1916. The borough boundaries expanded to include Moreton and Saughall Massie in 1928. The County Borough of Wallasey was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral on 1 April 1974. The town is contained in the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey, which has been held since the 1992 general election by Angela Eagle of the Labour Party. Education. When compared to the national average, the schools of Wallasey slightly underperform on GCSE results. However they are above the national average on A Level results. Geography. The area now called Wallasey comprises several distinct districts - Egremont, Liscard, New Brighton, Poulton, Seacombe and Wallasey Village. These gradually merged to form a single built-up area during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike in most other towns, there is no single Wallasey town centre, although the main shopping area is centrally located at Liscard. Both the parliamentary constituency and the former County Borough of Wallasey also include (or included) Leasowe, Moreton and Saughall Massie, which are now usually regarded as separate settlements. Liscard. This contains the main shopping area, with the covered Cherry Tree precinct and an extensive shopping parade outside. Central Park, originally the grounds of Liscard Hall, is the largest park in the town. Much of the area is residential and contains mainly high-density semi-detached housing with some terraces. The gatehouse of the old Liscard Battery remains. Liscard Hall was destroyed by a fire on 7 July 2008. The damage was so severe, the whole building had to be demolished. Wallasey Village. Wallasey Village has a mixture popular mostly 20th century semi-detached and detached housing, a shopping street, with a floral roundabout in the centre. St Hilary’s Church is an ancient foundation; the old tower is all that remains of a 1530 church building which burned down in 1857. There are two railway stations, Wallasey Village and Wallasey Grove Road. At the north end of Wallasey Village, the main street leads to the promenade and coastal park, and two golf courses. The promenade passes here, running from the 'Gunsite' around to Seacombe, a total of over . New Brighton. New Brighton was a popular seaside resort after the mid-19th century, but declined in popularity after the 1950s. Nevertheless, the marine promenade is part of a popular walk and the areas near the sea offer a much improved beach and many leisure activities. The Floral Pavilion plays host to regular productions and national stars such as Ken Dodd, and Vale Park is a beautiful public park. Housing here ranges from large villas near the sea to suburban semi-detached homes, while there are some less attractive terraces in parts of the area. New Brighton is served by a railway station of the same name. New Brighton promenade is the UK's longest promenade. Poulton. Poulton was originally a small fishing and farming hamlet beside the Wallasey Pool (hence its name). It developed with the growth of the docks, mainly as an industrial and terraced housing area. Egremont. Egremont developed as an affluent residential area in the early 19th century, and was named by one Captain Askew who built a house in the area in 1835 and named it after his Cumberland birthplace. Egremont Pier was built in 1827 and was the longest pier on Merseyside until it was damaged irreparably in 1946 when a coaster collided with it. Wallasey Town Hall, an imposing edifice opened in 1916 and initially used as a war hospital, is located here, overlooking the estuary and with its back to the town. Seacombe. Seacombe, the most southeasterly section of Wallasey, is best known for its Mersey Ferry terminal, with regular ferry boat departures to Pier Head in Liverpool and Woodside in Birkenhead. There is a commuter ferry service direct to Liverpool during peak hours, while for the rest of the day the ferries are geared to serving tourists with a circular cruise visiting Birkenhead Woodside ferry terminal as well. Seacombe is the last remaining of the three ferry terminals which used to connect the Borough of Wallasey, the others being Egremont Ferry and the New Brighton Ferry, which operated from its own pier, running parallel to the New Brighton pleasure pier. Seacombe Ferry is also the starting point of a four mile unbroken promenade, mostly traffic-free, running alongside the River Mersey to Harrison Drive beyond New Brighton. Local landmarks are St Paul's Church, standing on its own traffic island, and the ventilation tower for the Kingsway Tunnel with its mighty extraction fans. As with Poulton, the area developed with housing for the dockworkers and nearby industries, and much of the housing is owned by Wirral Partnership Homes or are terraced. The Guinea Gap swimming baths are located between Seacombe and Egremont. Transport. Rail. Present. There are three railway stations: Wallasey Village, Wallasey Grove Road and New Brighton. Electric trains to Liverpool and Birkenhead depart every 15 minutes (every 30 minutes during late evenings and on Sundays). Grove Road station has a large car park with over 160 spaces. There are also railway stations located in Leasowe and Moreton on the railway to West Kirby. Past. Formerly, an additional railway line ran from Seacombe (& Egremont) station to Wrexham. An intermediate station served Liscard & Poulton. The line, and both stations, closed to passengers in 1960 when the trains were diverted to New Brighton. Subsequently these trains were diverted away from Wallasey to start from Birkenhead North and nowadays from Bidston. The cutting where the line once ran now forms the approach road to the Kingsway Tunnel, and Seacombe station site was developed for housing. Bus. Until 1969, Wallasey had its own corporation bus service; from this date the operation was taken over by Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive. The Wallasey bus service was relatively constrained within the borough boundaries, and had two distinctive features. One was the unusual livery, which appeared to be two shades of yellow (officially it was ""sea green"" and rich cream, but it always looked yellow and the service was generally known as the ""yellow buses""). Secondly the services mostly radiated from Seacombe Ferry terminal across the borough, and bus departures coincided with the arrival of the ferry. Vehicles were lined up facing outwards from the kerb and every 10–15 minutes the passengers (several hundreds at peak hours) would arrive from the ferry boat. When all had boarded their respective routes the inspector in charge would blow a whistle and there would be an amazing Le Mans-style start with up to fifteen double-decker buses, including racing engines, close manoeuvring, and competitive gestures between the crews, for the first few hundred yards until the routes gradually diverged across the borough. Now, regular bus services (Arriva routes 402, 413 and 423) depart Liscard every 10 minutes and travel via the Kingsway Tunnel to Liverpool. In addition, there are several services which link the districts of Wallasey and nearby towns such as Birkenhead, Leasowe and Moreton. Notable people. The following people were born in Wallasey: Eric Idle, of ""Monty Python"" fame, lived in Wallasey between the ages of three and nine (1946–1952). Other former residents include Matthew Smith, games programmer who developed several well-known titles for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in the 1980s; and Simon ""Sice"" Rowbottom (b 1969) and Timothy Brown from the band the Boo Radleys. England International darts player Robbie ""Kong"" Green lives in the town. "

wikipedia-1279966," Moody Blue  Moody Blue is the final studio album by Elvis Presley. The album was a mixture of live and studio work, and included the four tracks from Presley's final studio recording sessions in October 1976 and two tracks left over from the previous Graceland session in February 1976. ""Moody Blue"" was a previously published hit song recorded at the earlier Graceland session and held over for this album. Also recorded at the February session was ""She Thinks I Still Care"". ""Way Down"" became a hit after Presley's death less than one month after this album's publication. As described in ""Elvis: The Illustrated Record"", RCA was not able to obtain sufficient new studio material for a complete album, with all but six songs of Presley's studio recordings of 1976 having already been used in the previous album, ""From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee"". The company chose to augment the remaining available works with three live songs recorded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on April 24 and 26, 1977, including his version of ""Unchained Melody"" which was the album's third single, released posthumously. RCA and the producer Felton Jarvis had booked a recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee, for January 1977, to record some new tracks for this album. Presley had chosen a few songs to record with the help of Jarvis, most of them were rather country and uptempo. Unfortunately, Presley never showed up at that session, claiming that he was sick and thus staying home (an excuse that Presley used rather frequently during the 1960s to avoid recording poor soundtracks for his motion pictures). Jarvis and RCA had nothing left to do but to fill the album with the live tracks mentioned above. Also included is a live performance of ""Let Me Be There"" which had already been released three years earlier on his album """". The song ""Moody Blue"" was released as a single in December 1976 and it reached number one on the Billboard Country Singles Chart, and #31 on the pop chart. ""Way Down"" was released as the album's next single during the early summer of 1977. It did not go very far up the chart, but it soared to #18 after Presley's death in August (jumping to number one in the U.K.) It was a bigger hit on the country charts, and it had risen to number one in the same week of the death of Presley. This album reached number three on the Billboard album charts after his death, although it had already entered the top 40 before he died. This was the last album by Presley to reach the TOP 40. ""Moody Blue"" was also a number one album on the Country Albums chart. ""Moody Blue"" was published on July 19, 1977, and it peaked on the album chart in August 1977. RCA pressed the album on blue vinyl, to match the title track. Since colored vinyl pressings were relatively rare, and they almost never occurred in a wide release, this has led to collectors mistakenly assuming that blue-vinyl albums of ""Moody Blue"" are collectors' items, when in fact the true collectables are pressings from immediately before Presley's death on standard black vinyl. (Immediately following his death, the production of ""Moody Blue"" was shifted back to blue vinyl. However, in some later years the album was produced using standard black vinyl). Following Presley's death, ""Unchained Melody"" was also released as a single, and it peaked at #6 on the country music charts. The original CD issue had the standard songs of the original. The CD reissue of the year 2000 revised the cover art including a different concert photo of Elvis, omitted the track ""Let Me Be There"", due to its presence on """", and it added the complete album ""From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee"" as tracks 10-19 - in effect compiling the Graceland sessions rather than reissuing the album. It was certified Gold and Platinum on 9/12/1977 and 2x Platinum on 3/27/1992 by the RIAA. "
wikipedia-1279974," Constitution of Austria  The Constitution of Austria (""Österreichische Bundesverfassung"") is the body of all constitutional law of the Republic of Austria on the federal level. It is split up over many different acts. Its centerpiece is the ""Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (B-VG)"", which includes the most important federal constitutional provisions.  Apart from the B-VG, there are a large number of other constitutional acts (called Bundesverfassungsgesetze, singular Bundesverfassungsgesetz, abbrev. BVG, i.e. without the dash) and individual provisions in statutes and treaties which are designated as constitutional (""Verfassungsbestimmung""). For example, the B-VG does not include a bill of rights, but provisions on civil liberties are split up over different constitutional legislative acts. Over time, both the B-VG and the numerous pieces of constitutional law supplementing it have undergone literally hundreds of minor and major amendments and revisions. History. Austria has been governed by multiple Constitutions, including the Pillersdorf Constitution in 1848, the ""irrevocable"" Stadion Constitution from 1848 to 1851, the October Diploma in 1860, the February Patent from 1861 until 1865. The B-VG was based on a draft by Hans Kelsen and first enacted on October 1, 1920. Since political agreement over a bill of rights could not be reached, the ""Basic law on the general rights of citizens"" (""Staatsgrundgesetz über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger"") of 1867 was left in place and designated as constitutional law. Originally, the B-VG was very parliamentarian in character. The prerogative to enact law was to lie with a comparatively strong parliament, the Federal Assembly composed of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The responsibility for implementing law was to reside with a cabinet headed by a chancellor, who was nominated by the National Council on a motion by its principal committee. A relatively weak president, who was elected by both houses, was to serve as head of state. In 1929, the constitution underwent a revision significantly broadening the prerogatives of the president. In particular, the president from then on was to be elected directly by the people rather than by the members of the legislature. The president was also to be vested with the authority to dissolve the parliament, a power typically not held by heads of executive branches of parliamentary republics. He also had the authority to formally appoint the chancellor and the cabinet. Although the president was vested with powers comparable to those of the President of the United States, in practice he acted on the advice of the chancellor. This move away from a government steered predominantly by a fairly large and (by definition) fractioned deliberative body towards a system concentrating power in the hands of a single autonomous leader was made in an attempt to appease the para-fascist movements (such as the Heimwehr, the Republikanischer Schutzbund or later the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen) thriving in Austria at that time.  In 1934, following years of increasingly violent political strife and gradual erosion of the rule of law, the ruling Christian Social Party, which by then had turned to full-scale Austrofascism, formally replaced the constitution by a new basic law defining Austria as an authoritarian corporate state. The Austrofascist constitution was in force until Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, ceasing to exist as a sovereign state. The Constitution of Austria was eventually reinstated on May 1, 1945, Austria having reestablished itself as an independent republic shortly before Nazi Germany's definitive collapse. The modifications enacted in 1929 were not then rescinded, and essentially remain in effect until this day, although the constitution has been heavily modified and amended since then. Structure. The Republic of Austria is slightly smaller than Maine, Scotland, or Hokkaidō and home to an ethnically and culturally homogeneous population of barely more than eight million people. Given that almost one fourth of its inhabitants are concentrated in the city of Vienna and its adjacent suburbs, the nation is also naturally unipolar in terms of both economic and cultural activity. Austria's constitutional framework nevertheless characterizes the republic as a federation consisting of nine autonomous federal states: Just like the federation, the nine states of Austria all have written state constitutions defining them to be republican entities governed according to the principles of representative democracy. The state constitutions congruently define the states to be unicameral parliamentary democracies; each state has a legislature elected by popular vote and a cabinet appointed by its legislature. The federal constitution defines Austria itself as a bicameral parliamentary democracy with near-complete separation of powers. Austria's government structure is thus highly similar to that of incomparably larger federal republics such as Germany or the United States. The main practical difference between Austria on the one hand and Germany or the United States on the other hand is that Austria's states have comparatively little autonomy: almost all matters of practical importance,including but not limited to defense, foreign politics, criminal law, corporate law, most other aspects of economic law, education, academia, welfare, telecommunications, and the health care system, lie with the federation. This is also true for the judiciary system, which is exclusively federal in Austria, meaning that there are no state courts. Federal legislature. Federal legislative powers are vested with a body the constitution refers to as a parliament. Ever since the somewhat paradoxical 1929 revision of the constitution, which strengthened the formal separation of powers in Austria at the instigation of sympathizers of fascism, Austria's legislature technically bears more resemblance to a congress than to a parliament. As a practical matter, however, it continues to function as a parliament anyway. Austria's parliament consists of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The 183 members of the National Council are elected by nation-wide popular vote under statutes aiming at party-list proportional representation. The currently 64 members of the Federal Council are elected by Austria's nine state legislatures under a statute allocating seats roughly proportional to state population size (The largest Bundesland being entitled to twelve members, the others accordingly, but no state to less than three.) In theory, the National Council and the Federal Council are peers. As a practical matter, the National Council is decidedly more powerful; the predominance of the National Council is such that Austrians frequently use the term ""parliament"" to refer to just the National Council instead of to the parliament as a whole.  While bicameral legislatures such as the Congress of the United States allow bills to originate in both chambers, Austrian federal legislation always originates in the National Council, never in the Federal Council. In theory, bills can be sponsored by National Council members, by the federal cabinet, by popular initiative, or through a motion supported by at least one-third of the members of the Federal Council. In practice, most bills are proposed by the cabinet and get passed after mere token debate. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for affirmation. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for a period of eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. Bills passed by both houses (or passed by the National Council and ignored by the Federal Council) are ultimately signed into law by the federal president. The president does not have the power to veto bills, his or her signature is a technical formality notarizing that the bill has been introduced and resolved upon in accordance to the procedure stipulated by the constitution. The president does not even have the authority to refuse signing a bill he or she deems unconstitutional as such; a bill may be vetoed only on the grounds that its genesis, not its substance, is in violation of basic law. Adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the bill itself is the exclusive prerogative of the Constitutional Court.  Provided that the bill in question neither amends the constitution such that states' rights are curtailed nor in some other way pertains to the organization of the legislature itself, the National Council can force the bill into law even if the Federal Council rejects it; a National Council resolution overruling a Federal Council objection merely has to meet a higher quorum than a regular resolution. For this reason, the Federal Council has hardly any real power to prevent the adoption of legislation, the National Council being trivially able to override it. The Federal Council is sometimes compared to the British House of Lords, another deliberative body able to stall but usually not to strike down proposed law. While the House of Lords occasionally exercises its stalling power, however, the Federal Council hardly ever does. Since the parties controlling the National Council consistently also hold a majority in the Federal Council, the latter gives its blessing to essentially everything the former has adopted. Federal executive. Federal executive authority is vested with the federal president, an official elected by popular vote for a term of six years and limited to two consecutive terms of office. The president is the head of state and appoints the federal cabinet, a body consisting of the federal chancellor and a number of ministers. The president also appoints the members of the Constitutional Court and numerous other public officials, represents the republic in international relations, accredits foreign ambassadors, and acts as the nominal commander in chief of Austria's armed forces.  While Austria's federal cabinet is technically not answerable to the legislature (except for a motion of censure), it would be almost totally paralyzed without the active support of the National Council. Since constitutional convention prevents the executive from exerting its authority to dissolve the Nation Council, the president is unable to hector the legislature into doing his or her bidding, and the president's cabinet is for all intents and purposes subject to National Council approval. The cabinet's composition therefore reflects National Council election results rather than presidential election outcomes.  After elections, it is customary for the President to ask the leader of the strongest party to become chancellor and form a cabinet. Since this party leader, for all intents and purposes, needs a majority in the National Council, he will usually seek to form a coalition with another political party or parties. The coalition then agrees on a list of ministers, customarily including the coalition parties' leaders. (Obviously, if a party holds a majority in the National Council all by itself, no such coalition is needed. This has happened in the past, but, owing to the growing number of political parties in Austria and the system of proportional representation will not likely again any time soon.) The list is then submitted to the president by the chancellor-to-be; the president usually adopts it without much argument, although there has been at least one case in recent history where the president did refuse to install a minister. The president retains the right to dismiss the whole cabinet at will, or certain ministers of it at the request of the chancellor. Although elected for a four-year term (changing to five after the next elections), the National Council can dissolve itself at any time, bringing about new elections. The federal chancellor's dual role as executive officeholder and heavyweight party official well-connected to the legislature makes him or her far more powerful than the formally senior federal president. Actual executive authority thus lies with the chancellor and his or her ministers, while the federal president is a figurehead rather than an actual head of government. Austria's presidents are largely content with their ceremonial role,  striving for the role of impartial mediator and dignified Elder Statesman, and more or less consistently steer clear of the murky waters of hands-on politics. The stern frown worn by the late president Thomas Klestil while swearing in Wolfgang Schüssel's controversial cabinets was at the time widely considered the strongest unilateral political statement made by any Austrian president. In recent times, however, the current holder of office, Heinz Fischer, has been known to comment on current political issues from time to time. Judicial and administrative review. Federal and state judicial authority, in particular responsibility for judicial review of administrative acts, lies with the Administrative and Constitutional Court System, a structure essentially consisting of the Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court. The Constitutional Court examines the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament, the legality of regulations by Federal ministers and finally alleged infringements of constitutional rights of individuals through acts of the administration. It also tries disputes between the federation and its member states, demarcation disputes between other courts and impeachments of the federal president (serving as State Court in that matter.) The Administrative Court tries all kinds of cases which involve ""ex officio"" decisions by public officials or bodies and which are not dealt with by the Constitutional Court. Note that only the Constitutional Court has the authority to strike down laws.  In recent years, an increasing number of tribunals of a judicial nature (article 133 point 4 B-VG) have been introduced in a number of areas to improve the review of the conduct of administrative authorities. The most important among them are the Länder independent administrative chambers (""Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate"" - UVS), who decide, amongst other things, on second authority in proceedings relating to administrative contraventions as well as recourses against acts of direct exercise of command and constraint power from administrative authorities. Other such chambers are competent in the area of tax law (""Unabhängiger Finanzsenat""- UFS), in terms of asylum (""Unabhängiger Bundesasylsenat"" - UBAS), in relation to environmental matters (""Unabhängiger Umweltsenat"") or in the field of telecommunications (""Unabhängiger Bundeskommunikationssenat""). Although all these tribunals are formally part of the administrative organization, their members have guarantees of independence and irremovability and may thus be compared to jurisdictions. Their rulings may be challenged before the Administrative or the Constitutional Court. The Austrian constitution was the first in the world (nearly contemporaneous with Czechoslovakia) to enact judicial review. It had been established in 1919 and gained the right to revise the laws of the federal states that year. After the new constitution had been adopted in 1920 it was also entiteld to revise national laws according to the constitution. This scheme of a separate constitutional court reviews legislative acts for their constitutionality came to be known as the ""Austrian system"". After the U.S. and Australia, where the regular court system is in charge of judicial review, Austria was the third country in the world to have judicial review at all (although the Czechoslovak Constitution came into force earlier, the establishment of the Court's new rights itself predated the Czechoslovak Court by a couple of months). Many European countries adopted the Austrian system of review after World War II. Judiciary. Judicial powers not committed to the Administrative and Constitutional Court System are vested with the Civil and Criminal Court System, a structure consisting of civil courts on the one hand and criminal courts on the other hand. Civil courts try all cases in which both the claimant and the respondent are private citizens or corporations, including but not limited to contract and torts disputes: Austria's legal system, having evolved from that of the Roman Empire, implements civil law and therefore lacks the distinction between courts of law and courts of equity sometimes found in common law jurisdictions. Civil courts do not try suits against the federation or its states in their capacity as administrative units, but only when acting in the form of private law. Most cases are tried before District Courts (Bezirksgerichte, abbrev.: BG, singular: Bezirksgericht), with Regional Courts (Landesgerichte, abbrev.: LG, singular: Landesgericht) serving as courts of appeal and the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof, abbrev.: OGH) serving as the court of last resort. In cases considered particularly grave or technically involved, the Regional Courts serve as courts of first instance and specialized Regional Courts of Appeal (Oberlandesgerichte, abbrev.: OLG, singular: Oberlandesgericht) serve as courts of appeal, the Supreme Court still being the court of last resort.  Unlike with court systems such as that of the United States federal judiciary, parties have a statutory right to appeal. Although access to the Supreme Court has been successively restricted to matters of some importance in recent years, higher courts can generally not simply refuse to review a decision reached by subordinate courts. Note that the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof - OGH), the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof - VfGH) and the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof - VwGH) are three separate high courts, none being senior to the other two. Civil and human rights. Most closely resembling a bill of rights in Austria is the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals of the Kingdoms and Länder represented in the Council of the Realm, a decree issued by Emperor Franz Josef on December 21, 1867 in response to pressure by liberal insurgents.  A very important part of Austria's canon of constitutional civil liberties thus originated as an imperatorial edict predating the current Constitution of Austria by roughly fifty years, the reason being that the framers of the Constitution in 1920 could not agree on a set of civil liberties to include in the constitution proper: as a lowest common denominator, they resorted to this Basic Law of 1867. Since then, other civil liberties have been set out in other constitutional laws, and Austria is party to the European Convention of Human Rights, which, too, has been implemented as a directly applicable constitutional law in Austria. Given the fact that the Constitutional Court has begun to interpret the B-VG's equal treatment clause and other constitutional rights rather broadly since at least the early 1980s, civil rights are, as a general matter, relatively well protected. Further checks and balances. In addition to their legislative capacity, the members of the two houses of parliament have the authority to impeach the president, who is then tried before the Constitutional Court, serving as State Court, or call for a referendum to have the federal president removed from office. Exertion of these emergency powers is a two-step process: first the National Council requests the president to be impeached or subjected to referendum, then the members of the National Council and the Federal Council convene in joint session, thus forming the National Assembly, and decide on the National Council's motion. If a referendum is held, and the President is not removed from office by popular vote, he is automatically considered re-elected for another six-year term (although he may still not serve for more than twelve consecutive years). The National Council will then be dissolved automatically and new general elections must be held. The president may also dissolve the National Council, but only once for the same reason during his term of office. Note that the president does not have the power to veto specific acts of legislation: no matter how vehemently he objects to some particular bill, or believes it to be unconstitutional, all he can actually do is threaten to dismiss the government or dissolve the National Council before the bill is actually passed.  Needless to say, none of these emergency powers have been exercised thus far. Criticism and reform proposals. Probably the most unusual and problematic aspect of Austrian constitutional law is the relative ease with which it can be changed, combined with the fact that a constitutional amendment need not be incorporated into the main text of the B-VG, or for that matter any of the more important parts of the constitutional body, but can be enacted as a separate constitutional act, or even as a simple section within any act, simply designated as ""constitutional"" (Verfassungsbestimmung). In reality, all that is needed is a majority of two-thirds in the National Council. Only in the case of a fundamental change (""Gesamtänderung"") of the constitution a confirmation by referendum is required. Austria's accession to EU in 1995 was considered such a change. Over the years, the Austrian legal system became littered with literally thousands of constitutional provisions, split up over numerous acts. The reason for this was in many cases that the legislature, in particular when the governing coalition possessed a two-thirds majority in the National Council (such as between 1945–1966, 1986–1994, 1995–1999, and again since 2007), laws that were considered ""constitutionally problematic"" were enacted as constitutional laws, effectively protecing them from judicial review by the Constitutional Court. There have even been cases where a provision, that had been previously declared unconstitutional by the competent Constitutional Court, have subsequently been enacted as constitutional laws. Needless to say, the Constitutional Court did and does not like that practice, and has declared that it might, in a not-too-distant future, consider such changes, in their entirety, as ""fundamental change"" to the constitution, which would require a public referendum. From 2003 to 2005, a constitutional convention (""Österreich Konvent"") consisting of representatives of all parties, representatives of all layers of government and many groups of Austrian society have been debating whether and how to reform the constitution. There was no general consensus on a draft for a new constitution, however. Some minor points that were universally agreed upon have yet to be implemented. "
wikipedia-1280017," Fair Packaging and Labeling Act  The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act is a U.S. law that applies to labels on many consumer products. It requires the label to state: The contents statement must include both metric and U.S. customary units.  Passed under Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, the law first took effect on July 1, 1967. The metric labeling requirement was added in 1992 and took effect on February 14, 1994. The law is codified as . There has been an effort by industry threatened by a European Union directive that would force metric-only labeling starting January 1, 2010, to amend the FPLA to allow manufacturers to use metric-only labeling. An amendment to delay indefinitely metric-only labeling was adopted by the European Commission September 10, 2007, approved by the European Parliament November 29, 2007, and by the European Economic and Social Committee December 12, 2007. The E.U. will review this policy again in 2018 and may then maintain the status quo or set a deadline for mandatory metric only.  "
wikipedia-1280042," Timo Maas  Timo Maas (born July 27, 1969, Bückeburg, West Germany) is a German electronic music DJ/producer and remixer. Career. Maas bought his first set of turntables at the age of 17, and played his very first DJ set in 1982 at a party in his friend's home. The beginning of his career consisted mostly of gigs around Germany playing ""Top 40"" records with the occasional techno record sneaked in, but it was to be another 6 years from his debut DJ performance before he would perform his first official all-techno set. In 1992, Maas was introduced to the early German rave scene, and he went on to DJ at many different rave events both in Germany and elsewhere, earning a name in the electronic underground scene. Maas' first record, ""The Final XS"", was released in 1995. His second record release was a collaboration with another producer, Gary D, ""Die Herdplatte"", which was a bigger success than his first. Gary D also gained Maas a residency at Hamburg's famous club, The Tunnel, between 1994 and 1996. Through British contacts Maas played at the Bristol club Lakota. Maas also began to release records through record labels such as Hope Recordings, both under his own name and the alias, Orinoko. Maas has also recorded under many aliases such as Mad Dogs among others together with his manager and friend Leon Alexander. In 2000, Timo Maas began a residency alongside Deep Dish at the New York club, Twilo. Maas first became popular in mainstream dance music through his remix of Azzido Da Bass' ""Doom's Night"", in the wake of which he released ""Music For The Maases Volume 1"", a mix album consisting of many of his previous tracks and remixes. After another mix album called ""Connected"" for Paul Oakenfold's imprint Perfecto, Maas released his own debut studio album ""Loud"" in 2002. The album was produced by German dance music production powerhouse Martin Buttrich (also known for his work with Loco Dice), and featured guest appearances from Kelis and Finley Quaye. A second ""Music For The Maases Volume 2"" was released, again consisting of remixes and new tracks. In 2005, Maas released his second album ""Pictures"", this time featuring guest artists Kelis, Neneh Cherry and Placebo's Brian Molko. Maas has also provided remixes for artists such as Fatboy Slim, Kelis and Madonna. His music has been described as progressive trance, but in reality is more like progressive house. Appearances in media. Maas' ""To Get Down"" track has been widely used in movie soundtracks such as the 2003 remake of ""The Italian Job"", ""Riders"" in 2002, as well as other mediums such as the video game ""FIFA Football 2003"", and a Budweiser beer commercial. Another of his tracks, ""Unite"", appears in the ""FIFA 2004"" soundtrack. A remix of the ""Neighbourhood"" screen music is credited to him on the video game """", whilst the video game ""Wipeout Fusion"" uses the song ""Old School Vibes"" from the album ""Loud"". ""Burnout Revenge"" used the General Midi remix of ""First Day"" for the game's EA Trax. "
wikipedia-1280044," Harmonic tremor  Harmonic tremor describes a long-duration release of seismic energy, with distinct spectral (harmonic) lines, that often precedes or accompanies a volcanic eruption. More generally, a volcanic tremor is a sustained signal that may or may not possess these harmonic spectral features. A harmonic tremor is a sustained release of seismic and/or infrasonic energy typically associated with the underground movement of magma and/or venting of volcanic gases from magma. Being a long-duration continuous signal from a temporally extended source, a volcanic tremor contrasts distinctly with transient sources of seismic radiation, such as tremors that are typically associated with earthquake and explosion. For more info, see the work of Bernard Chouet, a USGS volcanologist who was working at the United States Geological Survey and who first observed a relation between long-period events and an imminent eruption. "
wikipedia-1280053," History of radar  The history of radar starts with experiments by Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century that showed that radio waves were reflected by metallic objects. This possibility was suggested in James Clerk Maxwell's seminal work on electromagnetism. However, it was not until the early 20th century that systems were able to use these principles were becoming widely available, and it was German inventor Christian Hülsmeyer who first used them to build a simple ship detection device intended to help avoid collisions in fog (Reichspatent Nr. 165546). Numerous similar systems were developed over the next two decades. The term ""RADAR"" was coined in 1939 by the United States Signal Corps as it worked to develop new navigation and detection systems being prepared for Naval use. The term is as an acronym for ""radio detection and ranging"". Many today believe that this was a cover for the highly secret technology, but the fact is that it was simply the reapplication of the same acronym that was used by the Signal Corps in their earlier development of radio navigation systems developed for the Signal Corps' then fledgling Army Air Force. The difference between the two was that radio navigation focused on locating a target to navigate to (or away from), while RADAR focused on finding an unknown target. Underneath them both however, the basic technology the Signal Corps was developing was the same.  Thus, a true radar system must both detect and provide range (distance) information for a target. Before 1934, no single system gave this performance; some systems were omni-directional and provided ranging information, while others provided rough directional information but not range. A key development was the use of pulses that were timed to provide ranging, which were sent from large antennas that provided accurate directional information. Combining the two allowed for accurate plotting of targets. In the 1934–1939 period, eight nations developed, independently and in great secrecy, systems of this type: the United States, Great Britain, Germany, the USSR, Japan, the Netherlands, France, and Italy. In addition, Great Britain had shared their basic information with four Commonwealth countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and these countries had also developed indigenous radar systems. During the war, Hungary was added to this list. Progress during the war was rapid and of great importance, probably one of the decisive factors for the victory of the Allies. By the end of hostilities, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, the USSR, and Japan had a wide diversity of land- and sea-based radars as well as small airborne systems. After the war, radar use was widened to numerous fields including: civil aviation, marine navigation, radar guns for police, meteorology and even medicine. Significance. The place of radar in the larger story of science and technology is argued differently by different authors. On the one hand, radar contributed very little to theory, which was largely known since the days of Maxwell and Hertz. Therefore radar did not advance science, but was simply a matter of technology and engineering. Maurice Ponte, one of the developers of radar in France, states: But others point out the immense practical consequences of the development of radar. Far more than the atomic bomb, radar contributed to Allied victory in World War II. Robert Buderi states that it was also the precursor of much modern technology. From a review of his book: Contributors. Heinrich Hertz. In 1887 the German physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) began experimenting with electromagnetic waves in his laboratory. He found that these waves could be transmitted through different types of materials, and were reflected by others, such as conductors and dielectrics. The existence of electromagnetic waves was predicted earlier by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–79), but it was Hertz who first succeeded in generating and detecting what were soon called radio waves. Guglielmo Marconi. The development of the wireless or radio is often attributed to Guglielmo Marconi (1874–1937). Although he was not the first to ""invent"" this technology, it might be said that he was the greatest early promoter of practical radio systems and their applications. In a paper read before the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London on March 3, 1899, Marconi described radio beacon experiments he had conducted in Salisbury Plain. Concerning this lecture, in a 1922 paper he wrote: This paper and a speech presenting the paper to a joint meeting of the Institute of Radio Engineers and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City on June 20, 1922, is often cited as the seminal event which began widespread interest in the development of radar. Christian Hülsmeyer. In 1904 Christian Hülsmeyer (1881–1957) gave public demonstrations in Germany and the Netherlands of the use of radio echoes to detect ships so that collisions could be avoided. His device consisted of a simple spark gap used to generate a signal that was aimed using a dipole antenna with a cylindrical parabolic reflector. When a signal reflected from a ship was picked up by a similar antenna attached to the separate coherer receiver, a bell sounded. During bad weather or fog, the device would be periodically ""spun"" to check for nearby ships. The apparatus detected presence of ships up to 3 km, and Hülsmeyer planned to extend its capability to 10 km. It did not provide range (distance) information, only warning of a nearby object. He patented the device, called the ""telemobiloscope"", but due to lack of interest by the naval authorities the invention was not put into production. Hülsmeyer also received a patent amendment for estimating the range to the ship. Using a vertical scan of the horizon with the ""telemobiloscope"" mounted on a tower, the operator would find the angle at which the return was the most intense and deduce, by simple triangulation, the approximate distance. This is in contrast to the later development of pulsed radar, which determines distance via two-way travel time. Nikola Tesla. One of the hundreds of concepts generated by Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) included principles regarding frequency and power levels for primitive radio-location units. In an interview published in ""Century Illustrated Magazine"", June 1900, Tesla gave the following: In 1917, at the height of World War I, Tesla proposed that radio location techniques might help find submerged submarines with a fluorescent screen indicator. While radar would eventually be capable of detecting submarines on the surface, the required radio frequencies are quickly attenuated in water, making this technique ineffective for detecting submerged submarines. United States. In the United States, both the Navy and Army needed means of remotely locating enemy ships and aircraft. In 1930, both services initiated the development of radio equipment that could meet this need. There was little coordination of these efforts; thus, they will be described separately. United States Navy. In the autumn of 1922, Albert H. Taylor and Leo C. Young at the U.S. Naval Aircraft Radio Laboratory were conducting communication experiments when they noticed that a wooden ship in the Potomac River was interfering with their signals. They prepared a memorandum suggesting that this might be used for ship detection in a harbor defense, but their suggestion was not taken up. In 1930, Lawrence A. Hyland working with Taylor and Young, now at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., used a similar arrangement of radio equipment to detect a passing aircraft. This led to a proposal and patent for using this technique for detecting ships and aircraft. A simple wave-interference apparatus can detect the presence of an object, but it cannot determine its location or velocity. That had to await the invention of pulsed radar, and later, additional encoding techniques to extract this information from a CW signal. When Taylor's group at the NRL were unsuccessful in getting interference radio accepted as a detection means, Young suggested trying pulsing techniques. This would also allow the direct determination of range to the target. In 1924, Hyland and Young had built such a transmitter for Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington for successfully measuring the height of the ionosphere. Robert Morris Page was assigned by Taylor to implement Young's suggestion. Page designed a transmitter operating at 60 MHz and pulsed 10 μs in duration and 90 μs between pulses. In December 1934, the apparatus was used to detect a plane at a distance of one mile (1.6 km) flying up and down the Potomac. Although the detection range was small and the indications on the oscilloscope monitor were almost indistinct, it demonstrated the basic concept of a pulsed radar system. Based on this, Page, Taylor, and Young are usually credited with building and demonstrating the world’s first true radar. An important subsequent development by Page was the duplexer, a device that allowed the transmitter and receiver to use the same antenna without overwhelming or destroying the sensitive receiver circuitry. This also solved the problem associated with synchronization of separate transmitter and receiver antennas which is critical to accurate position determination of long-range targets. The experiments with pulsed radar were continued, primarily in improving the receiver for handling the short pulses. In June 1936, the NRL's first prototype radar system, now operating at 28.6 MHz, was demonstrated to government officials, successfully tracking an aircraft at distances up to . Their radar was based on low frequency signals, at least by today's standards, and thus required large antennas, making it impractical for ship or aircraft mounting. Antenna size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency; therefore, the operating frequency of the system was increased to 200 MHz, allowing much smaller antennas. The frequency of 200 MHz was the highest possible with existing transmitter tubes and other components. The new system was successfully tested at the NRL in April 1937, That same month, the first sea-borne testing was conducted. The equipment was temporarily installed on the USS ""Leary"", with a Yagi antenna mounted on a gun barrel for sweeping the field of view. Based on success of the sea trials, the NRL further improved the system. Page developed the ring oscillator, allowing multiple output tubes and increasing the pulse-power to 15 kW in 5-µs pulses. A 20-by-23 ft (6 x 7 m), stacked-dipole “bedspring” antenna was used. In laboratory test during 1938, the system, now designated XAF, detected planes at ranges up to . It was installed on the battleship USS ""New York"" for sea trials starting in January 1939, and became the first operational radio detection and ranging set in the U.S. fleet. In May 1939, a contract was awarded to RCA for production. Designated CXAM, deliveries started in May 1940. The acronym RADAR was coined from ""Radio Detection And Ranging"" as a cover reference to this highly secret technology. One of the first CXAM systems was placed aboard the USS ""California"", a battleship that was sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. United States Army. As the Great Depression started, economic conditions led the U.S. Army Signal Corps to consolidate its widespread laboratory operations to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. On June 30, 1930, these were designated the Signal Corps Laboratories (SCL) and Lt. Colonel (Dr.) William R. Blair was appointed the SCL Director. Among other activities, the SCL was made responsible for research in the detection of aircraft by acoustical and infrared radiation means. Blair had performed his doctoral research in the interaction of electromagnet waves with solid materials, and naturally gave attention to this type of detection. Initially, attempts were made to detect infrared radiation, either from the heat of aircraft engines or as reflected from large searchlights with infrared filters, as well as from radio signals generated by the engine ignition. Some success was made in the infrared detection, but little was accomplished using radio. In 1932, progress at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) on radio interference for aircraft detection was passed on to the Army. While it does not appear that any of this information was used by Blair, the SCL did undertake a systematic survey of what was then known throughout the world about the methods of generating, modulating, and detecting radio signals in the microwave region. The SCL's first definitive efforts in radio-based target detection started in 1934 when the Chief of the Army Signal Corps, after seeing a microwave demonstration by RCA, suggested that radio-echo techniques be investigated. The SCL called this technique radio position-finding (RPF). Based on the previous investigations, the SCL first tried microwaves. During 1934 and 1935, tests of microwave RPF equipment resulted in Doppler-shifted signals being obtained, initially at only a few hundred feet distance and later greater than a mile. These tests involved a bi-static arrangement, with the transmitter at one end of the signal path and the receiver at the other, and the reflecting target passing through or near the path. Blair was evidently not aware of the success of a pulsed system at the NRL in December 1934. In an internal 1935 note, Blair had commented: In 1936, W. Delmar Hershberger, SCL’s Chief Engineer at that time, started a modest project in pulsed microwave transmission. Lacking success with microwaves, Hershberger visited the NRL (where he had earlier worked) and saw a demonstration of their pulsed set. Back at the SCL, he and Robert H. Noyes built an experimental apparatus using a 75 watt, 110 MHz (2.73 m) transmitter with pulse modulation and a receiver patterned on the one at the NRL. A request for project funding was turned down by the War Department, but $75,000 for support was diverted from a previous appropriation for a communication project. In October 1936, Paul E. Watson became the SCL Chief Engineer and led the project. A field setup near the coast was made with the transmitter and receiver separated by a mile. On December 14, 1936, the experimental set detected at up to range aircraft flying in and out of New York City. Work then began on a prototype system. Ralph I. Cole headed receiver work and William S. Marks lead transmitter improvements. Separate receivers and antennas were used for azimuth and elevation detection. Both receiving and the transmitting antennas used large arrays of dipole wires on wooden frames. The system output was intended to aim a searchlight. The first demonstration of the full set was made on the night of May 26, 1937. A bomber was detected and then illuminated by the searchlight. The observers included the Secretary of War, Henry A. Woodring; he was so impressed that the next day orders were given for the full development of the system. Congress gave an appropriation of $250,000. The frequency was increased to 200 MHz (1.5 m). The transmitter used 16 tubes in a ring oscillator circuit (developed at the NRL), producing about 75 kW peak power. Major James C. Moore was assigned to head the complex electrical and mechanical design of lobe switching antennas. Engineers from Western Electric and Westinghouse were brought in to assist in the overall development. Designated SCR-268, a prototype was successfully demonstrated in late 1938 at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Production of SCR-268 sets was started by Western Electric in 1939, and it entered service in early 1941. Even before the SCR-268 entered service, it had been greatly improved. In a project led by Major (Dr.) Harold A. Zahl, two new configurations evolved – the SCR-270 (mobile) and the SCR-271 (fixed-site). Operation at 106 MHz (2.83 m) was selected, and a single water-cooled tube provided 8 kW (100 kW pulsed) output power. Westinghouse received a production contract, and started deliveries near the end of 1940. The Army deployed five of the first SCR-270 sets around the island of Oahu in Hawaii. At 7:02 on the morning of December 7, 1941, one of these radars detected a flight of aircraft at a range of due north. The observation was passed on to an aircraft warning center where it was misidentified as a flight of U.S. bombers known to be approaching from the mainland. The alarm went unheeded, and at 7:48, the Japanese aircraft first struck at Pearl Harbor. United Kingdom. In 1915, Robert Watson Watt joined the Meteorological Office as a meteorologist, working at an outstation at Aldershot in Hampshire. Over the next 20 years, he studied atmospheric phenomena and developed the use of radio signals generated by lightning strikes to map out the position of thunderstorms. The difficulty in pinpointing the direction of these fleeting signals led to the use of rotatable directional antennas, and in 1923 the use of oscilloscopes in order to display the signals. An operator would periodically rotate the antenna and look for ""spikes"" on the oscilloscope to find the direction of a storm. The operation eventually moved to the outskirts of Slough in Berkshire, and in 1927 formed the Radio Research Station (RRS), Slough, an entity under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). Watson Watt was appointed the RRS Superintendent. As war clouds gathered over Great Britain, the likelihood of air raids and the threat of invasion by air and sea drove a major effort in applying science and technology to defence. In November 1934, the Air Ministry established the Committee for Scientific Survey of Air Defence (CSSAD) with the official function of considering ""how far recent advances in scientific and technical knowledge can be used to strengthen the present methods of defence against hostile aircraft."" Commonly called the “Tizard Committee” after its Chairman, Sir Henry Tizard, this group had a profound influence on technical developments in Great Britain. H. E. Wimperis, Director of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry and a member of the Tizard Committee, had read about Nikola Tesla's claim of inventing a 'death ray.' Watson Watt, Superintendent of the RRS, Slough, was now well established as an authority in the field of radio, and in January 1935, Wimperis contacted him asking if radio might be used for such a device. After discussing this with his scientific assistant, Arnold F. 'Skip' Wilkins, Watson Watt wrote back that this was unlikely, but added the following comment: ""Attention is being turned to the still difficult, but less unpromising, problem of radio detection and numerical considerations on the method of detection by reflected radio waves will be submitted when required."" Over the following several weeks, Wilkins considered the radio detection problem. He outlined an approach and backed it with detailed calculations of necessary transmitter power, reflection characteristics of an aircraft, and needed receiver sensitivity. Watson Watt sent this information to the Air Ministry on February 12, 1935, in a secret report titled ""The Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods."" Reflection of radio signals was critical to the proposed technique, and the Air Ministry asked if this could be proven. To test this, Wilkins set up receiving equipment in a field near Upper Stowe, Northamptonshire. On February 26, 1935, a Handley Page Heyford bomber flew along a path between the receiving station and the transmitting towers of a BBC shortwave station in nearby Daventry. The aircraft reflected the 6 MHz (49 m) BBC signal, and this was readily detected by Doppler-beat interference at ranges up to . This convincing test, known as the ""Daventry Experiment"", was witnessed by a representative from the Air Ministry, and led to the immediate authorization to build a full demonstration system. Based on pulsed transmission as used for probing the ionosphere. a preliminary system was designed and built at the RRS by the team. Their existing transmitter had a peak power of about 1 kW, and Wilkins had estimated that 100 kW would be needed. Edward George Bowen was added to the team to design and build such a transmitter. Bowens’ transmitter operated at 6 MHz (50 m), had a pulse-repetition rate of 25 Hz, a pulse width of 25 μs, and approached the desired power. Orfordness, a narrow, peninsula in Suffolk along the coast of the North Sea, was selected as the test site. Here the equipment would be openly operated in the guise of an ionospheric monitoring station. In mid-May, 1935, the equipment was moved to Orfordness. Six wooden towers were erected, two for stringing the transmitting antenna, and four for corners of crossed receiving antennas. In June, general testing of the equipment began. On June 17, the first target was detected—a Supermarine Scapa flying boat at range. It is historically correct that on June 17, 1935, radio-based detection and ranging was first demonstrated in Great Britain. Watson Watt, Wilkins, and Bowen are generally credited with initiating what would later be called radar in this nation. In December 1935, the British Treasury appropriated £60,000 for a five-station system called Chain Home (CH), covering approaches to the Thames Estuary. The secretary of the Tizard Committee, Albert Percival Rowe, coined the acronym RDF as a cover for the work, meaning Range and Direction Finding but suggesting the already well-known Radio Direction Finding. In 1940 John Randall and Harry Boot developed the Cavity magnetron which made ten-centimetre radar a reality. This device, the size of a small dinner plate, could be carried easily on aircraft and the short wavelength meant that the antenna would also be small and hence suitable for mounting on aircraft. The short wavelength and high power made it very effective at spotting submarines from the air. Air Ministry. In March 1936 the work at Orfordness was moved to Bawdsey Manor, nearby on the mainland. Until this time, the work had officially still been under the DSIR, but was now transferred to the Air Ministry. At the new Bawdsey Research Station, the CH equipment was assembled as a prototype. There were equipment problems when the Royal Air Force (RAF) first exercised the prototype station in September 1936. These were cleared by the next April, and the Air Ministry started plans for a larger network of stations.  Initial hardware at CH stations was as follows: The transmitter operated on four pre-selected frequencies between 20 and 55 MHz, adjustable within 15 seconds, and delivered a peak power of 200 kW. The pulse duration was adjustable between 5 to 25 μs, with a repetition rate selectable as either 25 or 50 Hz. For synchronization of all CH transmitters, the pulse generator was locked to the 50 Hz of the British power grid. Four steel towers supported transmitting antennas, and four wooden towers supported cross-dipole arrays at three different levels. A goniometer was used to improve the directional accuracy from the multiple receiving antennas. By the summer of 1937, 20 initial CH stations were in check-out operation. A major RAF exercise was performed before the end of the year, and was such a success that £10,000,000 was appropriated by the Treasury for an eventual full chain of coastal stations. At the start of 1938, the RAF took over control of all CH stations, and the network began regular operations. In May 1938, Rowe replaced Watson Watt as Superintendent at Bawdsey. In addition to the work on CH and successor systems, there was now major work in airborne RDF equipment. This was led by E. G. Bowen and centered on 200-MHz (1.5 m) sets. The higher frequency allowed smaller antennas, appropriate for aircraft installation. From the initiation of RDF work at Orfordness, the Air Ministry had kept the British Army and the Royal Navy generally informed; this led to both of these forces having their own RDF developments. British Army. In 1931, at the Woolwich Research Station of the Army’s Signals Experimental Establishment (SEE), W. A. S. Butement and P. E. Pollard had examined pulsed 600 MHz (50-cm) signals for detection of ships. Although they prepared a memorandum on this subject and performed preliminary experiments, for undefined reasons the War Office did not give it consideration. As the Air Ministry’s work on RDF progressed, Colonel Peter Worlledge of the Royal Engineer and Signals Board met with Watson Watt and was briefed on the RDF equipment and techniques being developed at Orfordness. His report, “The Proposed Method of Aeroplane Detection and Its Prospects,” led the SEE to set up an “Army Cell” at Bawdsey in October 1936. This was under E. Talbot Paris and the staff included Butement and Pollard. The Cell’s work emphasize two general types of RDF equipment: gun-laying (GL) systems for assisting anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, and coastal- defense (CD) systems for directing coastal artillery and defense of Army bases overseas. Pollard led the first project, a gun-laying RDF code-named Mobile Radio Unit (MRU). This truck-mounted system was designed a small version of a CH station. It operated at 23 MHz (13 m) with a power of 300 kW. A single tower supported a transmitting antenna, as well as two receiving antennas set orthogonally for estimating the signal bearing. In February 1937, a developmental unit detected an aircraft at 60 m (96 km) range. The Air Ministry also adopted this system as a mobile auxiliary to the CH system. In early 1938, Butement started the development of a CD system based on Bowen’s evolving 200-MHz (1.5-m) airborne sets. The transmitter had a 400 Hz pulse rate, a 2-μs pulse width, and 50 kW power (later increased to 150 kW). Although many of Bowen’s transmitter and receiver components were used, the system would not be airborne so there were no limitations on antenna size. Primary credit for introducing beamed RDF systems in Great Britain must be given to Butement. For the CD, he developed a large dipole array, high and wide, giving much narrower beams and higher gain. This could be rotated at a speed up to 1.5 revolutions per minute. For greater directional accuracy, lobe switching on the receiving antennas was adopted. As a part of this development, he formulated the first – at least in Great Britain – mathematical relationship that would later become well known as the “radar range equation.” By May 1939, the CD RDF could detect aircraft flying as low as and at a range of . With an antenna above sea level, it could determine the range of a 2,000-ton ship at and with an angular accuracy of as little as a quarter of a degree. Royal Navy. Although the Royal Navy maintained close contact with the Air Ministry work at Bawdsey, they chose to establish their own RDF development at the Experimental Department of His Majesty’s Signal School (HMSS) in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on the south coast. The HMSS started RDF work in September 1935. Initial efforts, under R. F. Yeo, were in wavelengths ranging between 75 MHz (4 m) and 1.2 GHz (25 cm). All of the work was under the utmost secrecy; it could not even be discussed with other scientists and engineers at Portsmouth. A 75 MHz range-only set was eventually developed and designated Type 79X. Basic tests were done using a training ship, but the operation was unsatisfactory. In August 1937, the RDF development at the HMSS changed, with many of their best researchers brought into the activity. John D. S. Rawlinson was made responsible for improving the Type 79X. To increase the efficiency, he decreased the frequency to 43 MHz (7 m). Designated Type 79Y, it had separate, stationary transmitting and receiving antennas. Prototypes of the Type 79Y air-warning system were successfully tested at sea in early 1938. The detection range on aircraft was between 30 and 50 mi (48 and 80 km), depending on height. The systems were then placed into service in August on the cruiser HMS ""Sheffield"" and in October on the battleship HMS ""Rodney"". These were the first vessels in the Royal Navy with RDF systems. Germany. A radio-based device for remotely indicating the presence of ships was built in Germany by Christian Hülsmeyer in 1904. Often referred to as the first radar system, this did not directly measure the range (distance) to the target, and thus did not meet the criteria to be given this name. Over the following three decades in Germany, a number of radio-based detection systems were developed but none were true radars. This situation changed before World War II. Developments in three leading industries are described. GEMA. In the early 1930s, physicist Rudolf Kühnhold, Scientific Director at the ""Kriegsmarine"" (German Navy) ""Nachrichtenmittel-Versuchsanstalt"" (NVA—Experimental Institute of Communication Systems) in Kiel, was attempting to improve the acoustical methods of underwater detection of ships. He concluded that the desired accuracy in measuring distance to targets could be attained only by using pulsed electromagnetic waves. During 1933, Kühnhold first attempted to test this concept with a transmitting and receiving set that operated in the microwave region at 13.5 cm (2.22 GHz). The transmitter used a Barkhausen-Kurz tube (the first microwave generator) that produced only 0.1 watt. Unsuccessful with this, he asked for assistance from Paul-Günther Erbslöh and Hans-Karl Freiherr von Willisen, amateur radio operators who were developing a VHF system for communications. They enthusiastically agreed, and in January 1934, formed a company, ""Gesellschaft für Elektroakustische und Mechanische Apparate"" (GEMA), for the effort. From the start, the firm was always called simply GEMA. Work on a ""Funkmessgerät für Untersuchung"" (radio measuring device for reconnaissance) began in earnest at GEMA. Hans Hollmann and Theodor Schultes, both affiliated with the prestigious Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin, were added as consultants. The first apparatus used a split-anode magnetron purchased from Philips in the Netherlands. This provided about 70 W at 50 cm (600 MHz), but suffered from frequency instability. Hollmann built a regenerative receiver and Schultes developed Yagi antennas for transmitting and receiving. In June 1934, large vessels passing through the Kiel Harbor were detected by Doppler-beat interference at a distance of about . In October, strong reflections were observed from an aircraft that happened to fly through the beam; this opened consideration of targets other than ships. Kühnhold then shifted the GEMA work to a pulse-modulated system. A new 50 cm (600 MHz) Philips magnetron with better frequency stability was used. It was modulated with 2- μs pulses at a PRF of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was an array of 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative receiver used Acorn tubes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device (a duplexer), shut the receiver input when the transmitter pulsed. A Braun tube (a CRT) was used for displaying the range. The equipment was first tested at a NVA site at the Lübecker Bay near Pelzerhaken. During May 1935, it detected returns from woods across the bay at a range of . It had limited success, however, in detecting a research ship, ""Welle"", only a short distance away. The receiver was then rebuilt, becoming a super-regenerative set with two intermediate-frequency stages. With this improved receiver, the system readily tracked vessels at up to range. In September 1935, a demonstration was given to the Commander-in-Chief of the ""Kriegsmarine"". The system performance was excellent; the range was read off the Braun tube with a tolerance of 50 meters (less than 1 percent variance), and the lobe switching allowed a directional accuracy of 0.1 degree. Historically, this marked the first naval vessel equipped with radar. Although this apparatus was not put into production, GEMA was funded to develop similar systems operating around 50 cm (500 MHz). These became the Seetakt for the ""Kriegsmarine"" and the Freya for the ""Luftwaffe"" (German Air Force). Kühnhold remained with the NVA but also consulted with GEMA. He is considered by many in Germany as the Father of Radar. During 1933-6, Hollmann wrote the first comprehensive treatise on microwaves, ""Physik und Technik der ultrakurzen Wellen"" (Physics and Technique of Ultrashort Waves), Springer 1938. Telefunken. In 1933, when Kühnhold at the NVA was first experimenting with microwaves, he had sought information from Telefunken on microwave tubes. (Telefunken was the largest supplier of radio products in Germany) There, Wilhelm Tolmé Runge had told him that no vacuum tubes were available for these frequencies. In fact, Runge was already experimenting with high-frequency transmitters and had Telefunken’s tube department working on cm-wavelength devices. In the summer of 1935, Runge, now Director of Telefunken’s Radio Research Laboratory, initiated an internally funded project in radio-based detection. Using Barkhausen-Kurz tubes, a 50 cm (600 MHz) receiver and 0.5-W transmitter were built. With the antennas placed flat on the ground some distance apart, Runge arranged for an aircraft to fly overhead and found that the receiver gave a strong Doppler-beat interference signal. Runge, now with Hans Hollmann as a consultant, continued in developing a 1.8 m (170 MHz) system using pulse-modulation. Wilhelm Stepp developed a transmit-receive device (a duplexer) for allowing a common antenna. Stepp also code-named the system ""Darmstadt"" after his home town, starting the practice in Telefunken of giving the systems names of cities. The system, with only a few watts transmitter power, was first tested in February 1936, detecting an aircraft at about distance. This led the ""Luftwaffe"" to fund the development of a 50 cm (600 MHz) gun-laying system, the ""Würzburg"". Lorenz. Since before the First World War, Standard Elektrik Lorenz had been the main supplier of communication equipment for the German military and was the main rival of Telefunken. In late 1935, when Lorenz found that Runge at Telefunken was doing research in radio-based detection equipment, they started a similar activity under Gottfried Müller. A pulse-modulated set called ""Einheit für Abfragung"" (DFA - Device for Detection) was built. It used a type DS-310 tube (similar to the Acorn) operating at 70 cm (430 MHz) and about 1 kW power, it had identical transmitting and receiving antennas made with rows of half-wavelength dipoles backed by a reflecting screen.  In early 1936, initial experiments gave reflections from large buildings at up to about . The power was doubled by using two tubes, and in mid-1936, the equipment was set up on cliffs near Kiel, and good detections of ships at and aircraft at were attained.  The success of this experimental set was reported to the ""Kriegsmarine"", but they showed no interest; they were already fully engaged with GEMA for similar equipment. Also, because of extensive agreements between Lorenz and many foreign countries, the naval authorities had reservations concerning the company handling classified work. The DFA was then demonstrated to the ""Heer"" (German Army), and they contracted with Lorenz for developing ""Kurfürst"" (Elector), a system for supporting ""Flugzeugabwehrkanone"" (Flak, anti-aircraft guns). USSR. In 1895, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, a physics instructor at the Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter and demonstrated the first radio communication set in Russia. During 1897, while testing this in communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation. In a few years following the 1917 Russian Revolution and the establishment the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union) in 1924, Germany’s ""Luftwaffe"" had aircraft capable of penetrating deep into Soviet territory. Thus, the detection of aircraft at night or above clouds was of great interest to the ""Voiska Protivo-vozdushnoi oborony"" (PVO, Air Defense Forces) of the ""Raboche-Krest'yanskaya Krasnaya Armiya"" (RKKA, Workers’–Peasants’ Red Army). The PVO depended on optical devices for locating targets, and had physicist Pavel K. Oshchepkov conducting research in possible improvement of these devices. In June 1933, Oshchepkov changed his research from optics to radio techniques and started the development of a ""razvedyvlatl’naya elektromagnitnaya stantsiya"" (reconnaissance electromagnetic station). In a short time, Oshchepkov was made responsible for a PVO ""experino-tekknicheskii sektor"" (technical expertise sector) devoted to ""radiolokatory"" (radio-location) techniques as well as heading a Special Construction Bureau (SCB) in Leningrad (formerly St. Petersberg). Radio-location beginnings. The ""Glavnoe artilkeriisko upravlenie"" (GAU, Main Artillery Administration) was considered the “brains” of the Red Army. It not only had competent engineers and physicists on its central staff, but also had a number of scientific research institutes. Thus, the GAU was also assigned the aircraft detection problem, and Lt. Gen. M. M. Lobanov was placed in charge. After examining existing optical and acoustical equipment, Lobanov also turned to radio-location techniques. For this he approached the ""Tsentral’naya radiolaboratoriya"" (TsRL, Central Radio Laboratory) in Leningrad. Here, Yu. K. Korovin was conducting research on VHF communications, and had built a 50 cm (600 MHz), 0.2 W transmitter using a Barkhausen-Kurz tube. For testing the concept, Korovin arranged the transmitting and receiving antennas along the flight path of an aircraft. On January 3, 1934, a Doppler signal was received by reflections from the aircraft at some 600 m range and 100–150 m altitude. For further research in detection methods, a major conference on this subject was arranged for the PVO by the ""Rossiiskaya Akademiya Nauk"" (RAN, Russian Academy of Sciences). The conference was held in Leningrad in mid-January, 1934, and chaired by Abram Fedorovich Ioffe, Director of the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI). Ioffe was generally considered the top Russian physicist of his time. All types of detection techniques were discussed, but radio-location received the greatest attention. To distribute the conference findings to a wider audience, the proceedings were published the following month in a journal. This included all of the then-existing information on radio-location in the USSR, available (in Russian language) to researchers in this field throughout the world. Recognizing the potential value of radio-location to the military, the GAU made a separate agreement with the Leningrad Electro-Physics Institute (LEPI), for a radio-location system. This technical effort was led by B. K. Shembel. The LEPI had built a transmitter and receiver to study the radio-reflection characteristics of various materials and targets. Shemlbel readily made this into an experimental bi-static radio-location system called ""Bistro"" (Rapid). The ""Bistro"" transmitter, operating at 4.7 m (64 MHz), produced near 200 W and was frequency-modulated by a 1 kHz tone. A fixed transmitting antenna gave a broad coverage of what was called a ""radiozkzn"" (radio screen). A regenerative receiver, located some distance from the transmitter, had a dipole antenna mounted on a hand-driven reciprocating mechanism. An aircraft passing into the screened zone would reflect the radiation, and the receiver would detect the Doppler-interference beat between the transmitted and reflected signals.  ""Bistro"" was first tested during the summer of 1934. With the receiver up to 11 km away from the transmitter, the set could only detect an aircraft entering a screen at about range and under 1,000 m. With improvements, it was believed to have a potential range of 75 km, and five sets were ordered in October for field trials. ""Bistro"" is often cited as the USSR’s first radar system; however, it was incapable of directly measuring range and thus could not be so classified. LEPI and TsRL were both made a part of ""Nauchno-issledovatel institut-9"" (NII-9, Scientific Research Institute #9), a new GAU organization opened in Leningrad in 1935. Mikhail A. Bonch-Bruyevich, a renowned radio physicist previously with TsRL and the University of Leningrad, was named the NII-9 Scientific Director. Research on magnetrons began at Kharkov University in Ukraine during the mid-1920s. Before the end of the decade this had resulted in publications with worldwide distribution, such as the German journal ""Annalen der Physik"" (""Annals of Physics""). Based on this work, Ioffe recommended that a portion of the LEPI be transferred to the city of Kharkov, resulting in the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology (LIPT) being formed in 1930. Within the LIPT, the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Oscillations (LEMO), headed by Abram A. Slutskin, continued with magnetron development. Led by Aleksandr S. Usikov, a number of advanced segmented-anode magnetrons evolved. (It is noted that these and other early magnetrons developed in the USSR suffered from frequency instability, a problem in their use in Soviet radar systems.) In 1936, one of Usikov’s magnetrons producing about 7 W at 18 cm (1.7 GHz) was used by Shembel at the NII-9 as a transmitter in a ""radioiskatel"" (radio-seeker) called ""Burya"" (Storm). Operating similarly to ""Bistro"", the range of detection was about 10 km, and provided azimuth and elevation coordinates estimated to within 4 degrees. No attempts were made to make this intro a pulsed system, thus, it could not provide range and was not qualified to be classified as a radar. It was, however, the first microwave radio-detection system. While work by Shembel and Bonch-Bruyevich on continuous-wave systems was taking place at NII-9, Oshehepkov at the SCB and V. V. Tsimbalin of Ioffe’s LPTI were pursuing a pulsed system. In 1936, they built a radio-location set operating at 4 m (75 MHz) with a peak-power of about 500 W and a 10-μs pulse duration. Before the end of the year, tests using separated transmitting and receiving sites resulted in an aircraft being detected at 7 km. In April 1937, with the peak-pulse power increased to 1 kW and the antenna separation also increased, test showed a detection range of near 17 km at a height of 1.5 km. Although a pulsed system, it was not capable of directly providing range – the technique of using pulses for determining range had not yet been developed. Pre-war radio location systems. In June 1937, all of the work in Leningrad on radio-location suddenly stopped. The infamous Great Purge of dictator Joseph Stalin swept over the military high commands and its supporting scientific community. The PVO chief was executed. Oshchepkov, charged with “high crime,” was sentenced to 10 years at a Gulag penal labor camp. NII-9 as an organization was saved, but Shenbel was dismissed and Bonch-Bruyevich was named the new director. The ""Nauchnoissledovatel'skii ispytalel'nyi institut svyazi RKKA"" (NIIIS-KA, Scientific Research Institute of Signals of the Red Army), had initially opposed research in radio-location, favoring instead acoustical techniques. However, this portion of the Red Army gained power as a result of the Great Purge, and did an about face, pressing hard for speedy development of radio-location systems. They took over Oshchepkov’s laboratory and were made responsible for all existing and future agreements for research and factory production. Writing later about the Purge and subsequent effects, General Lobanov commented that it led to the development being placed under a single organization, and the rapid reorganization of the work. At Oshchepkov’s former laboratory, work with the 4 m (75 MHz) pulsed-transmission system was continued by A. I. Shestako. Through pulsing, the transmitter produced a peak power of 1 kW, the highest level thus far generated. In July 1938, a fixed-position, bi-static experimental system detected an aircraft at about 30 km range at heights of 500 m, and at 95 km range, for high-flying targets at 7.5 km altitude. The system was still incapable of directly determining the range. The project was then taken up by Ioffe’s LPTI, resulting in the development of a mobile system designated ""Redut"" (Redoubt). An arrangement of new transmitter tubes was used, giving near 50 kW peak-power with a 10 μs pulse-duration. Yagi antennas were adopted for both transmitting and receiving. The ""Redut"" was first field tested in October 1939, at a site near Sevastopol, a port in Ukraine on the coast of the Black Sea. This testing was in part to show the NKKF (Soviet Navy) the value of early-warning radio-location for protecting strategic ports. With the equipment on a cliff about 160 meters above sea level, a flying boat was detected at ranges up to 150 km. The Yagi antennas were spaced about 1,000 meters; thus, close coordination was required to aim them in synchronization. An improved version of the Redut, the Redut-K, was developed by Aksel Berg in 1940 and placed aboard the light cruiser ""Molotov"" in April 1941. ""Molotov"" became the first Soviet warship equipped with radar. At the NII-9 under Bonch-Bruyevich, scientists developed two types of very advanced microwave generators. In 1938, a linear-beam, velocity-modulated vacuum tube (a klystron) was developed by Nikolay Devyatkov, based on designs from Kharkpv. This device produced about 25 W at 15–18 cm (2.0–1.7 GHz) and was later used in experimental systems. Devyatkov followed this with a simpler, single-resonator device (a reflex klystron). At this same time, D. E. Malyarov and N. F. Alekseyev were building a series of magnetrons, also based on designs from Kharkov; the best of these produced 300 W at 9 cm (3 GHz).  Also at NII-9, D. S. Stogov was placed in charge of the improvements to the ""Bistro"" system. Redesignated as ""Reven"" (Rhubarb), it was tested in August 1938, but was only marginally better than the predecessor. With additional minor operational improvements, it was made into a mobile system called ""Radio Ulavlivatel Samoletov"" (RUS, Radio Catcher of Aircraft), soon designated as ""RUS-1"". This continuous-wave, bi-static system had a truck-mounted transmitter operating at 4.7 m (64 MHz) and two truck-mounted receivers. Although the ""RUS-1"" transmitter was in a cabin on the rear of a truck, the antenna had to be strung between external poles anchored to the ground. A second truck carrying the electrical generator and other equipment was backed against the transmitter truck. Two receivers were used, each in a truck-mounted cabin with a dipole antenna on a rotatable pole extended overhead. In use, the receiver trucks were placed about 40 km apart; thus, with two positions, it would be possible to make a rough estimate of the range by triangulation on a map. The ""RUS-1"" system was tested and put into production in 1939, then entered service in 1940, becoming the first deployed radio-location system in the Red Army. A total of about 45 ""RUS-1"" systems were built at the Svetlana Factory in Leningrad before the end of 1941, and deployed along the western USSR borders and in the Far East. Without direct ranging capability, however, the military found the ""RUS-1"" to be of little value. Even before the demise of efforts in Leningrad, the NIIIS-KA had contracted with the UIPT in Kharkov to investigate a pulsed radio-location system for anti-aircraft applications. This led the LEMO, in March 1937, to start an internally funded project with the code name ""Zenit"" (a popular football team at the time). The transmitter development was led by Usikov, supplier of the magnetron used earlier in the ""Burya"". For the ""Zenit"", Usikov used a 60 cm (500 MHz) magnetron pulsed at 10–20 μs duration and providing 3 kW pulsed power, later increased to near 10 kW. Semion Braude led the development of a superheterodyne receiver using a tunable magnetron as the local oscillator. The system had separate transmitting and receiving antennas set about 65 m apart, built with dipoles backed by 3-meter parabolic reflectors.  ""Zenit"" was first tested in October 1938. In this, a medium-sized bomber was detected at a range of 3 km. The testing was observed by the NIIIS-KA and found to be sufficient for starting a contracted effort. An agreement was made in May 1939, specifying the required performance and calling for the system to be ready for production by 1941. The transmitter was increased in power, the antennas had selsens added to allow them to track, and the receiver sensitivity was improved by using an RCA 955 acorn triode as the local oscillator. A demonstration of the improved ""Zenit"" was given in September 1940. In this, it was shown that the range, altitude, and azimuth of an aircraft flying at heights between 4,000 and 7,000 meters could be determined at up to 25 km distance. The time required for these measurements, however, was about 38 seconds, far too long for use by anti-aircraft batteries. Also, with the antennas aimed at a low angle, there was a dead zone of some distance caused by interference from ground-level reflections. While this performance was not satisfactory for immediate gun-laying applications, it was the first full three-coordinate radio-location system in the Soviet Union and showed the way for future systems. Work at the LEMO continued on ""Zenit"", particularly in converting it into a single-antenna system designated ""Rubin"". This effort, however, was disrupted by the invasion of the USSR by Germany in June 1941. In a short while, the development activities at Kharkov were ordered to be evacuated into the Far East. The research efforts in Leningrad were similarly dispersed. After eight years of effort by highly qualified physicists and engineers, the USSR entered World War II without a fully developed and fielded radar system. Japan. As a seafaring nation, Japan had an early interest in wireless (radio) communications. The first known use of wireless telegraphy in warfare at sea was by the Imperial Japanese Navy, in defeating the Russian Imperial Fleet in 1904. There was an early interest in equipment for radio direction-finding, for use in both navigation and military surveillance. The Imperial Navy developed an excellent receiver for this purpose in 1921, and soon most of the Japanese warships had this equipment. In the two decades between the two World Wars, radio technology in Japan made advancements on a par with that in the western nations. There were often impediments, however, in transferring these advancements into the military. For a long time, the Japanese had believed they had the best fighting capability of any military force in the world. The military leaders, who were then also in control of the government, sincerely felt that the weapons, aircraft, and ships that they had built were fully sufficient and, with these as they were, the Japanese Army and Navy were invincible. In 1936, Japan joined Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a Tripartite Pact. Technology background. Radio engineering was strong in Japan’s higher education institutions, especially the Imperial (government-financed) universities. This included undergraduate and graduate study, as well as academic research in this field. Special relationships were established with foreign universities and institutes, particularly in Germany, with Japanese teachers and researchers often going overseas for advanced study. The academic research tended toward the improvement of basic technologies, rather than their specific applications. There was considerable research in high-frequency and high-power oscillators, such as the magnetron, but the application of these devices was generally left to industrial and military researchers. One of Japan’s best-known radio researchers in the 1920s-30s era was Professor Hidetsugu Yagi. After graduate study in Germany, England, and America, Yagi joined Tohoku University where his research centered on antennas and oscillators for high-frequency communications. A summary of the radio research work at Tohoku University was contained in a 1928 seminal paper by Yagi. Jointly with Shintaro Uda, one Yagi’s first doctoral students, a radically new antenna emerged. It had a number of parasitic elements (directors and reflectors) and would come to be known as the Yagi-Uda or Yagi antenna. A U.S. patent, issued in May 1932, was assigned to RCA. To this day, this is the most widely used directional antenna worldwide. The cavity magnetron was also of interest to Yagi. This HF (~10-MHz) device had been invented in 1921 by Albert W. Hull at General Electric, and Yagi was convinced that it could function in the VHF or even the UHF region. In 1927, Kinjiro Okabe, another of Yagi’s early doctoral students, developed a split-anode device that ultimately generated oscillations at wavelengths down to about 12 cm (2.5 GHz). Researchers at other Japanese universities and institutions also started projects in magnetron development, leading to improvements in the split-anode device. These included Kiyoshi Morita at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Tsuneo Ito at Tokoku University. Shigeru Nakajima at Japan Radio Company (JRC) saw a commercial potential of these devices and began the further development and subsequent very profitable production of magnetrons for the medical dielectric heating (diathermy) market. The only military interest in magnetrons was shown by Yoji Ito at the Naval Technical Research Institute (NTRI). The NTRI was formed in 1922, and became fully operational in 1930. Located at Meguro, Tokyo, near the Tokyo Institute of Technology, first-rate scientists, engineers, and technicians were engaged in activities ranging from designing giant submarines to building new radio tubes. Included were all of the precursors of radar, but this did not mean that the heads of the Imperial Navy accepted these accomplishments. In 1936, Tsuneo Ito (no relationship to Yoji Ito) developed an 8-split-anode magnetron that produced about 10 W at 10 cm (3 GHz). Based on its appearance, it was named ""Tachibana"" (or Mandarin, an orange citrus fruit). Tsuneo Ito also joined the NTRI and continued his research on magnetrons in association with Yoji Ito. In 1937, they developed the technique of coupling adjacent segments (called push-pull), resulting in frequency stability, an extremely important magnetron breakthrough. By early 1939, NTRI/JRC had jointly developed a 10-cm (3-GHz), stable-frequency Mandarin-type magnetron (No. M3) that, with water cooling, could produce 500-W power. In the same time period, magnetrons were built with 10 and 12 cavities operating as low as 0.7 cm (40 GHz). The configuration of the M3 magnetron was essentially the same as that used later in the magnetron developed by Boot and Randall at Birmingham University in early 1940, including the improvement of strapped cavities. Unlike the high-power magnetron in Great Britain, however, the initial device from the NTRI generated only a few hundred watts. In general, there was no lack of scientific and engineering capabilities in Japan; their warships and aircraft clearly showed high levels of technical competency. They were ahead of Great Britain in the development of magnetrons, and their Yagi antenna was the world standard for VHF systems. It was simply that the top military leaders failed to recognize how the application of radio in detection and ranging – what was often called the Radio Range Finder (RRF) – could be of value, particularly in any defensive role; offense not defense, totally dominated their thinking. Imperial Army. In 1938, engineers from the Research Office of Nippon Electric Company (NEC) were making coverage tests on high-frequency transmitters when rapid fading of the signal was observed. This occurred whenever an aircraft passed over the line between the transmitter and receiving meter. Masatsugu Kobayashi, the Manager of NEC’s Tube Department, recognized that this was due to the beat-frequency interference of the direct signal and the Doppler-shifted signal reflected from the aircraft. Kobayashi suggested to the Army Science Research Institute that this phenomenon might be used as an aircraft warning method. Although the Army had rejected earlier proposals for using radio-detection techniques, this one had appeal because it was based on an easily understandable method and would require little developmental cost and risk to prove its military value. NEC assigned Kinji Satake of their Research Institute to develop a system called the Bi-static Doppler Interference Detector (BDID). For testing the prototype system, it was set up on an area recently occupied by Japan along the coast of China. The system operated between 4.0-7.5 MHz (75–40 m) and involved a number of widely spaced stations; this formed a radio screen that could detect the presence (but nothing more) of an aircraft at distances up to . The BDID was the Imperial Army’s first deployed radio-based detection system, placed into operation in early 1941. A similar system was developed by Satake for the Japanese homeland. Information centers received oral warnings from the operators at BDID stations, usually spaced between 65 and 240 km (40 and 150 mi). To reduce homing vulnerability – a great fear of the military – the transmitters operated with only a few watts power. Although originally intended to be temporary until better systems were available, they remained in operation throughout the war. It was not until after the start of war the Imperial Army had equipment that could be called radar. Imperial Navy. In the mid-1930s, some of the technical specialists in the Imperial Navy became interested in the possibility of using radio to detect aircraft. For consultation, they turned to Professor Yagi who, then the Director of the Radio Research Laboratory at Osaka Imperial University. Yagi suggested that this might be done by examining the Doppler frequency-shift in a reflected signal. Funding was provided to the Osaka Laboratory for experimental investigation of this technique. Kinjiro Okabe, the inventor of the split-anode magnetron and who had followed Yagi to Osaka, led the effort. Theoretical analyses indicated that the reflections would be greater if the wavelength was approximately the same as the size of aircraft structures. Thus, a VHF transmitter and receiver with Yagi antennas separated some distance were used for the experiment. In 1936, Okabe successfully detected a passing aircraft by the Doppler-interference method; this was the first recorded demonstration in Japan of aircraft detection by radio. With this success, Okabe’s research interest switched from magnetrons to VHF equipment for target detection. This, however, did not lead to any significant funding. The top levels of the Imperial Navy believed that any advantage of using radio for this purpose were greatly outweighed by enemy intercept and disclosure of the sender’s presence. Historically, warships in formation used lights and horns to avoid collision at night or when in fog. Newer techniques of VHF radio communications and direction-finding might also be used, but all of these methods were highly vulnerable to enemy interception. At the NTRI, Yoji Ito proposed that the UHF signal from a magnetron might be used to generate a very narrow beam that would have a greatly reduced chance of enemy detection.  Development of microwave system for collision avoidance started in 1939, when funding was provided by the Imperial Navy to JRC for preliminary experiments. In a cooperative effort involving Yoji Ito of the NTRI and Shigeru Nakajima of JRC, an apparatus using a 3-cm (10-GHz) magnetron with frequency modulation was designed and built. The equipment was used in an attempt to detect reflections from tall structures a few kilometers away. This experiment gave poor results, attributed to the very low power from the magnetron. The initial magnetron was replaced by one operating at 16 cm (1.9 GHz) and with considerably higher power. The results were then much better, and in October 1940, the equipment obtained clear echoes from a ship in Tokyo Bay at a distance of about . There was still no commitment by top Japanese naval officials for using this technology aboard warships. Nothing more was done at this time, but late in 1941, the system was adopted for limited use. In late 1940, Japan arranged for two technical missions to visit Germany and exchange information about their developments in military technology. Commander Yoji Ito represented the Navy’s interest in radio applications, and Lieutenant Colonel Kinji Satake did the same for the Army. During a visit of several months, they exchanged significant general information, as well as limited secret materials in some technologies, but little directly concerning radio-detection techniques. Neither side even mentioned magnetrons, but the Germans did apparently disclose their use of pulsed techniques. After receiving the reports from the technical exchange in Germany, as well as intelligence reports concerning the success of Great Britain with firing using RDF, the Naval General Staff reversed itself and tentatively accepted pulse-transmission technology. On August 2, 1941, even before Yoji Ito returned to Japan, funds were allocated for the initial development of pulse-modulated radars. Commander Chuji Hashimoto of the NTRI was responsible for initiating this activity. A prototype set operating at 4.2 m (71 MHz) and producing about 5 kW was completed on a crash basis. With the NTRI in the lead, the firm NEC and the Research Laboratory of Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) made major contributions to the effort. Kenjiro Takayanagi, Chief Engineer of NHK’s experimental television station and called “the father of Japanese television,” was especially helpful in rapidly developing the pulse-forming and timing circuits, as well as the receiver display. In early September 1941, the prototype set was first tested; it detected a single bomber at and a flight of aircraft at .  The system, Japan’s first full Radio Range Finder (RRF – radar), was designated Mark 1 Model 1. Contracts were given to three firms for serial production; NEC built the transmitters and pulse modulators, Japan Victor the receivers and associated displays, and Fuji Electrical the antennas and their servo drives. The system operated at 3.0 m (100 MHz) with a peak-power of 40 kW. Dipole arrays with matte+-type reflectors were used in separate antennas for transmitting and receiving. In November 1941, the first manufactured RRF was placed into service as a land-based early-warning system at Katsuura, Chiba, a town on the Pacific coast about from Tokyo. A large system, it weighed close to 8,700 kg (19,000 lb). The detection range was about for single aircraft and for groups. Netherlands. Early radio-based detection in the Netherlands were along two independent lines: one a microwaves system at the firm Philips and the other a VHF system at a laboratory of the Armed Forces. The Philips Company in Eindhoven, Netherlands, operated ""Natuurkundig Laboratorium"" (NatLab) for fundamental research related to its products. NatLab researcher Klass Posthumus developed a magnetron split into four elements.  In developing a communication system using this magnetron, C.H.J.A. Stall was testing the transmission by using parabolic transmitting and receiving antennas set side-by-side, both aimed at a large plate some distance away. To overcome frequency instability of the magnetron, pulse modulation was used. It was found that the plate reflected a strong signal. Recognizing the potential importance of this as a detection device, NatLab arranged a demonstration for the ""Koninklijke Marine"" (Royal Netherlands Navy). This was conducted in 1937 across the entrance to the main naval port at Marsdiep. Reflections from sea waves obscured the return from the target ship, but the Navy was sufficiently impressed to initiate sponsorship of the research. In 1939, an improved set was demonstrated at Wijk aan Zee, detecting a vessel at a distance of . A prototype system was built by Philips, and plans were started by the firm Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek (a Philips subsidiary) for building a chain of warning stations to protect the primary ports. Some field testing of the prototype was conducted, but the project was discontinued when Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10, 1940. Within the NatLab, however, the work was continued in great secrecy until 1942. During the early 1930s, there were widespread rumours of a “death ray” being developed. The Dutch Parliament set up a Committee for the Applications of Physics in Weaponry under G.J. Elias to examine this potential, but the Committee quickly discounted death rays. The Committee did, however, establish the ""Laboratorium voor Fysieke Ontwikkeling"" (LFO, Laboratory for Physical Development), dedicated to supporting the Netherlands Armed Forces. Operating in great secrecy, the LFO opened a facility called the ""Meetgebouw"" (Measurements Building) located on the Plain of Waalsdorp. In 1934, J.L.W.C. von Weiler joined the LFO and, with S.G. Gratama, began research on a 1.25-m (240-MHz) communication system to be used in artillery spotting. In 1937, while tests were being conducted on this system, a passing flock of birds disturbed the signal. Realizing that this might be a potential method for detecting aircraft, the Minister of War ordered continuation of the experiments. Weiler and Gratama set about developing a system for directing searchlights and aiming anti-aircraft guns. The experimental “electrical listening device” operated at 70 cm (430 MHz) and used pulsed transmission at an RPF of 10 kHz. A transmit-receive blocking circuit was developed to allow a common antenna. The received signal was displayed on a CR tube with a circular time base. This set was demonstrated to the Army in April 1938 and detected an aircraft at a range of . The set was rejected, however, because it could not withstand the harsh environment of Army combat conditions. The Navy was more receptive. Funding was provided for final development, and Max Staal was added to the team. To maintain secrecy, they divided the development into parts. The transmitter was built at the Delft Technical College and the receiver at the University of Leiden. Ten sets would be assembled under the personal supervision of J.J.A. Schagen van Leeuwen, head of the firm Hazemeijer Fabriek van Signaalapparaten. The prototype had a peak-power of 1 kW, and used a pulse length of 2 to 3 μs with a 10- to 20 kHz PRF. The receiver was a super-heterodyne type using Acorn tubes and a 6 MHz IF stage. The antenna consisted of 4 rows of 16 half-wave dipoles backed by a 3- by 3-meter mesh screen. The operator used a bicycle-type drive to rotate the antenna, and the elevation could be changed using a hand crank. Several sets were completed, and one was put into operation on the Malievelt in The Hague just before the Netherlands fell to Germany in May 1940. The set worked well, spotting enemy aircraft during the first days of fighting. To prevent capture, operating units and plans for the system were destroyed. Von Weiler and Max Staal fled to England aboard one of the last ships able to leave, carrying two disassembled sets with them. Later, Gratama and van Leeuwen also escaped to England. France. In 1927, French physicists Camille Gutton and Emile Pierret experimented with magnetrons and other devices generating wavelengths going down to 16 cm. Camille's son, Henri Gutton, was with the ""Compagnie Générale de Télégraphie Sans Fil"" (CSF) where he and Robert Warneck improved his father's magnetrons. Emile Girardeau, the head of the CSF, recalled in testimony that they were at the time intending to build radio-detection systems """"conceived according to the principles stated by Tesla"". In 1934, following systematic studies on the magnetron, the research branch of the CSF, headed by Maurice Ponte, submitted a patent application for a device designed to detect obstacles using continuous radiation of ultra-short wavelengths produced by a magnetron. These were still CW systems and depended on Doppler interference for detection. However, as most modern radars, antennas were collocated. The device was measuring distance and azimuth but not directly as in the later ""radar"" on a screen (1939). Still, this was the first patent of an operational radio-detection apparatus using centimetric wavelengths. The system was tested in late 1934 aboard the cargo ship ""Oregon"", with two transmitters working at 80 cm and 16 cm wavelengths. Coastlines and boats were detected from a range of 10-12 nautical miles. The shortest wavelength was chosen for the final design, which equipped the liner ""SS Normandie"" as early as mid-1935 for operational use. In late 1937, Maurice Elie at SFR developed a means of pulse-modulating transmitter tubes. This led to a new 16-cm system with a peak power near 500 W and a pulse width of 6 μs. French and U.S. patents were filed in December 1939. The system was planned to be sea-tested aboard the ""Normandie"", but this was cancelled at the outbreak of war. At the same time, Pierre David at the ""Laboratoire National de Radioélectricité"" (National Laboratory of Radioelectricity, LNR) experimented with reflected radio signals at about a meter wavelength. Starting in 1931, he observed that aircraft caused interference to the signals. The LNR then initiated research on a detection technique called ""barrage électromagnétique"" (electromagnetic curtain). While this could indicate the general location of penetration, precise determination of direction and speed was not possible. In 1936, the ""Défense Aérienne du Territoire"" (Defence of Air Territory), ran tests on David’s electromagnetic curtain. In the tests, the system detected most of the entering aircraft, but too many were missed. As the war grew closer, the need for an aircraft detection was critical. David realized the advantages of a pulsed system, and in October 1938 he designed a 50 MHz, pulse-modulated system with a peak-pulse power of 12 kW. This was built by the firm SADIR. France declared war on Germany on September 1, 1939, and there was a great need for an early-warning detection system. The SADIR system was taken to near Toulon, and detected and measured the range of invading aircraft as far as . The SFR pulsed system was set up near Paris where it detected aircraft at ranges up to . However the German advance was overwhelming and emergency measures had to be taken; it was too late for France to develop radars alone and it was decided that her breakthroughs would be shared with her allies. In mid-1940, Maurice Ponte, from the laboratories of CSF in Paris, presented a cavity magnetron designed by Henri Gutton at SFR (see above) to the GEC laboratories at Wembley, Great Britain. This magnetron was designed for pulsed operation at a wavelength of 16 cm. Unlike other magnetron designs to that day, such as the Boots and Randall magnetron (see British contributions above), this tube used an oxide-coated cathode with a peak power output of 1 kW, demonstrating that oxide cathodes were the solution for producing high-power pulses at short wavelengths, a problem which had eluded British and American researchers for years. The significance this event was underlined by Eric Megaw, in a 1946 review of early radar developments: ""This was the starting point of the use of the oxide cathode in practically all our subsequent pulsed transmitting waves and as such was a significant contribution to British radar. The date was the 8th May, 1940"". A tweaked version of this magnetron reached a peak output of 10 kW by August 1940. It was that model which, in turn, was handed to the Americans as a token of good faith during the negotiations made by the Tizard delegation in 1940 to obtain from the U.S. the resources necessary for Great Britain to exploit the full military potential of her research and development work. Italy. Guglielmo Marconi initiated the research in Italy on radio-based detection technology. In 1933, while participating with his Italian firm in experiments with a 600 MHz communications link across Rome, he noted transmission disturbances caused by moving objects adjacent to its path. This led to the development at his laboratory at Cornegliano of a 330-MHz (0.91-m) CW Doppler detection system that he called ""radioecometro"". Barkhausen-Kurz tubes were used in both the transmitter and receiver. In May 1935, Marconi demonstrated his system to the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and members of the military General Staff; however the output power was insufficient for military use. While Marconi’s demonstration raised considerable interest, little more was done with his apparatus. Mussolini directed that radio-based detection technology be further developed, and it was assigned to the ""Regio Instituto Electrotecnico e delle Comunicazioni"" (RIEC, Royal Institute for Electro-technics and Communications). The RIEC had been established in 1916 on the campus of the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno. Lieutenant Ugo Tiberio, a physics and radio-technology instructor at the Academy, was assigned to head the project on a part-time basis. Tiberio prepared a report on developing an experimental apparatus that he called ""telemetro radiofonico del rivelatore"" (RDT, Radio-Detector Telemetry). The report, submitted in mid-1936, included what was later known as the radar range equation. When the work got underway, Nello Carrara, a civilian physics instructor who had been doing research at the RIEC in microwaves, was added to be responsible for developing the RDT transmitter. Before the end of 1936, Tiberio and Carrara had demonstrated the EC-1, the first Italian RDT system. This had an FM transmitter operating at 200 MHz (1.5 m) with a single parabolic cylinder antenna. It detected by mixing the transmitted and the Doppler-shifted reflected signals, resulting in an audible tone. The EC-1 did not provide a range measurement; to add this capability, development of a pulsed system was initiated in 1937. Captain Alfeo Brandimarte joined the group and primarily designed the first pulsed system, the EC-2. This operated at 175 MHz (1.7 m) and used a single antenna made with a number of equi-phased dipoles. The detected signal was intended to be displayed on an oscilloscope. There were many problems, and the system never reached the testing stage. Work then turned to developing higher power and operating frequencies. Carrara, in cooperation with the firm FIVRE, developed a magnetron-like device. This was composed of a pair of triodes connected to a resonate cavity and produced 10 kW at 425 MHz (70 cm). It was used in designing two versions of the EC-3, one for shipboard and the other for coastal defense. Italy, joining Germany, entered WWII in June 1940 without an operational RDT. A breadboard of the EC-3 was built and tested from atop a building at the Academy, but most RDT work was stopped as direct support of the war took priority. Others. In early 1939, the British Government invited representatives from the most technically advanced Commonwealth Nations to visit England for briefings and demonstrations on the highly secret RDF (radar) technology. Based on this, RDF developments were started in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa by September 1939. In addition, this technology was independently developed in Hungary early in the war period. In Australia, the Radiophysics Laboratory was established at Sydney University under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; John H. Piddington was responsible for RDF development. The first project was a 200-MHz (1.5-m) shore-defense system for the Australian Army. Designated ShD, this was first tested in September 1941, and eventually installed at 17 ports. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Royal Australian Air Force urgently needed an air-warning system, and Piddington’s team, using the ShD as a basis, put the AW Mark I together in five days. It was being installed in Darwin, Northern Territory, when Australia received the first Japanese attack on February 19, 1942. A short time later, it was converted to a light-weight transportable version, the LW-AW Mark II; this was used by the Australian forces, as well as the U.S. Army, in early island landings in the South Pacific. The early RDF developments in Canada were at the Radio Section of the National Research Council of Canada. Using commercial components and with essentially no further assistance from Great Britain, John Tasker Henderson led a team in developing the Night Watchman, a surface-warning system for the Royal Canadian Navy to protect the entrance to the Halifax Harbour. Successfully tested in July 1940, this set operated at 200 MHz (1.5 m), had a 1 kW output with a pulse length of 0.5 μs, and used a relatively small, fixed antenna. This was followed by a ship-borne set designated Surface Warning 1st Canadian (SW1C) with the antenna hand-rotated; this was first tested at sea in mid-May 1941, For coastal defense by the Canadian Army, a 200 MHz set with a transmitter similar to the Night Watchman was developed. Designated CD, it used a large, rotating antenna atop a wooden tower. The CD was put into operation in January 1942. Ernest Marsden represented New Zealand at the briefings in England, and then established two facilities for RDF development – one in Wellington at the Radio Section of the Central NZ Post Office, and another at Canterbury University College in Christchurch. Charles N. Watson-Munro led the development of land-based and airborne sets at Wellington, while Frederick W. G. White led the development of shipboard sets at Christchurch. Before the end of 1939, the Wellington group had converted an existing 180-MHz (1.6-m), 1 kW transmitter to produce 2-μs pulses and tested it to detect large vessels at up to 30 km; this was designated CW (Coastal Watching). A similar set, designated CD (Coast Defense) used a CRT for display and had lobe-switching on the receiving antenna; this was deployed in Wellington in late 1940. A partially completed ASV 200 MHz set was brought from Great Britain by Marsden, and another group at Wellington built this into an aircraft set for the Royal New Zealand Air Force; this was first flown in early 1940. At Christchurch, there was a smaller staff and work went slower, but by July 1940, a 430-MHz (70-cm), 5 kW set was tested. Two types, designated SW (Ship Warning) and SWG (Ship Warning, Gunnery), were placed into service by the Royal New Zealand Navy starting in August 1941. In all some 44 types were developed in New Zealand during WW1. South Africa did not have a representative at the 1939 meetings in England, but in mid-September, as Ernest Marsden was returning by ship to New Zealand, Basil F. J. Schonland came aboard and received three days of briefings. Schonland, a world authority on lightning and Director of the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics at Witwatersrand University, immediately started an RDF development using amateur radio components and Institute’s lightning-monitoring equipment. Designated JB (for Johannesburg), the 90-MHz (3.3-m), 500-W mobile system was tested in November 1939, just two months after its start. The prototype was operated in Durban before the end of 1939, detecting ships and aircraft at distances up to 80 km, and by the next March a system was fielded by anti-aircraft brigades of the South African Defence Force. In Hungary, Zoltán Lajos Bay was a Professor of Physics at the Technical University of Budapest as well as the Research Director of Egyesült Izzolampa (IZZO), a radio and electrical manufacturing firm. In late 1942, IZZO was directed by the Minister of Defense to develop a radio-location (""rádiólokáció"", radar) system. Using journal papers on ionospheric measurements for information on pulsed transmission, Bay developed a system called ""Sas"" (Eagle) around existing communications hardware. The ""Sas"" operated at 120 MHz (2.5 m) and was in a cabin with separate transmitting and receiving dipole arrays attached; the assembly was all on a rotatable platform. According to published records, the system was tested in 1944 atop Mount János and had a range of “better than 500 km.” A second ""Sas"" was installed at another location. There is no indication that either ""Sas"" installation was ever in regular service. After the war, Bay used a modified ""Sas"" to successfully bounce a signal off the moon. World War II radar. At the start of World War II in September 1939, both the United Kingdom and Germany knew of each other's ongoing efforts in radio navigation and its countermeasures – the ""Battle of the beams"". Also, both nations were generally aware of, and intensely interested in, the other's developments in radio-based detection and tracking, and engaged in an active campaign of espionage and false leaks about their respective equipment. By the time of the Battle of Britain, both sides were deploying range and direction-finding units (radars) and control stations as part of integrated air defense capability. However, the German ""Funkmessgerät"" (radio measuring device) systems could not assist in an offensive role and was thus not supported by Adolf Hitler. Also, the ""Luftwaffe"" did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of British Range and Direction Finding (RDF) stations as part of RAF's air defense capability, contributing to their failure. While the United Kingdom and Germany led in pre-war advances in the use of radio for detection and tracking of aircraft, there were also developments in the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. Wartime systems in all of these nations will be summarized. The acronym RADAR (for RAdio Detection And Ranging) was coined by the U.S. Navy in 1940, and the subsequent name ""radar"" was soon widely used. Post-war radar. World War II, which gave impetus to the great surge in radar development, ended between the Allies and Germany in May 1945, followed by Japan in August. With this, radar activities in Germany and Japan ceased for a number of years. In other countries, particularly the United States, Great Britain, and the USSR, the politically unstable post-war years saw continued radar improvements for military applications. In fact, these three nations all made significant efforts in bringing scientists and engineers from Germany to work in their weapon programs; in the U.S., this was under Operation Paperclip. Even before the end of the war, various project directed toward non-military applications of radar and closely related technologies were initiated. The US Army Air Forces and the British RAF had made wartime advances in using radar for handling aircraft landing, and this was rapidly expanded into the civil sector. The field of radio astronomy was one of the related technologies; although discovered before the war, it immediately flourished in the late 1940s with many scientists around the world establishing new careers based on their radar experience. Four techniques, highly important in post-war radars, were matured in the late 1940s-early 1950s: pulse Doppler, monopulse, phased array, and synthetic aperture; the first three were known and even used during wartime developments, but were matured later. One of the early applications of digital computers was in switching the signal phase in elements of large phased-array antennas. As smaller computers came into being, these were quickly applied to digital signal processing using algorithms for improving radar performance. Other advances in radar systems and applications in the decades following WWII are far too many to be included herein. The following sections are intended to provide representative samples. Military radars. In the United States, the Rad Lab at MIT officially closed at the end of 1945. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Army’s Evans Signal Laboratory continued with new activities in centimeter radar development. The United States Air Force (USAF) – separated from the Army in 1946 – concentrated radar research at their Cambridge Research Center (CRC) at Hanscom Field, Massachusetts. In 1951, MIT opened the Lincoln Laboratory for joint developments with the CRC. While the Bell Telephone Laboratories embarked on major communications upgrades, they continued with the Army in radar for their ongoing Nike air-defense program In Great Britain, the RAF’s Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and the Army’s Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) both continued at reduced levels at Malvern, Worcestershire, then in 1953 were combined to form the Radar Research Establishment. In 1948, all of the Royal Navy’s radio and radar R&D activities were combined to form the Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment, located near Portsmouth, Hampshire. The USSR, although devastated by the war, immediately embarked on the development of new weapons, including radars. During the Cold War period following WWII, the primary ""axis"" of combat shifted to lie between the United States and the Soviet Union. By 1949, both sides had nuclear weapons carried by bombers. To provide early warning of an attack, both deployed huge radar networks of increasing sophistication at ever-more remote locations. In the West, the first such system was the Pinetree Line, deployed across Canada in the early 1950s, backed up with radar pickets on ships and oil platforms off the east and west coasts. The Pinetree Line initially used vintage pulsed radars and was soon supplemented with the Mid-Canada Line (MCL). Soviet technology improvements made these Lines inadequate and, in a construction project involving 25,000 persons, the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) was completed in 1957. Stretching from Alaska to Baffin Island and covering over , the DEW Line consisted of 63 stations with AN/FPS-19 high-power, pulsed, L-Band radars, most augmented by AN/FPS-23 pulse-Doppler systems. The Soviet Unit tested its first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in August 1957, and in a few years the early-warning role was passed almost entirely to the more capable DEW Line. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union then had ICBMs with nuclear warheads, and each began the development of a major anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system. In the USSR, this was the Fakel V-1000, and for this they developed powerful radar systems. This was eventually deployed around Moscow as the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, supported by radars designated by NATO as the Cat House, Dog House, and Hen House. In 1957, the U.S. Army initiated an ABM system first called Nike-X; this passed through several names, eventually becoming the Safeguard Program. For this, there was a long-range Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) and a shorter-range, more precise Missile Site Radar (MSR). The PAR was housed in a -high nuclear-hardened building with one face sloping 25 degrees facing north. This contained 6,888 antenna elements separated in transmitting and receiving phased arrays. The L-Band transmitter used 128 long-life traveling-wave tubes (TWTs), having a combined power in the megawatt range The PAR could detect incoming missiles outside the atmosphere at distances up to . The MSR had an , truncated pyramid structure, with each face holding a phased-array antenna in diameter and containing 5,001 array elements used for both transmitting and receiving. Operating in the S-Band, the transmitter used two klystrons functioning in parallel, each with megawatt-level power. The MSR could search for targets from all directions, acquiring them at up to range. One Safeguard site, intended to defend Minuteman ICBM missile silos near the Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, was finally completed in October 1975, but the U.S. Congress withdrew all funding after it was operational but a single day. During the following decades, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force developed a variety of large radar systems, but the long-serving BTL gave up military development work in the 1970s. A modern radar developed by of the U.S. Navy that should be noted is the AN/SPY-1. First fielded in 1973, this S-Band, 6 MW system has gone through a number of variants and is a major component of the Aegis Combat System. An automatic detect-and-track system, it is computer controlled using four complementary three-dimensional passive electronically scanned array antennas to provide hemispherical coverage. Radar signals, traveling with line-of-sight propagation, normally have a range to ground targets limited by the visible horizon, or less than about . Airborne targets can be detected by ground-level radars at greater ranges, but, at best, several hundred miles. Since the beginning of radio, it had been known that signals of appropriate frequencies (3 to 30 MHz) could be “bounced” from the ionosphere and received at considerable distances. As long-range bombers and missiles came into being, there was a need to have radars give early warnings at great ranges. In the early 1950s, a team at the Naval Research Laboratory came up with the Over-the-Horizon (OTH) radar for this purpose. To distinguish targets from other reflections, it was necessary to use a phase-Doppler system. Very sensitive receivers with low-noise amplifiers had to be developed. Since the signal going to the target and returning had a propagation loss proportional to the range raised to the fourth power, a powerful transmitter and large antennas were required. A digital computer with considerable capability (new at that time) was necessary for analyzing the data. In 1950, their first experimental system was able to detect rocket launches away at Cape Canaveral, and the cloud from a nuclear explosion in Nevada distant. In the early 1970s, a joint American-British project, code named Cobra Mist, used a 10-MW OTH radar at Orfordness (the birthplace of British radar), England, in an attempt to detect aircraft and missile launchings over the Western USSR. Because of US-USSR ABM agreements, this was abandoned within two years. In the same time period, the Soviets were developing a similar system; this successfully detected a missile launch at . By 1976, this had matured into an operational system named ""Duga"" (“Arc” in English), but known to western intelligence as Steel Yard and called Woodpecker by radio amateurs and others who suffered from its interference – the transmitter was estimated to have a power of 10 MW. Australia, Canada, and France also developed OTH radar systems. With the advent of satellites with early-warning capabilities, the military lost most of its interest in OTH radars. However, in recent years, this technology has been reactivated for detecting and tracking ocean shipping in applications such as maritime reconnaissance and drug enforcement. Systems using an alternate technology have also been developed for over-the-horizon detection. Due to diffraction, electromagnetic surface waves are scattered to the rear of objects, and these signals can be detected in a direction opposite from high-powered transmissions. Called OTH-SW (SW for Surface Wave), Russia is using such a system to monitor the Sea of Japan, and Canada has a system for coastal surveillance. Civil Aviation Radars. The post-war years saw the beginning of a revolutionary development in Air Traffic Control (ATC) – the introduction of radar. In 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) unveiled an experimental radar-equipped tower for control of civil flights. By 1952, the CAA had begun its first routine use of radar for approach and departure control. Four years later, it placed a large order for long-range radars for use in ""en route"" ATC; these had the capability, at higher altitudes, to see aircraft within 200 nautical miles (370 km). In 1960, it became required for aircraft flying in certain areas to carry a radar transponder that identified the aircraft and helped improve radar performance. Since 1966, the responsible agency has been called the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) is an ATC facility usually located within the vicinity of a large airport. In the US Air Force it is known as RAPCON (Radar Approach Control), and in the US Navy as a RATCF (Radar Air Traffic Control Facility). Typically, the TRACON controls aircraft within a 30 to 50 nautical mile (56 to 93 km) radius of the airport at an altitude between 10,000 to 15,000 feet (3,000 to 4,600 m). This uses one or more Airport Surveillance Radars (ASR-7, 8, & 9), sweeping the sky once every few seconds. The Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) is a newer TRACOM radar system, replacing the old analog systems with digital technology. The civilian nomenclature for this radar is the ASR-11, and AN/GPN-30 is used by the military. Two radar systems are included. The primary is an X-Band (~2.8 GHz) system with 25 kW pulse power. It provides 3-D tracking of target aircraft and also measures rainfall intensity. The secondary is a P-Band (~1.05 GHz) system with a peak-power of about 25 kW. It uses a transponder set to interrogate aircraft and receive operational data. The antennas for both systems rotate atop a tall tower. Weather radar. During World War II, military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to weather elements like rain, snow, and sleet. Just after the war, military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the Armed Forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes. In the United States, David Atlas, for the Air Force group at first, and later for MIT, developed the first operational weather radars. In Canada, J.S. Marshall and R.H. Douglas formed the ""Stormy Weather Group "" in Montreal. Marshall and his doctoral student Walter Palmer are well known for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to understanding of the Z-R relation, which correlates a given radar reflectivity with the rate at which water is falling on the ground. In the United Kingdom, research continued to study the radar echo patterns and weather elements such as stratiform rain and convective clouds, and experiments were done to evaluate the potential of different wavelengths from 1 to 10 centimetres. Between 1950 and 1980, reflectivity radars, which measure position and intensity of precipitation, were built by weather services around the world. In United States, the U.S. Weather Bureau, established in 1870 with the specific mission of to provide meteorological observations and giving notice of approaching storms, developed the WSR-1 (Weather Surveillance Radar-1), one of the first weather radars. This was a modified version of the AN/APS-2F radar, which the Weather Bureau acquired from the Navy. The WSR-1A, WSR-3, and WSR-4 were also variants of this radar. This was followed by the WSR-57 (Weather Surveillance Radar – 1957) was the first weather radar designed specifically for a national warning network. Using WWII technology based on vacuum tubes, it gave only coarse reflectivity data and no velocity information. Operating at 2.89 GHz (S-Band), it had a peak-power of 410 kW and a maximum range of about . AN/FPS-41 was the military designation for the WSR-57. The early meteorologists had to watch a cathode ray tube. During the 1970s, radars began to be standardized and organized into larger networks. The next significant change in the United States was the WSR-74 series, beginning operations in 1974. There were two types: the WSR-74S, for replacements and filling gaps in the WSR-57 national network, and the WSR-74C, primarily for local use. Both were transistor-based, and their primary technical difference was indicated by the letter, S band (better suited for long range) and C band, respectively. Until the 1990s, there were 128 of the WSR-57 and WSR-74 model radars were spread across that country. The first devices to capture radar images were developed during the same period. The number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation, so that horizontal cross-sections (CAPPI) and vertical ones could be performed. Studies of the organization of thunderstorms were then possible for the Alberta Hail Project in Canada and National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in the US in particular. The NSSL, created in 1964, began experimentation on dual polarization signals and on Doppler effect uses. In May 1973, a tornado devastated Union City, Oklahoma, just west of Oklahoma City. For the first time, a Dopplerized 10-cm wavelength radar from NSSL documented the entire life cycle of the tornado. The researchers discovered a mesoscale rotation in the cloud aloft before the tornado touched the ground : the tornadic vortex signature. NSSL's research helped convince the National Weather Service that Doppler radar was a crucial forecasting tool. Between 1980 and 2000, weather radar networks became the norm in North America, Europe, Japan and other developed countries. Conventional radars were replaced by Doppler radars, which in addition to position and intensity of could track the relative velocity of the particles in the air. In the United States, the construction of a network consisting of wavelength radars, called NEXRAD or WSR-88D (Weather Service Radar 1988 Doppler), was started in 1988 following NSSL's research. In Canada, Environment Canada constructed the King City station, with a five centimeter research Doppler radar, by 1985;McGill University dopplerized its radar (J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory) in 1993. This led to a complete Canadian Doppler network between 1998 and 2004. France and other European countries switched to Doppler network by the end of the 1990s to early 2000s. Meanwhile, rapid advances in computer technology led to algorithms to detect signs of severe weather and a plethora of ""products"" for media outlets and researchers. After 2000, research on dual polarization technology has moved into operational use, increasing the amount of information available on precipitation type (e.g. rain vs. snow). ""Dual polarization"" means that microwave radiation which is polarized both horizontally and vertically (with respect to the ground) is emitted. Wide-scale deployment is expected by the end of the decade in some countries such as the United States, France, and Canada. Since 2003, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been experimenting with phased-array radar as a replacement for conventional parabolic antenna to provide more time resolution in atmospheric sounding. This would be very important in severe thunderstorms as their evolution can be better evaluated with more timely data. Also in 2003, the National Science Foundation established the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere, ""CASA"", a multidisciplinary, multi-university collaboration of engineers, computer scientists, meteorologists, and sociologists to conduct fundamental research, develop enabling technology, and deploy prototype engineering systems designed to augment existing radar systems by sampling the generally undersampled lower troposphere with inexpensive, fast scanning, dual polarization, mechanically scanned and phased array radars. Mapping Radar. The plan position indicator, dating from the early days of radar and still the most common type of display, provides a map of the targets surrounding the radar location. If the radar antenna on an aircraft is aimed downward, a map of the terrain is generated, and the larger the antenna, the greater the image resolution. After centimeter radar came into being, downward-looking radars – the H2S ( L-Band) and H2X (C-Band) – provided real-time maps used by the U.S. and Great Britain in bombing runs over Europe at night and through dense clouds. In 1951, Carl Wiley led a team at Goodyear Aircraft Corporation (later Goodyear Aerospace) in developing a technique for greatly expanding and improving the resolution of radar-generated images. Called synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an ordinary-sized antenna fixed to the side of an aircraft is used with highly complex signal processing to give an image that would otherwise require a much larger, scanning antenna; thus, the name synthetic aperture. As each pulse is emitted, it is radiated over a lateral band onto the terrain. The return is spread in time, due to reflections from features at different distances. Motion of the vehicle along the flight path gives the horizontal increments. The amplitude and phase of returns are combined by the signal processor using Fourier transform techniques in forming the image. The overall technique is closely akin to optical holography. Through the years, many variations of the SAR have been made with diversified applications resulting. In initial systems, the signal processing was too complex for on-board operation; the signals were recorded and processed later. Processors using optical techniques were then tried for generating real-time images, but advances in high-speed electronics now allow on-board processes for most applications. Early systems gave a resolution in tens of meters, but more recent airborne systems provide resolutions to about 10 cm. Current ultra-wideband systems have resolutions of a few millimeters. Other radars and applications. There are many other post-war radar systems and applications. Only a few will be noted. Radar gun. The most widespread radar device today is undoubtedly the radar gun. This is a small, usually hand-held, Doppler radar that is used to detect the speed of objects, especially trucks and automobiles in regulating traffic, as well as pitched baseballs, runners, or other moving objects in sports. This device can also be used to measure the surface speed of water and continuously manufactured materials. A radar gun does not return information regarding the object's position; it uses the Doppler effect to measure the speed of a target. First developed in 1954, most radar guns operate with very low power in the X or Ku Bands. Some use infrared radiation or laser light; these are usually called LIDAR. A related technology for velocity measurements in flowing liquids or gasses is called laser Doppler velocimetry; this technology dates from the mid-1960s. Impulse Radar. As pulsed radars were initially being developed, the use of very narrow pulses was examined. The pulse length governs the accuracy of distance measurement by radar – the shorter the pulse, the greater the precision. Also, for a given pulse repetition frequency (PRF), a shorter pulse results in a higher peak power. Harmonic analysis shows that the narrower the pulse, the wider the band of frequencies that contain the energy, leading to such systems also being called wide-band radars. In the early days, the electronics for generating and receiving these pulses was not available; thus, essentially no applications of this were initially made. By the 1970s, advances in electronics led to renewed interest in what was often called short-pulse radar. With further advances, it became practical to generate pulses having a width on the same order as the period of the RF carrier (T = 1/f). This is now generally called impulse radar. The first significant application of this technology was in ground-penetrating radar (GPR). Developed in the 1970s, GPR is now used for structural foundation analysis, archeological mapping, treasure hunting, unexploded ordnance identification, and other shallow investigations. This is possible because impulse radar can concisely locate the boundaries between the general media (the soil) and the desired target. The results, however, are non-unique and are highly dependant upon the skill of the operator and the subsequent interpretation of the data. In dry or otherwise favorable soil and rock, penetration up to is often possible. For distance measurements at these short ranges, the transmitted pulse is usually only one radio-frequency cycle in duration; With a 100 MHz carrier and a PRF of 10 kHz (typical parameters), the pulse duration is only 10 ns (nanosecond). leading to the ""impulse"" designation. A variety of GPR systems are commercially available in back-pack and wheeled-cart versions with pulse-power up to a kilowatt. With continued development of electronics, systems with pulse durations measured in picoseconds became possible. Applications are as varied as security and motion sensors, building stud-finders, collision-warning devices, and cardiac-dynamics monitors. Some of these devices are match-box sized, including a long-life power source. Radar astronomy. As radar was being developed, astronomers considered its application in making observations of the Moon and other near-by extraterrestrial objects. In 1944, Zoltán Lajos Bay had this as a major objective as he developed a radar in Hungary. Sadly, his radar telescope was taken away by the conquering Soviet army and had to be rebuilt, thus delaying the experiment. Under Project Diana conducted by the Army’s Evans Signal Laboratory in New Jersey, a modified SCR-271 radar (the fixed-position version of the SCR-270) operating at 110 MHz with 3 kW peak-power, was used in receiving echoes from the Moon on January 10, 1946. Zoltán Bay accomplished this on the following February 6. Radio astronomy also had its start following WWII, and many scientists involved in radar development then entered this field. A number of radio observatories were constructed during the following years; however, because of the additional cost and complexity of involving transmitters and associated receiving equipment, very few were dedicated to radar astronomy. In fact, essentially all major radar astronomy activities have been conducted as adjuncts to radio astronomy observatories. The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory, opened in 1963, is the largest in the world. Owned by the U.S. National Science Foundation and contractor operated, it is used primarily for radio astronomy, but equipment is available for radar astronomy. This includes transmitters operating at 47 MHz, 439 MHz, and 2.38 GHz, all with very-high pulse power. It has a 305-m (1,000-ft) primary reflector fixed in position; the secondary reflector is on tracks to allow precise pointing to different parts of the sky. Many significant scientific discoveries have been made using the Arecibo radar telescope, including mapping of surface roughness of Mars and observations of Saturns and its largest moon, Titan. In 1989, the observatory radar-imaged an asteroid for the first time in history. Several spacecraft orbiting the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Saturn have carried radars for surface mapping; a ground-penetration radar was carried on the Mars Express mission. Radar systems on a number of aircraft and orbiting spacecraft have mapped the entire Earth for various purposes; on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the entire planet was mapped at a 30-m resolution. The Jodrell Bank Observatory, an operation of the University of Manchester in Great Britain, was originally started by Bernard Lovell to be a radar astronomy facility. It initially used a war-surplus GL-II radar system operating at 71 MHz (4.2 m). The first observations were of ionized trails in the Geminids meteor shower during December 1945. While the facility soon evolved to become the third largest radio observatory in the world, some radar astronomy continued. The largest (250-ft or 76-m in diameter) of their three fully steerable radio telescopes became operational just in time to radar track ""Sputnik 1"", the first artificial satellite, in October 1957.

wikipedia-1280068," Greeking  Greeking is a style of displaying or rendering text or symbols, not always from the Greek alphabet. Greeking obscures portions of a work for the purpose of either emphasizing form over details or displaying placeholders for unavailable content. The name is a reference to the phrase ""Greek to me"", meaning something that one cannot understand, so that it might as well be in a foreign language. In typography. Greeked text is used in typography to evaluate a certain typeface's appropriateness, overall style or type color. Because a viewer can be distracted by meaningful content, greeking unimportant text forces the viewer to focus on layout and design. Greeking is also used when a design is being developed but the content is unfinished. One example might be the layout of a magazine article which has photographs but no text; initially, a lorem ipsum text is used, and then the nonsense text is replaced with draft versions as they become available. This allows design and layout to be carried out in parallel with content revisions. In WYSIWYG software. The term ""greeking"" was applied by various WYSIWYG editors of the 1980s, of the type exemplified by ApplixWare and Island Graphics. Greeking referred to the literal replacement of a poorly imaged sequence of text with a literal gray bar upon moving out of focus. A busy page seen as a whole might reveal extremely a small run of ultra-fine text as greeked. In visual media. As in typography, greeking involves inserting nonsense text or, commonly, Greek or Latin text in prototypes of visual media projects (such as in graphic and web design) to check the layout of the final version before the actual text is available, or to enhance layout assessment by eliminating the distraction of readable text. Text of this sort is known as ""greeked text"", ""dummy text"", or ""jabberwocky text"". ""Lorem ipsum"" is a commonly used example, though this is derived from Latin, not Greek. In computing. Greeking can refer to the automatic rendering of text characters as unreadable symbols or lines in the layout preview function of word processing documents, either to speed up screen display or because the graphics display capabilities of the monitor are insufficient for rendering extremely small texts. In the arts. Greeking in theatre, television, and film production art-department work refers to the process of changing or hiding corporate trademarks that have not been ""cleared"" legally for use in the production. Anime and manga series show prolific examples of trademark greeking, creating altered versions of trademarked terms like Hescafé, WcDonald's, and AVIO. "
wikipedia-1280085," Cinder  A cinder is a pyroclastic material. Cinders are extrusive igneous rocks. Cinders are similar to pumice, which has so many cavities and is such low-density that it can float on water. Cinder is typically brown, black, or red depending on its chemical content. A more modern name for cinder is Scoria. Characteristics. The following geologic characteristics define a cinder: Uses. Cinders have been used on track surfaces and roads to provide additional traction in winter conditions. Cinders are also employed as inorganic mulch in xeriscaping, because of excellent drainage properties and erosion resistance. In this context, they are referred to frequently with the name ""lava rock"". This is why cinder is used in roads. "
wikipedia-1280086," Ionocraft  An ionocraft or ion-propelled aircraft, commonly known as a lifter or hexalifter, is an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) device that uses an electrical phenomenon known as the Biefeld–Brown effect to produce thrust in the air, without requiring any combustion or moving parts. The term ""Ionocraft"" dates back to the 1960s, an era in which EHD experiments were at their peak. In its basic form, it simply consists of two parallel conductive electrodes, one in the form of a fine wire and another which may be formed of either a wire grid, tubes or foil skirts with a smooth round surface. When such an arrangement is powered up by high voltage in the range of a few kilovolts, it produces thrust. The ionocraft forms part of the EHD thruster family, but is a special case in which the ionisation and accelerating stages are combined into a single stage. The device is a popular science fair project for students. It is also popular among anti-gravity or so-called ""electrogravitics"" proponents, especially on the Internet. The term ""lifter"" is an accurate description because it is not an anti-gravity device, but produces lift in the same sense as a rocket from the reaction force from driving the ionized air downward. Much like a rocket or a jet engine (it can actually be much more thrust efficient than a jet engine), the force that an ionocraft generates is oriented consistently along its own axis, regardless of the surrounding gravitational field. Claims of the device working in a vacuum also have been disproved. Ionocraft require many safety precautions due to the high voltage required for their operation, and also the risk of premature death from heart or lung disease due to the inhalation of their ionised air product, ozone. A large subculture has grown up around this simple EHD thrusting device and its physics are now known to a much better extent. Description. The ionocraft is a propulsion device based on ionic air propulsion that works without moving parts, flies silently, uses only electrical energy and is able to lift its own weight plus additional payload, with the future prospect of its power supply. The principle of ionic wind propulsion with corona-generated charged particles has been known from the earliest days of the discovery of electricity, with references dating back to 1709 in a book titled ""Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects"" by Francis Hauksbee. However, its use for propulsion was first given serious thought by Thomas Townsend Brown in 1928 and later on by Major Alexander Prokofieff de Seversky, who contributed much to its basic physics and construction variations in 1960. In fact, it was Major de Seversky himself who in 1964 coined the term Ionocraft in his (). The basic external design of these devices can be found in older patents, dating back to 1960 filed by Thomas Townsend Brown, titled ""Elektrokinetic Apparatus"". More recent research has cleared up many ambiguous issues relating to Brown's original work, and the somewhat elusive Biefeld–Brown effect. Construction. A simple ionocraft derivative, also known as a lifter, can be easily constructed by anyone with a minimal amount of technical knowledge. The model in its simplest form has the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides generally between 10 and 30 cm. They consist of three parts, the ""corona wire"" (or emitting wire), the ""air gap"" (or dielectric fluid), and the ""foil skirt"" (collector). The electrical polarities of the emitting and collecting electrodes can be reversed. All of this is usually supported by a lightweight balsawood or other electrically isolating frame so that the corona wire is supported at a fixed distance above the foil skirt, generally at 1 mm per kilovolt. The corona wire and foil should be as close as possible to achieve a saturated corona current condition which results in the highest production of thrust. However the corona wire should not be too close to the foil skirt as it will tend to arc in a spectacular show of tiny lightning bolts which has a twofold effect: Components. Corona wire. The corona wire is usually, but not necessarily, connected to the positive terminal of the high voltage power supply. In general, it is made from a small gauge bare conductive wire. While copper wire can be used, it does not work quite as well as stainless steel. Similarly, thinner wire such as 50 gauge tends to work well compared to more common, larger sizes such as 30 gauge, as the stronger electric field around the smaller diameter wire results in better ionisation and a larger corona current. The corona wire is so called because of its tendency to emit a purple corona-like glow while in use. This is simply a side effect of ionization. Excessive corona is to be avoided, as too much means the electrodes are dangerously close and may arc at any moment, not to mention the associated health hazards due to excess inhalation of ozone and NOx produced by the corona. Air gap. The air gap is simply that, a gap of free flowing air between the two electrodes that make up the structure of an ionocraft. The air gap is a vital necessity to the functioning of this device as it is the dielectric used during operation. Best results have been observed with an air gap of 1 mm to every kV. Collector. The collector may take various shapes, as long as it results in a smooth equipotential surface underneath the corona wire. Variations of this include a wire mesh, parallel conductive tubes, or a foil skirt with a smooth round edge. The foil skirt collector is the most popular for small models, and is usually, but not necessarily, connected to the negative side of the power supply. It is usually conveniently made from cheap, lightweight aluminum foil. The foil skirt is named simply because it is shaped much like a skirt, and is made from aluminum foil. It is by far the most fragile part, and must not be crumpled to work properly. Any sharp edges on the skirt will degrade the performance of the thruster, as this will generate ions of opposite polarity to those within the thrust mechanism. Reversing the polarities of the corona wire with that of the foil does not alter the direction of motion. Thrust will be produced regardless of whether the ions are positive or negative. For positive corona polarity, Nitrogen ions are the main charge carriers, whilst for negative polarity, Oxygen ions will be the main carriers and ozone production will be higher. The slight difference in their ion mobility, results in slightly higher thrust for the positive corona polarity case. Mechanism. The generated thrust can be explained in terms of electrokinetics or, in modern terms, electrohydrodynamics propulsion and can be derived through a modified use of the Child-Langmuir equation. A generalized one-dimensional treatment gives the equation: where In its basic form, the ionocraft is able to produce forces great enough to lift about a gram of payload per watt, so its use is restricted to a tethered model. Ionocraft capable of payloads in the order of a few grams usually need to be powered by power sources and high voltage converters weighing a few kilograms, so although its simplistic design makes it an excellent way to experiment with this technology, it is unlikely that a fully autonomous ionocraft will be made with the present construction methods. Further study in electrohydrodynamics, however, show that different classes and construction methods of EHD thrusters and hybrid technology (mixture with lighter than air techniques), can achieve much higher payload or thrust-to-power ratios than those achieved with the simple lifter design. Practical limits can be worked out using well defined theory and calculations such as those given on the 'Ionocraft mathematical analysis and design solutions' paper (see external links). Thus, a fully autonomous EHD thruster is theoretically possible. When the ionocraft is turned on, the corona wire becomes charged with high voltage, usually between 20 and 50 kV. The user must be extremely careful not to touch the device at this point, as it can give a nasty shock. At extremely high current, well over the amount usually used for a small model, contact could be fatal. When the corona wire is at approximately 30 kV, it causes the air molecules nearby to become ionised by stripping the electrons away from them. As this happens, the ions are strongly repelled away from the anode but are also strongly attracted towards the collector, causing the majority of the ions to begin accelerating in the direction of the collector. These ions travel at a constant average velocity termed the drift velocity. Such velocity depends on the mean free path between collisions, the external electric field, and on the mass of ions and neutral air molecules. The fact that the current is carried by a corona discharge (and not a tightly-confined arc) means that the moving particles are diffusely spread out into an expanding ion cloud, and collide frequently with neutral air molecules. It is these collisions that create a net movement. The momentum of the ion cloud is partially imparted onto the neutral air molecules that it collides with, which, being neutral, do not eventually migrate back to the second electrode. Instead they continue to travel in the same direction, creating a neutral wind. As these neutral molecules are ejected from the ionocraft, there are, in agreement with Newton's Third Law of Motion, equal and opposite forces, so the ionocraft moves in the opposite direction with an equal force. There are hundreds of thousands of molecules per second ejected from the device, so the force exerted is comparable to a gentle breeze. Still, this is enough to make a light balsa model lift its own weight. The resulting thrust also depends on other external factors including air pressure and temperature, gas composition, voltage, humidity, and air gap distance. The air gap is very important for the function of this device. Between the electrodes there is a mass of air, consisting of neutral air molecules, which gets in the way of the moving ions. This air mass is impacted repeatedly by excited particles moving at high drift velocity. This creates resistance, which must be overcome. The barrage of ions will eventually either push the whole mass of air out of the way, or break through to the collector where electrons will be reattached, making it neutral again. The end result of the neutral air caught in the process is to effectively cause an exchange in momentum and thus generate thrust. The heavier and denser the gas, the higher the resulting thrust. Recent research suggests electrohydrodynamic propulsion is more energy efficient than any other means of propulsion, generating up to 100N of thrust per kilowatt of power. Such high thrust to power ratio comes at a price of low power density, however. "

wikipedia-1280151," Brian Bellows  Brian Edward Bellows (born September 1, 1964) is a retired professional ice hockey player. He played nearly 1200 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Minnesota North Stars, Montreal Canadiens, Tampa Bay Lightning, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Washington Capitals. He was a member of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Montreal Canadiens. Playing career. Bellows played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the Kitchener Rangers. During this time, he was featured in ""Sports Illustrated"", which described him as the hottest prospect since Wayne Gretzky. Bellows was drafted second overall by the Minnesota North Stars, who had acquired the draft pick in a trade with Detroit with the purpose of having a shot at Bellows. North Stars GM Lou Nanne sent Don Murdoch, Greg Smith, and a first round pick (Murray Craven) to the Wings in exchange for what later turned out to be the second overall draft pick. Bellows was often compared to Gretzky, which led to a tough rookie season. The pressure of such comparisons caused criticisms when he did not live up to them. Bellows improved greatly in the second half of the season and finished with 35 goals. In the playoffs that year, Bellows scored 9 points (5 goals, 4 assists) in 9 games. Bellows played 10 seasons with the North Stars and was popular in Minnesota for his charity work, as well as his goal-scoring. He had a North Star record 342 goals in 753 games, peaking with 55 goals in 1989–90. In 1990–91, Bellows scored 29 points in the post-season to become the North Stars career playoff point leader, and took the North Stars to the Stanley Cup finals where they fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins. When team captain Craig Hartsburg was injured partway through the 1983–84 season, Bellows was named interim captain for the remainder of the season. At 19 years and 4 months, Bellows became captain at an earlier age than Gabriel Landeskog and Sidney Crosby. However, because he was an interim captain, Landeskog is still considered the youngest captain in history. On August 31, 1992, Bellows was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for Russ Courtnall. The trade angered Bellows at first, but he relished the chance to play for the Canadiens. Bellows remarked ""I hope to score more than last year. I want to come in and prove I can still play to the levels expected. I was shocked the trade but I'm excited about the new change. My idol was Ken Dryden. It's every kid's dream to play for the Canadiens."" In the 1992-93 NHL season his 88 points were the second highest season total of his career, and his 15 playoff points helped the Canadiens win the Stanley Cup in 1993. As his career was winding down, Bellows played for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Washington Capitals. In the 1997–98 NHL season the Capitals made it to the Stanley Cup finals, but lost to the Detroit Red Wings. En route to the Eastern Conference championship, Bellows scored the series-clinching overtime goal in the first round in Game 6 against the Boston Bruins. The 1998–99 season was his last. On January 2, 1999, Bellows scored his 1000th career regular season point, becoming the 54th NHL player to reach that plateau. Bellows was named to the 1990 Second All-Star team, and played in three NHL All-Star Games (1984, 1988 and 1992). He retired with 485 goals, 537 assists and 1,022 points. He was named the top forward at the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships, as Canada won the silver medal. External links.

George Argyros was born in Detroit, Michigan and raised in Pasadena, California. Argyros is a second-generation American citizen; his grandparents emigrated from Greece. Argyros graduated from Chapman University in 1959 with a major in Business and Economics. He later served on the board of trustees of that university, including chairman of the board from 1976 to 2001.  He is the Chairman and CEO of the board of trustees of California Institute of Technology, and also a board-member for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC. He and his wife of 40 years, Julia, have three grown children and seven grandchildren. Business. Argyros made his fortune in real estate investments. He originally started his business career running a grocery store and moved on to buying and selling real estate to gas stations. He also was involved in buying and selling property in Southern California. From 1981 to 1989 he was the owner of the Seattle Mariners baseball team. He has been on the board of directors of many corporations. Argyros recently has done business through the real estate company Arnel & Affiliates (DBA ""Arnel Property Management Company""), which manages apartments and invests in commercial property. Arnel & Affiliates does business primarily in Southern California. Through his business practices Argyros has achieved a net worth around $1 billion. In 2001 Arnel and Argyros were named in a civil complaint alleging Arnel Management ""systematically withheld tenants' security deposits"". Soon after its filing, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas terminated the district attorney's investigation and removed Argyros' name from the case, saying ""I felt we had a strong case against the company and it would weaken the case include Argyros."" This decision was attacked after it was discovered that Argyros had contributed $30,000 to Rackauckas's campaign. Argyros was confirmed as ambassador to Spain shortly after this case settled. Politics. Argyros served as a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations for the U.S. Trade Ambassador, resigning that position in 1990, when President Bush appointed him to the board of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FreddieMac). He completed his term on the FreddieMac Board in March 1993. In 2001 Argyros was appointed Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. He was sworn in on November 21, 2001. Many viewed the appointment as a political reward for his fund raising efforts for the Republican Party. Baseball. In 1981, Argyros bought the Seattle Mariners. The team had struggled from inception in 1977 as an expansion team. He ran the team on a shoestring budget and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. Argyros sold the team to Jeff Smulyan in 1989. "

He was honoured by his hometown of Alma, which named its local arena ""Le Centre Mario-Tremblay"". Since 1981, Tremblay has owned the sports bar in his hometown called ""Bar-Restaurant chez Mario Tremblay"". Playing career. Tremblay, nicknamed ""Le bleuet bionique"" (The Bionic Blueberry), played with the Montreal Canadiens for his entire NHL playing career (1974 to 1986), and was also the coach of the club from 1995 until his resignation in 1997, winning five Stanley Cup championships with the team as a player in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1986. He scored the winning goal in game six of the Stanley finals giving the cup to the Canadiens in 1978. He was the winner of the Molson Cup for the season 1982-83. Although his playing days have been overshadowed by his controversial coaching career, Tremblay is 10th on the Montreal Canadiens all time list for plus-minus at 184. In 852 regular season games in the NHL, he scored 258 goals and added 326 assists for 584 points, with 1043 penalty minutes. Coaching career. Tremblay was hired four games into the 1995–96 season as head coach of the Canadiens although he had no previous coaching experience. As coach, he developed a long running dispute with star goaltender Patrick Roy, which eventually led to Roy's departure from Montreal. The two had almost come to blows in a Long Island coffee shop before Tremblay was announced as a coach and his first appearance in the dressing room was greeted with snickers from Roy. They almost fought a second time after Tremblay fired a shot at Roy's throat during practice, by which point it was only a matter of time before the hot-tempered Tremblay and his star goalie reached the point of no return. Tremblay kept Patrick Roy in net during a December 2, 1995, game versus the Detroit Red Wings, in which the Wings scored 9 goals on Roy, who was jeered by the Montreal fans. Roy stormed off the ice and told team president Ronald Corey that it was the last game he would play for the Canadiens. Two days later, Roy was traded to Colorado with captain Mike Keane for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky and Andrei Kovalenko. Roy went on to lead the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup twice before retiring. Nearly a year later, Tremblay also had a heated verbal exchange with Canadiens enforcer Donald Brashear during a team practice prior to a game against the Avalanche in Denver. Brashear was later traded to the Vancouver Canucks. As a head coach for Montreal, Tremblay coached 159 games, with 71 wins, 63 losses and 25 ties across two years with the team. Prior to his 2009–10 hiring as assistant-coach of the New Jersey Devils, Tremblay served as an assistant coach for the Minnesota Wild. In both jobs, he was an assistant coach to Jacques Lemaire. After Lemaire retired in 2010, Tremblay was not retained as assistant coach. He then joined the Quebec sport network RDS as a hockey analyst for the Montreal Canadiens games. References.

wikipedia-1280212," Jocelyn Thibault  Jocelyn Thibault (Tee-BOW) (born January 12, 1975) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Quebec Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche, Montreal Canadiens, Chicago Blackhawks, Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres. Thibault was born in Montreal, Quebec, but grew up in Laval, Quebec. He led a group out of Sherbrooke, Quebec to create an expansion team in the QMJHL. The new team, Sherbrooke Phoenix, started playing in the 2012–13 season. Playing career. He was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques 10th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He went on to play for the Nordiques, continuing for a short time after they moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. In 1995, midway through the Avalanche's first season in Denver, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in the trade that moved Patrick Roy to the Avalanche. Thibault played two seasons with the Canadiens before being traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in November 1998.  Thibault played his longest stretch with any one team with the Blackhawks—five seasons. His best season was the 2002–03 season when he recorded eight shutouts and made an appearance in the 2003 NHL All-Star Game. He recorded his career best GAA of 2.37 and a save percentage of .915. After the lockout, Thibault was acquired by the Pittsburgh Penguins in August 2005, for a fourth round pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft on a two-year contract worth $3m. However, a hip injury contributed to a bad beginning, with the veteran losing twelve of thirteen starts. He was replaced as the starter by Marc-André Fleury in late November and put on waivers.

wikipedia-1280214," EMD E9  The E9 was a , A1A-A1A passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division of La Grange, Illinois between April 1954 and January 1964. 100 cab-equipped A units were produced and 44 cabless booster B units, all for service in the United States. The E9 was the tenth and last model of EMD E-unit and differed from the earlier E8 as built only by the newer engines and a different, flusher-fitting mounting for the headlight glass, the latter being the only visible difference. Since some E8s were fitted with this, it is not a reliable way to distinguish the two. The E9 had two , V12 model 567C engines, each engine driving one generator to power two traction motors. Engine and powertrain. The E9 used twin 12 cylinder 567C engines developing a total of 2,400 hp at 800 r.p.m. Designed specifically for railroad locomotives, this supercharged 2 stroke 45 degree V type, with an 8 1/2"" bore by 10"" stroke giving 567 cubic inches displacement per cylinder, remained in production until 1966. Two D.C. generators, one per engine, provide power to four motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used on all E units and on MP 7100 and CB&Q 9908 power cars. EMD has built all of its major components since 1939. Operation. The E9 powered American passenger and mail trains from the 1950s into the late 1970s. Many of America's finest trains — such as Union Pacific Railroad's ""City"" fleet, Burlington's ""Zephyr"" fleet and Southern Pacific Railroad's ""Coast Daylight"" and ""Sunset Limited"" — had E9s pulling them. E9s and their E7 and E8 kin ran throughout the country on lesser-known passenger trains, Chicago's network of commuter trains and many mail and express trains. As America's passenger train network shrank due to unprofitibility, Union Pacific, Rock Island and Illinois Central Railroad began using E9s on freight trains.  Amtrak, founded in 1971, bought 36 E9As and 23 E9Bs from the Union Pacific, Milwaukee Road, B&O and SCL. Amtrak used the E9s until the late 1970s and converted some E9B units to steam generator and head end power cars. Surviving examples. Many E9s survive today. According to Andrew Toppan's list of March 5, 1997, 42 survive. Four E9s are owned by the Illinois Railway Museum, in Union, Illinois. A number of railroads keep a small number in service for hauling inspection specials, charter passenger trains, investor tours, and the like. The Union Pacific Railroad rosters three, (951, 949, and 963B), which have been re-engined with single EMD 16-645E engines for commonality with other UP power and thus ease of maintenance. "
wikipedia-1280224," Mathieu Flamini  Mathieu Flamini (born 7 March 1984) is a French footballer who plays for Premier League club Arsenal as a midfielder. According to Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, he is a player with a fantastic work rate and great mentality who can play as a defensive midfielder or as a cover at full-back.  Club career. Marseille. Flamini was a youth team player for his local professional club Marseille. He made his debut for the senior team on 20 December 2003 in the 1–0 victory over Toulouse FC. He impressed the team as a hardworking midfield player and played 14 times for the club. However, it was his performances in Marseille’s UEFA Cup campaign that brought him to the attention of the football world, including the semi-final victory over Newcastle United. He played in the final in Gothenburg which Valencia won 2–0. Due to his age, Marseille was unable to offer him a long term professional contract. Arsenal. On 23 July 2004, Flamini signed a professional contract for English outfit Arsenal, rejecting Marseille's long-term senior contract offer to which he had already verbally agreed. Soon after the incident, Marseille manager José Anigo stated, ""This is a beautiful treason. He used me.""  Flamini made his Arsenal début in the 4–1 win at Everton on 15 August 2004. He was used as a utility player starting 9 games but being used as a substitute in 12. The following season saw him filling in for a number of injured players, but unable to command a first team place in his favoured position. He scored his first Arsenal goal on 11 May 2005 in a 7–0 win against Everton scoring the seventh goal, that was Arsenal's last ever goal scored in their original Red and White kit at Highbury. In the 2006–07 season, Flamini scored the winning goal against Dinamo Zagreb in the qualifying stages of the Champions League. He also scored important goals against Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, and Liverpool in the Premiership. However, despite these important goals, he remained unsatisfied with his ""utility player"" role at the club and in April 2007, he admitted that he would probably be leaving Arsenal in the summer. However, Flamini turned down a proposed £3m move to Birmingham City and remained with the team. Flamini started in central midfield for Arsenal's first match of the 2007–08 Premier League season, due to the absence of Gilberto Silva and Abou Diaby. During Arsenal's 2007–08 campaign, he struck up a strong partnership with Cesc Fàbregas, keeping Gilberto out of the starting XI with displays widely regarded by Arsenal fans as a vast improvement on those during his previous years at the club. Flamini enjoyed a generally good rapport with Arsenal's fans, who provided him with his own song, an adaptation of the theme tune to British television programme The Sweeney. On 29 January 2008, he scored an extraordinary strike in Arsenal's 3–0 win over Newcastle United in the Premier League. He played on 8 April 2008, a UEFA Champions League match in which Arsenal were knocked out by English rival Liverpool F.C. After the match, he was reported injured and it proved to be his last match for Arsenal. In April 2009, he stated in an interview that he is still an Arsenal fan and that he has no hard feelings towards the club, ""Arsenal are in my heart and they will be in my heart for ever,"" he said. ""I will always be an Arsenal fan and leaving was not easy."" Milan. Flamini signed a contract with A.C. Milan on May 5, 2008. Flamini wore the number 84 on his shirt to represent his year of birth. He made his Serie A debut on 30 August 2008 in a 2–1 loss to Bologna. Initially, Flamini did not enjoy the number of starts or appearances for the Italian team as he enjoyed in his last season at Arsenal; he was regarded as a utility player at Milan as he was during his first few years at Arsenal. Nevertheless, injuries to other players and his consistent good form helped him to cement a starting place at San Siro. With Milan failing to find a stable defence and a lack of a fit, consistent, and reliable right back, Gianluca Zambrotta was switched to the left flank to help Flamini develop as a tenacious right back. After stating that his preferred position is in the midfield, Milan have since re-deployed him as a defensive midfielder. Flamini saw limited playing time towards the end of 2009–10 season due to the great form of club captain Massimo Ambrosini. In the following season, Flamini became an important asset of the team that would win the 18th scudetto, playing many games as starter, and scoring two goals, against Bari and Bologna, respectively. After playing as a rotation role in the 2010–11 season he injured himself in a pre-season training session, suffering a serious knee injury which required an operation. Flamini spent the entire 2011–12 season out. On 20 June 2012, It was confirmed by the club that he had left following the expiration of his contract, as they had ended negotiations with the player, and so he became a free agent. Two weeks later Flamini and Adriano Galliani reached a new agreement for a one-year contract, with the Frenchman taking a significant cut in his wages. On 7 April 2013, Flamini scored his first goal of the season, and Milan's second goal in a 2–2 draw against Fiorentina. Return to Arsenal. Flamini began training with Arsenal midway in early August, reportedly, solely to maintain his fitness with a view to signing for a club in England. Immediately it sparked media attention with claims rising that he would soon sign for Arsenal but these reports were shunned by many journalist by pointing out that many other ex Arsenal players had returned to train with Arsenal including Robert Pires and Thierry Henry.  Flamini signed for Arsenal on 29 August 2013 and became Arsenal's second signing of the summer. He made his returning debut on 1 September 2013 at the Emirates Stadium against Tottenham Hotspur coming on for Jack Wilshere, helping the team secure a 1–0 win. International career. Flamini accepted his first call up to France by coach Raymond Domenech for a friendly against Argentina at the Stade de France on 7 February 2007 after Jérémy Toulalan was ruled out due to injury. He later made his international debut in a friendly against Morocco on 16 November 2007 as a substitute. Honours. Arsenal Milan "

wikipedia-1280407," The Dick Cavett Show  The Dick Cavett Show has been the title of several talk shows hosted by Dick Cavett on various television networks, including: Cavett filmed his programs in New York City. Show history. ""The Dick Cavett Show"" most often refers to the shows on ABC-TV that Dick Cavett hosted between 1968 and 1975 in New York. The first daytime show featured Gore Vidal, Muhammad Ali, and Angela Lansbury. ABC pressured Cavett to ""get big names,"" although subsequent shows without them got higher ratings and more critical acclaim. The late-night talk show that ran from December 29, 1969 to January 1, 1975 ran opposite NBC's ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"". Cavett took the time slot over from Joey Bishop. In addition to the usual monologue, Cavett opened each show reading selected questions written by audience members, to which he would respond with witty rejoinders. (""What makes New York so crummy these days?"" ""Tourists."") While Cavett and Carson shared many of the same guests, Cavett was receptive to rock and roll artists to a degree unusual at the time, as well as authors, politicians, and other personalities outside the entertainment field. The wide variety of guests, combined with Cavett's literate and intelligent approach to comedy, appealed to a significant enough number of viewers to keep the show running for several years despite the competition from Carson's show. The late-night show's 45-minute midpoint would always be signaled by the musical piece ""Glitter and Be Gay"" from Leonard Bernstein's ""Candide."" The ""Candide"" snippet became Cavett's theme song, being used as the introduction to his later PBS series, and was played by the house band on his various talk show appearances over the last 30 years. Typically each show had several guests, but occasionally Cavett would devote an entire show to a single guest. Among those receiving such special treatment (some more than once) were Groucho Marx, Laurence Olivier, Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn (without an audience), Bette Davis, Orson Welles, Noël Coward (who appeared on the same show along with Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford), John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Alfred Hitchcock, Fred Astaire, Woody Allen, Gloria Swanson, Jerry Lewis, Lucille Ball, Zero Mostel (""on some shows I've had just one guest, but tonight I have Zero"") and David Bowie. These shows helped showcase Cavett's skills as a host who could attract guests that otherwise might not do interviews, at the expense of some of the excitement that might ensue from the multiple-guest format. In January 1973, despite a vociferous letter campaign, ratings forced the show to be cut back to occasional status, airing one week a month under the umbrella title ""ABC's Wide World of Entertainment"". Jack Paar, who ABC had tried to recruit as Cavett's successor, insisted that both he and Cavett get at least one week per month as a sign of respect for Cavett. By the end of 1974, it was airing only twice a month. The PBS series featured single guests in a half-hour format and was produced by Christopher Porterfield, a former roommate of Cavett's at Yale University who had coauthored the book ""Cavett"" published in August 1974. The show remained on the PBS lineup until affiliates voted it off the schedule in 1982. On all three of the early ABC shows, the bandleader was Bobby Rosengarden and the announcer was Fred Foy of ""The Lone Ranger"" fame. The morning show was produced by Woody Fraser and the late-night show by John Gilroy. Cavett's writer was Dave Lloyd.  ""The Dick Cavett Show"" was also the name of a short-lived radio show. Notable moments. March 4, 1968: The Premiere of ""This Morning"". In the first broadcast of his 90-minute morning show, Cavett had as his first guest, engineer/designer/futurist Buckminster Fuller. The two discussed how politicians would eventually become obsolete through technological advances, while the wide-ranging discussion also included a comment from Fuller that a woman is a baby factory and that a man's role is to simply press the right button. Later on in the program, Cavett chatted with actress Patricia Neal, who discussed her long rehabilitation from a near-fatal stroke in 1965. March 27, 1968: Christine Jorgensen walks off the show. During an interview with Christine Jorgensen, the first widely known person to have a sex reassignment surgery (in this case male-to-female), she walked off the show when she felt offended when Cavett asked her about the status of her romantic life with her ""wife""; because she was the only scheduled guest, Cavett spent the rest of that show talking about how he had not meant to offend her. August 19, 1969: The Woodstock Show. On Tuesday, August 19, 1969, Jefferson Airplane, Joni Mitchell, and David Crosby and Stephen Stills (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young), all appeared on The Dick Cavett Show. It is now often referred to as ""The Woodstock Show"", as many of the performers, and Cavett's audience, came directly from the concert for the taping the afternoon before the show aired. Stephen Stills pointed out the mud from the concert venue still on his pantleg. Jefferson Airplane's performance ""We Can Be Together"" marked the first time the word ""fuck"" was uttered on live television in the US. Joni Mitchell sang ""Chelsea Morning"", ""Willy"", and ""For Free"". Grace Slick kept calling Dick Cavett ""Jim"" and briefly talked about her school days at Finch College. Stephen Stills performed ""4 + 20"". Joni Mitchell sang ""The Fiddle and the Drum"" a cappella. Jefferson Airplane (with David Crosby) then launched into ""Somebody to Love"". The credits rolled as everybody, aside from Mitchell, partook in an instrumental jam as the audience danced. Jimi Hendrix was scheduled to join the others but was unable to appear at the afternoon taping that occurred only a few hours after he performed at the late-running festival. Joni Mitchell's manager, apparently fearing a similar situation that may have prevented her from appearing on ""The Dick Cavett Show"", did not allow her to perform at Woodstock. He considered the ""Cavett Show"" too important for her career for her to risk missing the taping. Mitchell wrote the song ""Woodstock"" based on descriptions by Graham Nash and from the images she saw on television, as she could not be there in person. The most famous version of the song is by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, who recorded it for their ""Déjà Vu"" album (1970). It appears in the film ""Woodstock"" during the closing credits. Mitchell recorded it for ""Ladies of the Canyon"" (1970). September 5, 1969: Groucho Marx. Groucho Marx remarked about the musical ""Hair"", which had just opened and was notorious for its ground-breaking use of explicit nudity: ""I was going to go, but I saw myself in the mirror one morning, and I figured, why waste five and a half dollars?"" September 9, 1969: Jimi Hendrix. In an interview with Jimi Hendrix, Cavett spoke about Hendrix's performance of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" at Woodstock, and called the style ""unorthodox"". Jimi commented that the song was ""not unorthodox"" and that what he played was beautiful. The audience clapped, and Dick blushed. In this interview, Hendrix modestly downplays his abilities and displays his sense of humor. Perhaps most importantly, he reveals some of his aesthetic ideals and the purpose of his music as he viewed it then when he discussed his concept of the “Electric Church”: ""is getting to be more spiritual than anything now. Pretty soon I believe that they are going to have to rely on music to get some kind of peace of mind or satisfaction—direction, actually—more so than politics, because politics is really on an ego scene…[Politics is the art of words, which means nothing. So, therefore you have to rely on more of an earthier substance like music or the arts, theater, acting, painting, whatever…Electric Church is a belief that I have. We do use electric guitars. Everything is electrified nowadays. So, therefore the belief comes through electricity to people. That’s why we play so loud. Because it doesn’t actually hit through the eardrums like most groups do nowadays. They say ‘Well, we’re going to play loud too, because they’re playing loud.’ And they’ve got this real shrill sound that’s really hard. We plan for our sound to go inside the soul of the person…and see if they can awaken some sort of thing in their minds, because there are so many sleeping people."" February 4, 1970: Judy Collins. During an interview with singer Judy Collins, which discussed her experiences as a defense witness at the Chicago Seven trial, several of her comments were censored at the direction of the ABC legal department. Collins wrote a protest letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), claiming a violation of her free speech rights and the network license granted to ABC by the FCC. Her protest was denied, with the FCC ruling that a television network could, at its discretion, delete or edit remarks on its programs. Elton Rule, president of ABC Television, noted that in the network's judgement, ""her remarks ... were not within the bounds of fair comment."" February 19, 1970: Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford. To honor Noël Coward on the occasion of his being knighted, Cavett interviewed not only ""The Master"" himself, but also his close friends, The Lunts. Tammy Grimes and Brian Bedford, who were appearing on Broadway at the time in a revival of Coward's classic play, ""Private Lives"", performed a medley of Sir Noel's most popular songs. At one point during the interview, Cavett asked Coward, ""What is the word for when one has terrific, prolific qualities?"" Without missing a beat, Coward answered in a deadpan manner, ""Talent"", which sent Cavett and the audience into convulsions of laughter. March 6, 1970: Salvador Dalí, Lillian Gish, and Satchel Paige. Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí appeared on the show with silent screen star Lillian Gish and baseball legend Satchel Paige. Dalí carried an anteater on a leash in with him when he came on stage, and he tossed it in Gish's lap, much to her consternation. Cavett asked Dalí why he had once arrived to give a lecture at the Sorbonne in an open limousine filled with heads of cauliflower. Dalí responded with a barely-coherent discourse regarding the similarity of the cauliflower head to the ""mathematical problem discovered by Michelangelo in the rhinoceros' horn"". Cavett interrupted him by waving his hands in Dalí's face, exclaiming ""Boogie boogie boogie!"" (imitating Groucho Marx in the film ""A Night at the Opera""). The audience broke up, and Dalí appeared at a loss. April 6, 1970: Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. Actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin appeared together on the show with movie producer Mel Brooks and movie critic Rex Reed. Their interview went extremely poorly from the outset with Frechette giving abrupt non-conversational answers, and Halprin staying silent. Cavett apparently believed they lived in a commune, when they in fact were followers of cult leader Mel Lyman. When Cavett asked about the ""commune"" they lived in, Frechette ""categorically"" denied that it was a commune and said that ""The community is for one purpose, and that's to serve Mel Lyman, who's the leader and founder of that community."" At that point, Halprin finally tried to speak, but Cavett went to commercial. When the show returned from commercial, the next guest was brought out, and Frechette and Halprin were not interviewed further. December 18, 1970: Lester Maddox Walks Off the Show. Former Georgia governor Lester Maddox, appearing in a panel discussion along with author Truman Capote and football great Jim Brown, walked off the show in the middle of a conversation about segregation after Cavett refused to apologize to Maddox's satisfaction. Cavett had made a reference to the ""bigots"" who had elected Maddox. Following a give-and-take about how insulting the remark might have been and Maddox's demand for an apology, Cavett had finally apologized to those Georgians who had supported Maddox who might not be bigots. Not satisfied, Maddox left the studio. During the hastily called commercial break, Cavett tried to coax Maddox back to no avail. Cavett suspected that the behavior was mere showmanship and a calculated publicity stunt. The incident was reported on the news before it aired that night, increasing viewership. In Greenwood, Mississippi, the hometown of Cavett's wife Carrie Nye, the guests at a country club dance abandoned the dance floor to watch the show on the TV in the lounge.  Capote, after watching Maddox walk offstage, paused and quipped, ""I've been to his restaurant and his chicken isn't that finger lickin' good."" Years later, Cavett said he got more comments about the show (including some 6,000 pieces of hate mail) than any other he had done. Maddox later returned for another appearance on the show, and this time Cavett walked off as a joke. Left alone on stage, Maddox cued the band and began singing ""I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do"" as Cavett reappeared in the wings to join in. The walk-off incident is mentioned at the beginning of the Randy Newman song ""Rednecks."" June 7, 1971: J. I. Rodale's Onstage Death. As noted in Cavett's autobiography (p. 321-323), on June 7, 1971 publisher J. I. Rodale, an advocate of organic farming, died of a heart attack during taping. Cavett was speaking with journalist Pete Hamill when Rodale began to make a snoring noise. Cavett's reaction to this is contested - he claims that both he and Hammill realized immediately that something was wrong, while other accounts have him addressing the unconscious man with ""Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?"" The audience did not realise anything was seriously wrong until Cavett asked (avoiding the cliché), ""Is there a doctor...""in the audience?"""" The program was never aired and a rerun was aired in its place. June 1971: Vietnam War Debate with John Kerry. During a debate about the Vietnam war, Cavett had two veterans debating on the show. The anti-war side was led by a young John Kerry and the pro-war side by John E. O'Neill, later the founder of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. It was later revealed through then-President Richard Nixon's secret White House tapes that Nixon wanted to ""get rid"" of Cavett because of this debate. August 2, 1971: Ingmar Bergman. Director Ingmar Bergman appeared for the first time on a US talk show, in one of the few TV interviews he ever agreed to do. November 24, 1971: Danny Kaye. Actor singer Danny Kaye appeared for the entire show with film clips, performing and promoting UNICEF. December 15, 1971: Norman Mailer vs. Gore Vidal. Moments before the episode with Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, and Janet Flanner, Mailer, annoyed with a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of ""Prisoner of Sex"", headbutted Vidal and traded insults with him backstage. As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted he had been drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his ""greater intellect"". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced that the discussion had become ""extremely boring"", telling Mailer ""You act as if you're the only people here."" Mailer moved his chair away from the other guests and Cavett joked that ""perhaps you'd like two more chairs to contain your giant intellect?"" Mailer replied ""I'll take the two chairs if you'll all accept finger-bowls."" As Cavett professed to not understand Mailer's ""finger bowl"" comment and made further jokes, Mailer stated ""Why don't you look at your question sheet and ask your question?"", to which Cavett responded ""Why don't you fold it 5 ways and put it where the moon don't shine?""  A long laugh by the audience ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had ""come up with that line himself"". Cavett replied ""I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?"" The headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his short book ""Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots"", including a description that does not jibe with the videotape and was disputed by Cavett decades later in his New York Times Online column. Cavett noted that Mailer said that he received more mail about this episode than anything else in his career. 1971: John Simon vs. Mort Sahl. Critic John Simon revealed on the air to the home audience that during the most recent commercial break, fellow guest Mort Sahl had threatened to punch him in the mouth. 1971: The Pornography Episodes. Cavett did a two-part show on pornography; both parts were taped the same day and shown on two nights. During the first part, he was discussing the depiction of oral sex in movies and made a parenthetical utterance: ""oral-genital sex...mouth on sex organs."" A flap ensued where executives demanded that the censor cut the second phrase. An angry Cavett described the ongoing situation at the beginning of the second part, reusing the phrase. One of the guests, legal scholar Alexander Bickel, sided with Cavett. The result was that the show aired with the phrase cut the first night but left in the second night. March 31, 1972: Chad Everett vs. Lily Tomlin. During the filming of this episode, actor Chad Everett had a much publicized argument with feminist actress/comedienne Lily Tomlin. Tomlin became so enraged when Everett referred to his wife as ""my property"" that she stormed off the set and refused to return. June 27, 1972: Angela Davis. Angela Davis, an activist who was associated with the Black Panther Party in the 1960s and 1970s, cancelled a scheduled appearance on June 27, 1972. The basis for the controversy was the continuing debate over the SST (Supersonic transport) system. ABC had insisted on inviting either William F. Buckley, Jr. or William Rusher of the conservative ""National Review"" magazine to have a balanced viewpoint, but Davis declined. 1972: Rogers Morton. A show with Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton resulted in nine animals being added to the endangered species list after Cavett commented on them. June 12, 1973: Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando, who just months earlier had rejected his Academy Award for ""The Godfather"" to protest the plight of American Indians, appeared on the show with representatives of the Cheyenne, Paiute, and Lummi tribes to promote his views. After the program ended, Brando assaulted photographer Ron Galella who ended up in the hospital after being punched in the face. October 1973: Katharine Hepburn 2-Hour Interview. During a two-part interview with Katharine Hepburn, Hepburn got up and left at the end of the first half of the interview, thinking her job was done. Cavett apologized to the audience, promising she would be back the next evening (she was). However, this was actually staged by Cavett and Hepburn as a joke. 1979: Oscar Peterson. A piano lesson with Oscar Peterson. Oscar Peterson exposed the styles of Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, George Shearing with an amazing facility. The show began with Peterson playing a solo piece and then he discussed his debut and view on critics. DVD release. Five DVD sets have been released featuring various episodes of the series.

wikipedia-1280440," Arnon Milchan  Arnon Milchan (; December 6, 1944) is an Israeli Hollywood film producer who has produced over 120 full-length motion pictures. Mr. Milchan is also a former key Israeli intelligence operative from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. Milchan's films include ""The War of the Roses"", ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Under Siege"", ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""The Fountain"", ""Unfaithful"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and many others. He is an Israeli citizen, and a resident of Israel. Life and career. Milchan was born in Rehovot, British Mandate for Palestine, in 1944. His family was Jewish. His father owned a fertilizer company, which Milchan turned into a successful chemical business. He also earned a degree from the London School of Economics, before being recruited to LAKAM, a top secret Israeli intelligence organization responsible for obtaining technology and material for Israel's nuclear program, and other highly secretive programs.  Milchan became involved in the American movie business in 1977, after an introduction to American producer Elliot Kastner. Most notable among Milchan's film collaborations was his early work with Martin Scorsese. He developed close friendships with Robert De Niro, and directors Roman Polanski, Sergio Leone, Terry Gilliam and Oliver Stone. Milchan started his own production company in 1991 called ""New Regency Productions"". Through his company Regency, in partnership with Warner Brothers, and later with Rupert Murdoch at 20th Century Fox, and other business ventures, such as Puma AG, Milchan attained a net worth estimated at about $4.2 billion as of 2013, and is listed as the 290th richest person in the world and fourth in Israel by Forbes.  Arnon Milchan has produced many films such as ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984) (in which he also makes a cameo appearance as the chauffeur), ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Pretty Woman"" (1990), ""Under Siege"" (1992), ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994), ""Boys on the Side"" (1995), ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997), ""Unfaithful"" (2002), and ""Knight and Day"" (2010), among others. Speculation about Milchan's involvement in arms dealing and intelligence activities was sparked after ""the indictment in 1985 of Richard Kelly Smyth, an aerospace executive who had made illegal shipments of Krytrons (nuclear triggers) through one of Milchan's companies."" This remained hearsay until biographers Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman confirmed in a book published July 2011, that Milchan was indeed involved in espionage and arms-dealing. The research in Confidential - The Life Of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon established that ""at least through the mid-1980s was a full-fledged operative for Israel’s top-secret intelligence agency, Lakam. His activities included ""buying components to build and maintain Israel’s nuclear arsenal"" and supervising ""government-backed accounts and front companies that financed the special needs of the entirety of Israel’s intelligence operations outside the country."". Interviewed regarding Milchan's intelligence activities, Israeli President Shimon Peres stated: ""Arnon is a special man. It was I who recruited him... When I was at the Ministry of Defense, Arnon was involved in numerous defense-related procurement activities and intelligence operations. His strength is in making connections at the highest levels... His activities gave us a huge advantage, strategically, diplomatically and technologically."" (interview dated February 8, 2010, documented in Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman's ""Confidential: Secret Agent turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan"" p. xi) Milchan is also the owner of the WTA broadcasting rights. He was married to model Brigitte Genmaire. He is now married to former South African tennis professional Amanda Coetzer.

wikipedia-1280458," Marginal revenue  In microeconomics, marginal revenue (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by 1 unit. It can also be described as the unit revenue the last item sold has generated for the firm. In a perfectly competitive market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good. This is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price. However, a monopoly determines the entire industry's sales. As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit. Therefore the Marginal Revenue generated is always less (lower) than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells. The marginal revenue (the increase in total revenue) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. Definition. Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small. More formally, define the revenue function to be the following By the product rule, marginal revenue is then given by For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (formula_3), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a monopoly, the price decreases with quantity sold (formula_4), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive formula_5). Marginal revenue curve. The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate. Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity. The relationship between marginal revenue and the elasticity of demand by the firm's customers can be derived as follows: where e is the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic (e  > 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price. Marginal revenue and rule of thumb pricing. Profit maximization requires that a firm produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.  Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand. Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as: Thus if e is - 2 and MC is $5.00 then price is $10.00. ( - C')/  = - 1/e is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner. The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost. The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic. Real life example: if you can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then your marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9. "
wikipedia-1280478," Schrader valve  The Schrader valve (also called American valve) is a brand of pneumatic tyre valve used on virtually every motor vehicle in the world today. The Schrader company, for which it was named, was founded in 1844 by August Schrader. The original Schrader valve design was patented in the United States in 1893. The Schrader valve consists of a valve stem into which a valve core is threaded, and is used on virtually all automobile tyres and motorcycle tyres and most wider rimmed bicycle tyres. The valve core is a poppet valve assisted by a spring. Uses. In addition to tube and tubeless tyres, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration and air conditioning systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and test port on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to riders weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft. Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurised content. Valve. A Schrader valve consists of an externally threaded hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically of brass. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is approximately flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves used on tyres have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all common applications. The core of the valve can be removed or tightened with a tool. A new development is Schrader valve stems with integrated transmitters for tyre pressure monitoring systems (TPMS). Cap. A valve cap is important on a Schrader valve because if one is not fitted, dirt and water can enter the outside of the valve, potentially jamming it or contaminating the sealing surfaces and causing a leak. Rock salt and other chemical de-icers used in the winter are especially damaging for the brass components in the Schrader valve. Some valve caps have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside to help make a hermetic seal (airtight seal). Such a rubber-washer-sealing-type cap also helps prevent air from escaping from a slightly leaking valve. In addition, the rubber washer prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the cap and the valve stem and in this way damping the vibrations. The caps without these rubber-washer seals inside them effectively serve mostly to keep contaminants out of the valve stem, without providing a good hermetic seal. The caps without rubber washers inside them can also loosen and fall off due to vibrations when undertightened, especially if they are made of hard plastic or hard-plastic-lined metal. Valve caps are mostly made of black plastic and also of metal or plastic-lined metal, with rubber washers found inside some caps made of plastic and most metal caps. However, to prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS (tyre-pressure-monitoring system) and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should never be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tyre valve stems. Therefore, only plastic caps or metal caps with plastic linings should be used in direct-TPMS-equipped tyre valve stems. Moreover, metal valve caps without plastic linings can also cause corrosion and may become stuck to the valve and require breaking of the valve in order to remove it when the cap metal (such as brass) is different than the valve metal (such as aluminium). When the valve caps are installed, care must be made not to leave them loose, as they may not seal properly and may even come loose and fall off. Overtightening the valve caps might damage the rubber washer inside the cap, damage or break the cap itself, or damage the valve. Also, installing the cap at a slight angle can cause stripping of the threads and, therefore, it should be gently finger-tightened while ensuring that it is straight and the threads aren't stripped. There are also special pressure monitoring valve caps available that use a spring-loaded piston to raise a green flag when the pressure is at or above the correct setting. Upon losing pressure the green flag is retracted to reveal a red pin, hopefully catching the attention of the owner before fuel is wasted or safety is compromised by running the tyre under-inflated. Recently, colored plastic valve caps have appeared. Certain automobile tyre dealerships are promoting the use of dry nitrogen to inflate tyres. Dealers claim that eliminating oxygen and water will prolong the life of both tyres and wheels. These dealers install green caps to signify that the tyres are filled with nearly pure (typically about 95%) nitrogen. In contrast, regular air is approximately 78% nitrogen. The moisture in the air-filled tyres condenses in below-freezing temperatures and causes a sudden drop in tyre pressure. Dry-nitrogen filling helps prevent this problem. As an alternative to green nitrogen-ID (nitrogen-identification) caps, green nitrogen-ID O-rings to be installed on valve stems under the caps, while still using black- or metallic-colored caps, are also available. Other vendors sell caps in a variety of other colors for purely decorative purposes, including (usually battery-powered) caps that light up when the wheels move. When used on a bicycle, the illuminated type are claimed (by the manufacturers) to enhance night-time and twilight rider safety by improving their visibility to other road users. Presta valves vs. Schrader valves. Whereas Schrader valves are almost universal on car tyres, bicycle tubes have Dunlop, Schrader or Presta valves. Both the Schrader and the Presta types are good at sealing high pressures. Their chief differences are that Schrader valves are larger and have springs that close the valve except when the pin is depressed. Schrader valves are used in a wide variety of compressed gas and pressurized liquid applications. Presta valve stems are 6 mm diameter, whereas Schrader valve stems for bicycle tyres are 8 mm, thus requiring a larger diameter hole in a bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the air chuck must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation, whereas the Presta valve relies solely on internal air pressure to keep it shut. This means that some air is lost while attaching and detaching pumps to Schrader valves, although this is usually nominal (most of the air which makes the ""whooshing"" noise when the pump is removed comes from the compressed air in the tube between the pump body and the attachment end, not the tyre via the momentarily-open Schrader valve). To fill up a bicycle tyre with a Presta-valved tube at a gas station requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Dimensions. Schrader valves are classified by their material, diameter of intended rim hole, length, and shape. and also : The standard Schrader valve has the following threads: External thread Internal thread (to accept the threaded valve core) For refrigeration, a 1/4"" male flare fitting is used, with the same internal thread as above.

wikipedia-1280528," Feria  A feria (Latin for ""free day"") was a day on which the people, especially the slaves, were not obliged to work, and on which there were no court sessions. In ancient Rome the ""feriae publicae"", legal holidays, were either ""stativae"" (""fixed,"" that is, recurring regularly, such as the Saturnalia), ""conceptivae"" (movable), or ""imperativae"" (appointed for special occasions). When Christianity spread, on the ""feriae"" (feasts) instituted for worship by the Church, the faithful were obliged to attend Mass; such assemblies gradually led, for reasons both of necessity and convenience, to mercantile enterprise and market gatherings which the Germans call Messen, and the English fairs. They were fixed on saints' days (e.g. St Bartholomew Fair in London, St Germanus's fair, St Wenn's fair, etc.). In the Roman Rite liturgy, the term ""feria"" is used to denote days of the week other than Sunday and Saturday. Various reasons are given for this terminology. The sixth lesson for December 31 in the pre-1962 Roman Breviary says that Pope Sylvester I ordered the continuance of the already existing custom ""that the clergy, daily abstaining from earthly cares, would be free to serve God alone"". Others believe that the Church simply Christianized a Jewish practice. The Jews frequently counted the days from their Sabbath, and so we find in the Gospels such expressions as ""una Sabbati"" and ""prima Sabbati"", the first from the Sabbath. The early Christians reckoned the days after Easter in this fashion, but, since all the days of Easter week were holy days, they called Easter Monday, not the first day after Easter, but the second ""feria"" or feast day; and since every Sunday is the ""dies Dominica"", a lesser Easter day, the custom prevailed to call each Monday a ""feria secunda"", and so on for the rest of the week. The only modern language that fully preserves this Latin ecclesiastical style of naming weekdays is Portuguese, which uses the terms ""segunda-feira"", etc. Greek uses very similar terms, but without the Latin-derived ""feira"". See Week-day names#Numerical for an overview of both systems. A day on which no saint is celebrated is called a feria (and the celebration is referred to as ferial, the adjectival form of ""feria""). In the present form of the Roman Rite, certain ferias, especially those of Lent, exclude celebration of memorials occurring on the same day, though the prayer of the memorial may be used in place of that of the feria, except on Ash Wednesday and in Holy Week, which exclude even solemnities and feasts. The Code of Rubrics of Pope John XXIII (1960) divided ferias into four classes: In pre-1960 forms of the Roman Rite, ferias were divided into major and minor. The major ferias, which required at least a commemoration even on the highest feast days, were the ferias of Advent and Lent, the Ember days, and the Monday of Rogation week; all others were called minor.

wikipedia-1280534," The Innocents Abroad  ""The Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims' Progress"" is a travel book by American author Mark Twain published in 1869 which humorously chronicles what Twain called his ""Great Pleasure Excursion"" on board the chartered vessel ""Quaker City"" (formerly ) through Europe and the Holy Land with a group of American travelers in 1867. It was the best selling of Twain's works during his lifetime and one of the best selling travel books of all time. Starter commentary and material. Analysis. ""Innocents Abroad"" presents itself as an ordinary travel book. It is based on an actual event, in a retired Civil War ship (the USS ""Quaker City""). The excursion upon which the book is based was billed as a Holy Land expedition, with numerous stops along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as a train excursion from Marseilles, France to Paris for the 1867 Paris Exhibition, and a side trip through the Black Sea to Odessa, all before the ultimate pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Twain recorded his observations and critiques of various aspects of culture and society he met on the journey, some more serious than others, which gradually turned from witty and comedic to biting and bitter as he drew closer to the Holy Land. Once in the Holy Land proper, his tone shifted again, this time to a combination of light-hearted comedy and a reverence not unlike what he had previously mocked in his traveling companions. Many of Twain's criticisms were based on the contrast between his own experiences and the often grandiose accounts in contemporary travelogues, which were regarded in their own time as indispensable aids for traveling in the region. Above all others, Twain lampooned William Cowper Prime's ""Tent Life in the Holy Land"" for its overly sentimental prose and its often violent encounters with native inhabitants. Twain also made light of his fellow travelers and the natives of the countries and regions he visited, as well as his own expectations and reactions. Themes. A major theme of the book, insofar as a book assembled and revised from the newspaper columns Twain sent back to America as the journey progressed can have a theme, is that of the conflict between history and the modern world; the narrator continually encounters petty profiteering and trivializations of the past as he journeys, as well as the strange emphasis placed on particular events in the past, and is either outraged, puzzled, or bored by the encounter. One example can be found in the sequence during which the boat has stopped at Gibraltar. On shore, the narrator encounters seemingly dozens of people intent on regaling him, and everyone else, with a bland and pointless anecdote concerning how a particular hill nearby acquired its name, heedless of the fact that the anecdote is, indeed, bland, pointless, and toward the end, entirely too repetitive. Another example may be found in the discussion of the story of Abelard and Heloise, where the skeptical American deconstructs the story and comes to the conclusion that too much fuss has been made about the two lovers. Only when the ship reaches areas of the world that do not exploit for profit or bore passers-by with inexplicable interest in their history, such as the passage dealing with the ship's time at the Canary Islands, is this trait not found in the text.  This reaction to those who profit from the past is found, in an equivocal and unsure balance with reverence, in the section of the book that deals with the ship's company's experiences in the Holy Land. The narrator reacts here, not only to the exploitation of the past and the unreasoning (to the American eye of the time) adherence to old ways, but to the profanation of religious history. Many of his illusions are shattered, including his discovery that the nations described in the Old Testament could easily fit inside many American states and territories, and that the kings of those nations might very well have ruled over fewer people than could be found in some small towns.  This equivocal reaction to the religious history the narrator encounters may be magnified by the prejudices of the time, as the United States was still primarily a Protestant nation at that point. The Catholic Church, in particular, receives a considerable amount of attention from the narrator, specifically, its institutionalized nature. This is particularly apparent in the section of the book dealing with Italy, where the poverty of the lay population and the relative affluence of the church causes the narrator to urge—in the text of the book, if not directly—the inhabitants to rob their priests. External links. As a travel book, ""Innocents Abroad"" is accessible through any one of its chapters, many of which were published serially in the United States. (A compilation of the original newspaper accounts was the subject of McKeithan (1958)). In many of the chapters, a uniquely ""Twainian"" sentence or word stands out. A sampling of chapter material appears below and includes links to visual representations as well as to dedicated Mark Twain projects that have included ""Innocents Abroad"" in their sweep: """"We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign -- foreign from top to bottom -- foreign from center to circumference -- foreign inside and outside and all around -- nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness -- nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! in Tangier we have found it."""" "

wikipedia-1280566," Roughing It  Roughing It is a book of semi-autobiographical travel literature written by American humorist Mark Twain. It was written during 1870–71 and published in 1872 as a prequel to his first book ""Innocents Abroad"". This book tells of Twain's adventures prior to his pleasure cruise related in ""Innocents Abroad"". ""Roughing It"" follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the Wild West during the years 1861–1867. After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman (not included in the account), he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the novel. ""Roughing It"" illustrates many of Twain's early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. In this memoir, readers can see examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which would become a staple of his writing in his later books, such as ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"", ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"", and ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"". U.S. astronauts Frank Borman and James Lovell read ""Roughing It"" aloud to pass the time aboard NASA's Gemini VII, a 14-day-long Earth orbital mission in December 1965. Borman recalls reading the book during an on-camera interview in the 1999 PBS-TV (USA) television program ""Nova: To the Moon"". 2002 movie adaptation. Based on Mark Twain's 1872 autobiographical novel, this made-for-cable film is presented in flashback form, as aged humorist Mark Twain (James Garner) is invited as the keynote speaker for the Bryn Mawr College graduation ceremonies of 1891. At first concerned that his reputation as a humorist will embarrass his daughter Susy (Jewel Staite), who is among the graduates, Twain decides to throw all caution to the winds by delivering an inspirational speech in which he recalls his own early days as a Missouri-bred greenhorn on the wild western frontier. Admitting that his recollections may stretch the truth a bit (""When I was younger, I could remember it, whether it happened or not""), Twain spins a tale of two brothers, Sam and Orion Clemens (""Sam Clemens"" was of course, Twain's given name). Jealous over Orion's (Greg Spottiswood) appointment as secretary to the governor of the Nevada Territory, young Sam Clemens (Robin Dunne) insists on tagging along, but soon parts ways when he decides that nascent Carson City does not suit his desire for adventure. In search of fortune and his destiny, what ensues is an extended adventure which includes a rugged interlude digging for gold under the baleful eye of a brutal foreman (Eric Roberts); a wild card game during torrential rains; a bone-chilling winter; bandits and outlaws; along with an episode with Mr. Slade (Ned Beatty), a cruel man that's killed 26 men for petty reasons, and kept their ears as a ""calling card"". The cast also includes Jill Eikenberry as Twain's wife Livy and Adam Arkin as a ""wild-eyed character"" named Henry. Filmed in Calgary, the four-hour miniseries version of Mark Twain's ""Roughing It"" was presented by the Hallmark cable channel beginning March 16, 2002. "
wikipedia-1280581," Hamartia  Hamartia (Ancient Greek: ) is a word most famously used in ""Poetics"", where it is usually translated as a mistake or error in judgment. In modern discussions of tragedy, hamartia has often been described as a hero's ""tragic flaw."" The word hamartia is rooted in the notion of missing the mark (""hamartanein"") and covers a broad spectrum that includes ignorant, mistaken, or accidental wrongdoing, as well as deliberate iniquity, error, or sin.  This form of drawing emotion from the audience is a staple of the Greek tragedies. In Greek tragedy, stories that contain a character with a hamartia often follow a similar blueprint. The hamartia, as stated, is seen as an error in judgment or unwitting mistake is applied to the actions of the hero. For example, the hero might attempt to achieve a certain objective X; by making an error in judgment, however, the hero instead achieves the opposite of X, with disastrous consequences. However, hamartia cannot be sharply defined or have an exact meaning assigned to it. Consequently, a number of alternate interpretations have been associated with it, such as in the New Testament where ""hamartia"" is the Greek word translated ""sin"". Bible translators may reach this conclusion, according to T. C. W. Stinton, because another common interpretation of hamartia can be seen as a “moral deficit” or a “moral error” (Stinton 221). R. D. Dawe disagrees with Stinton’s view when he points out in some cases hamartia can even mean to not sin (Dawe 91). It can be seen in this opposing context if the main character does not carry out an action because it is a sin. This failure to act, in turn, must lead to a poor change in fortune for the main character in order for it to truly be a hamartia.  History of hamartia in Aristotelian interpretation. Aristotle uses the term hamartia in his book ""Poetics"", and through the years the word has been interpreted differently. Many modern scholars have argued that the meaning of the word that was traditionally given in interpreting Aristotle’s book is not really the correct meaning, and that there is another meaning of the word. In the article “Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle,” the scholar J.M. Bremer first explained the general argument of the poetics and, in particular, the immediate context of the term. He then traces the semasiological history of the hamart-group of the words from Homer (who also tried to determine the meaning behind the word) and Aristotle, concluding that of the three possible meanings of hamartia (missing, error, offense), the Stagirite uses the second in our passage of Poetics. It is, then a “tragic error"", i.e., a wrong action committed in ignorance of its nature, effect, etc., which is the starting point of a causally connected train of events ending in disaster. Today the word and its meaning is still up in the air; even so the word is still being used in discussion of many plays today, such as ""Hamlet"" and ""Oedipus Rex"". Major examples of hamartia in literature. Hamartia was often described as a tragic flaw, especially in discussing Greek tragedy. Isabel Hyde discusses the type of hamartia Aristotle meant to define in the ""Modern Language Review"", “Thus it may be said by some writers to be the ‘tragic flaw’ of Oedipus that he was hasty in temper; of Samson that he was sensually uxorious; of Macbeth that he was excessively ambitious; of Othello that he was proud and jealous - and so on… but these things do not constitute the ‘hamartia of those characters in Aristotle’s sense” (Hyde 321). This explains that Aristotle did not describe hamartia as an error of character, but as a moral mistake or ignorant error. Even J. L. Moles comments on the idea that hamartia is considered an error and states, “the modern view (at least until recently) that it means ‘error’, ‘mistake of fact’, that is, an act done in ignorance of some salient circumstances” (Moles 49). Hyde goes on to question the meaning of true hamartia and discovers that it is in fact error in the article, “The Tragic Flaw: Is It a Tragic Error?” She claims that the true hamartia that occurs in Oedipus is considered “his ignorance of his true parentage” that led him to become “unwittingly the slayer of his own father” (Hyde 322). This example can be applied when reading literature in regards to the true definition of hamartia and helps place the character’s actions into the categories of character flaws and simple mistakes all humans commit. Within Oedipus, it is apparent that these errors are the result of hamartia caused by the gods and these tragic actions occur because tragedy has been willed upon the characters. R. D. Dawe brings this use of hamartia in literature to the forefront in the article “Some Reflections on Ate and Hamartia” found in ""Harvard Studies of Classical Philology"". For instance, “this hamartia is in reality as predestined as the incest and parricide and belongs to the category of the ‘forced error’… from the artistic point of view it provides the satisfactory illusion of a voluntary choice” (Dawe 118-119). This forced error is caused by the gods and the hamartia the characters engage in has been predestined since their birth. (In relation to Ate and Hamartia relationship, see also Golden's article)  Another example of hamartia in Greek tragedy is Antigone. Although she has been presented with the decree from her Uncle not to bury her brother and her obsession with her dead family ties initially gets her in trouble, the true hamartia or “error” in this tragedy rests on Creon. It occurs when he orders his men to properly bury Polynices before releasing Antigone which can be identified as the mistake or error that led to her death. Creon’s own ignorance causes the hamartia that results in Antigone’s death and Dawe agrees here, “Creon believed himself to be acting rightly in the interests of the city. Antigone, Haemon, Tiresias, the chorus and Creon himself (post eventum) recognize that he is in fact mistaken” (Dawe 113). Many characters have flaws that influence their decisions to act in a certain way yet they make mistakes, only to realize them later. True Aristotelian hamartia arises when mistakes or errors cause the plot or direction of action to change in a tragic way as described in the tragedies of Antigone and Oedipus. ""Tragic flaw"". While the traditional popular rendering of ""hamartia"" as ""tragic flaw"" (or ""fatal flaw"") is broadly imprecise and often misleading, it cannot be ruled out that the term as Aristotle understood it could sometimes at least partially connote a failure of morals or character:  Whether Aristotle regards the “flaw” as intellectual or moral has been hotly discussed. It may cover both senses. The hero must not deserve his misfortune, but he must cause it by making a fatal mistake, an error of judgement, which may well involve some imperfection of character but not such as to make us regard him as “morally responsible” for the disasters although they are nevertheless the consequences of the flaw in him, and his wrong decision at a crisis is the inevitable outcome of his character (cf. Aristot. Poet. 6.24.). Aeschylus' ""The Persians"" provides a good example of one's character contributing to his ""hamartia"". Xerxes' error would be his decision to invade Greece, as this invasion ends disastrously for him and Persia. Yet this error is inextricably bound up in Xerxes' chief character flaw: his ""hubris"". A morally tinged understanding of ""hamartia"" such as this can and has been applied to the protagonist of virtually every Greek tragedy. For example, Peter Struck comments on ""Oedipus the King"": The complex nature of Oedipus' ""hamartia,"" is also important. The Greek term ""hamartia,"" typically translated as ""tragic flaw,"" actually is closer in meaning to a ""mistake"" or an ""error,"" ""failing,"" rather than an innate flaw. In Aristotle's understanding, all tragic heroes have a ""hamartia."" The character's flaw must result from something that is also a central part of their virtue, which goes somewhat awry, usually due to a lack of knowledge. By defining the notion this way, Aristotle indicates that a truly tragic hero must have a failing that is neither idiosyncratic nor arbitrary, but is somehow more deeply imbedded -- a kind of human failing and human weakness. Oedipus fits this precisely, for his basic flaw is his lack of knowledge about his own identity. Moreover, no amount of foresight or preemptive action could remedy Oedipus' hamartia; unlike other tragic heroes, Oedipus bears no responsibility for his flaw. The audience fears for Oedipus because nothing he does can change the tragedy's outcome. Thus, while the concept of ""hamartia"" as an exclusively moral or personal failing is foreign to Greek tragedy, the connotation is not entirely absent. Nevertheless, to import the notion of Hamartia as ""tragic flaw"" into the act of doing literary analysis locks the critic into a kind of endless blame game, an attitude of superiority, and a process of speculation about what the character could or (worse) should have done differently. Tragedy often works precisely because the protagonist in choosing good, chooses something that will lead to unhappiness. This is certainly the case with Oedipus and, arguably, the case with Hamlet. Criticisms. Concepts from Aristotle's Poetics have been used for centuries to enhance dramatic works. There is, however, no consensus about what constitutes a proper use of hamartia. According to R. D. Dawe, ""In particular hamartia appears inaccurate when measured against the events in Oedipus Rex, a play which is clearly in the forefront of Aristotle's mind throughout the Poetics, and which he mentions by name in the present context"". (Dawe 90) He continues to say readers have a choice ""either hamartia in Aristotle's discussion has a meaning unknown from any of its other very frequent occurrences in Greek Literature (including Aristotle himself) and Aristotle has not seen fit to add a word to of clarification to his casual introduction of this novel concept: or else his words have almost no relevance in Greek as it was actually practiced..."" (Dawe 91). Lastly, Dawe points out that Aristotle spends much less time on hamartia than he does peripetia or anagnorisis; thus it's ""incorrect to speak of hamartia as a doctrine"" (Dawe 90). J. M. Bremer, who published ""Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy"" in the ""American Journal of Philology"", is satisfied with the meaning ""error"" but thinks its wrong to believe ""that there is any notion of fault or moral defect involved in hamartia"" (Bremer 711). He suspects ""that the meaning of hamartia is one of those problems which become the more insoluble the more fully they are examined"" (Bremer 711) and adds that the meaning is very skeptical (Bremer 711). The more research done and the more input added on hamartia, the less a finite definition is found, which is partly why Bremer explains hamartia's problem is ""insoluble"". Dawe and Bremer agree on the fact that the definition of hamartia can and does differ from reader to reader, thus adding significance to Dawe's comment of it not being comparable to Aristotle's more definite terms of peripetia and anagnorisis.

wikipedia-1280596," Tax increment financing  Tax increment financing, or TIF, is a public financing method that is used as a subsidy for redevelopment, infrastructure, and other community-improvement projects in many countries, including the United States. Similar or related value capture strategies are used around the world.  TIF is a method to use future gains in taxes to subsidize current improvements, which are projected to create the conditions for said gains. The completion of a public or private project often results in an increase in the value of surrounding real estate, which generates additional tax revenue. Sales-tax revenue may also increase, and jobs may be added, although these factors and their multipliers usually do not influence the structure of TIF. When an increase in site value and private investment generates an increase in tax revenues, it is the ""tax increment."" Tax Increment Financing dedicates tax increments within a certain defined district to finance the debt that is issued to pay for the project. TIF was designed to channel funding toward improvements in distressed, underdeveloped, or underutilized parts of a jurisdiction where development might otherwise not occur. TIF creates funding for public or private projects by borrowing against the future increase in these property-tax revenues.  Although the TIF method has been discontinued in the state it began in, California, thousands of TIF districts still currently operate nationwide in the US, from small and mid-sized cities, to the State of California which will be paying off debt on old TIFs for years to come. As of 2008, California had over four hundred TIF districts with an aggregate of over $10 billion per year in revenues, over $28 billion of long-term debt, and over $674 billion of assessed land valuation. TIF began in California in 1952, but the state has currently discontinued the use of them due to a couple of lawsuits.  With the exception of Arizona and Wyoming, every state and the District of Columbia has enabled legislation for tax increment financing. Some states, such as Illinois, have used TIF for decades, but others have only recently embraced TIF. Since the 1970s, the following factors have led local governments (cities, townships, etc.) to consider tax increment financing: lobbying by developers, a reduction in federal funding for redevelopment-related activities (including spending increases), restrictions on municipal bonds (which are tax-exempt bonds), the transfer of urban policy to local governments, State-imposed caps on municipal property tax collections, and State-imposed limits on the amounts and types of city expenditures. Considering these factors, many local governments have chosen TIF as a way to strengthen their tax bases, attract private investment, and increase economic activity. Criticism. TIF districts have attracted much criticism. Some question whether TIF districts actually serve their resident populations. An organization called Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform (MORR) holds regular conferences on redevelopment abuse. Here are further claims made by TIF opponents: Examples. Chicago. The city of Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois, has a significant number of TIF districts and has become a prime location for examining the benefits and disadvantages of TIF districts. The city runs 131 districts with tax receipts totaling upwards of $500 million for 2006. Lori Healey, appointed commissioner of the city's Planning and Development department in 2005 was instrumental in the process of approving TIF districts as first deputy commissioner. The Chicago Reader, a Chicago alternative newspaper published weekly, has published articles regarding tax increment financing districts in and around Chicago. Written by staff writer Ben Joravsky, the articles are critical of tax increment financing districts as implemented in Chicago. Cook County Clerk David Orr, in order to bring transparency to Chicago and Cook County tax increment financing districts, began to feature information regarding Chicago area districts on his office's website. The information featured includes City of Chicago TIF revenue by year, maps of Chicago and Cook County suburban municipalities' TIF districts. The Neighborhood Capital Budget Group of Chicago, Illinois, a non-profit organization, advocated for area resident participation in capital programs. The group also researched and analyzed the expansion of Chicago's TIF districts. Though the organization closed on February 1, 2007, their research will be available on their website for six months. Albuquerque. Currently, the largest TIF project in America is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico: the $500 million Mesa del Sol development. Mesa del Sol is controversial in that the proposed development would be built upon a ""green field"" that presently generates little tax revenue and any increase in tax revenue would be diverted into a tax increment financing fund. This ""increment"" thus would leave governmental bodies without funding from the developed area that is necessary for the governmental bodies' operation. Alameda, California. In 2009, SunCal Companies, an Irvine, California based developer, introduced a ballot initiative that embodied a redevelopment plan for the former Naval Air Station Alameda and a financial plan based in part on roughly $200 million worth of tax increment financing to pay for public amenities. SunCal structured the initiative so that the provision of public amenities was contingent on receiving tax increment financing, and on the creation of a community facilities (Mello-Roos) district, which would levy a special (extra) tax on property owners within the development. Since Alameda City Council did not extend the Exclusive Negotiation Agreement with Suncal, this project will not move forward. In California, Community Redevelopment Law governs the use of tax increment financing by public agencies. Applications and administration. Cities use TIF to finance public infrastructure, land acquisition, demolition, utilities and planning costs, and other improvements including sewer expansion and repair, curb and sidewalk work, storm drainage, traffic control, street construction and expansion, street lighting, water supply, landscaping, park improvements, environmental remediation, bridge construction and repair, and parking structures. State enabling legislation gives local governments the authority to designate tax increment financing districts. The district usually lasts 20 years, or enough time to pay back the bonds issued to fund the improvements. While arrangements vary, it is common to have a city government assuming the administrative role, making decisions about how and where the tool is applied.  Most jurisdictions only allow bonds to be floated based upon a portion (usually capped at 50%) of the assumed increase in tax revenues. For example, if a $5,000,000 annual tax increment is expected in a development, which would cover the financing costs of a $50,000,000 bond, only a $25,000,000 bond would be typically allowed. If the project is moderately successful, this would mean that a good portion of the expected annual tax revenues (in this case over $2,000,000) would be dedicated to other public purposes other than paying off the bond.

wikipedia-1280610," Route reflector  A route reflector (RR) is a network routing component. It offers an alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of internal border gateway protocol (IBGP). A RR acts as a focal point for IBGP sessions. The purpose of the RR is concentration. Multiple BGP routers can peer with a central point, the RR - acting as a route reflector server - rather than peer with every other router in a full mesh. All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients. This approach, similar to OSPF's DR/BDR feature, provides large networks with added IBGP scalability. In a fully meshed IBGP network of 10 routers, 90 individual statements (spread throughout all routers in the topology) are needed just to define the remote-AS of each peer: this quickly becomes a headache to administer. A RR topology could cut these 90 statements down to 18, offering a viable solution for the larger networks administered by ISPs. A route reflector is a single point of failure, therefore (at least) a second route reflector should be configured in order to provide redundancy. Rules. RR servers propagate routes inside the AS based on the following rules: "
wikipedia-1280630," M. F. Husain  Maqbool Fida Husain (17 September 1915 – 9 June 2011) commonly known as MF Husain, was an Indian-Qatari painter and Film Director. Husain was associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—usually treated in series—include topics as diverse as Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British raj, and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. One of the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artists of the 20th century, he also received recognition as a printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker. Biography. Husain was born into a Muslim family on 17 September 1915 in Pandharpur, Maharashtra to a Sulaymani Bohra family who trace their roots back to Gujarat within the last 200 years, and then originally to Yemen. Primarily self-taught, Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai early in his career. To earn extra money, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often traveled to Gujarat to paint landscapes when he could afford to. 1940–1965. Husain first became well known as an artist in the late 1940s. He was one of the original members of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group founded by Francis Newton Souza. This was a clique of young artists who wished to break with the nationalist traditions established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. His first U.S.A. exhibit was at India House in New York in 1982. In 1952, his first solo exhibition was held at Zürich and over the next few years, his work was widely seen in Europe and the US. In 1966, he was awarded the prestigious Padma Shri award by the Government of India. 1966–1990. In 1967, he made his first film, ""Through the Eyes of a Painter"". It was shown at the Berlin Film Festival and won a Golden Bear(Short Film). M. F. Husain was a special invitee along with Pablo Picasso at the Sao Paulo Biennial (Brazil) in 1971. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1973 and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1986. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1991. 1990–2005. Indifferent to both religion and politics, Husain, a Muslim by upbringing, treated the gods and goddesses of Hinduism as visual stimuli rather than deities, depicting them unclothed and often in sexually suggestive poses. This earned him the bitter hatred of Hindu nationalist groups, which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of intimidation and violence against him. The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in ""Vichar Mimansa"", a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined ""M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher"". In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, Delhi High Court dismissed these complaints of ""promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindus."" In 1998 Husain's house was attacked by Hindu groups like Bajrang Dal and art works were vandalised. The leadership of Shiv Sena endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police. Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in London, England. He has also produced & directed several movies, including ""Gaja Gamini"" (2000) (with his muse Madhuri Dixit who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed ""Fida""). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself. In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of Kalidasa, the Mona Lisa, a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film ""Mohabbat"", which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain's. He went on to make """" (with Tabu). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it. The All-India Ulema Council complained that the Qawwali song ""Noor-un-Ala-Noor"" was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by Tabu. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards. 2006-2011. In February 2006, Husain was charged with ""hurting sentiments of people"" because of his nude portraits of Hindu gods and goddesses. In addition, in the 6 February 2006 issue, ""India Today"", a national English weekly published an advertisement titled ""Art For Mission Kashmir"". This advertisement contains a painting of Bharatmata (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by Nafisa Ali of Action India (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organizations like Hindu Jagruti Samiti and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) have protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologized and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, which was later sold for Rs 80 lakh in the auction. The painting later appeared on Husain's official website. Husain became the best-paid painter in India, with his highest-selling piece fetching $1.6 million at a 2008 Christie's auction. Hundreds of lawsuits in connection with Husain's allegedly obscene art were outstanding as of 2007. A warrant was issued for his arrest after he did not appear at a hearing, though this warrant was later suspended. Husain also received death threats. Husain lived in self-imposed exile from 2006 until his death. He generally lived in Doha and summered in London. In 2010, he was conferred Qatari nationality, and he surrendered his Indian passport. In Qatar, he principally worked on two large projects, one on the history of Arab civilization, commissioned by Qatar's first lady, Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, and one on the history of Indian civilization. The works are to be housed in a museum in Doha. For the last years of his life Husain lived in Doha and London, staying away from India, but expressing a strong desire to return, despite fears of being killed. At the age of 92 Husain was to be given the prestigious Raja Ravi Varma award by the government of Kerala. The announcement led to controversy in Kerala and some cultural organisations campaigned against the granting of the award and petitioned the Kerala courts. Sabarimala spokesperson, Rahul Easwar, went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of. In 2010, the Jordanian Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre named Husain as one of the 500 most influential Muslims. M. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery on 10 June 2011. India's Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh said his death was a ""national loss"", and India's former President Pratibha Patil said his death ""left a void in the world of art."" The actress Shabana Azmi called him an ""iconoclastic painter, a wonderful human being and a very good friend"". Talking about his self-imposed exile and death outside of India painter Akbar Padamsee said that it was a ""pity that a painter as important as Husain had to die outside his own country because of a crowd of miscreants"". Supporters and critics. The artistic community was supportive as well as critical. Krishan Khanna, one of Husain's contemporaries, stated that ""It's not just Husain's but the entire artist community's lives which are at stake. Anybody and everybody can file a case against us now. Anyone can infringe upon our lives"". Others who expressed anger at the ""vicious campaigns"" against Husain, include filmmaker Saeed Mirza, social activist Nafisa Ali, theatre personality M. K. Raina and a host of other artistes, art critics and art gallery owners. Salil Tripathi, writing in the ""International Herald Tribune,"" notes that Hindu goddesses have regularly been portrayed in the nude by Hindu artists. Tripathi wrote, ""It is hypocritical to place curbs on Husain's artistic freedom. What's more shameful is that a government that claims to be the secular alternative to Hindu nationalists is threatening to prosecute Husain. This does not do India proud; it adds to India's disgrace."" Other Indian artists expressed criticism. Satish Gujral publicly asked Husain whether would dare to Islamic figures similarly. However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed ""the mob culture"". According to a senior Hindu artist and former President, Bombay Art Society, Gopal Adivrekar, ""Nothing is bad in being creative but the artists should not go for such artwork, which may hurt the sentiments of a segment of the society."" Writing in ""The Pioneer"", Chandan Mitra wrote, ""As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Hussain's objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court."" In response to the controversy, Husain's admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the Bharat Ratna, India's highest award. According to Shashi Tharoor, who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his ""life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country."" On his part Husain stated that Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice. Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said, ""He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!"" "

Classic LRS employment is to infiltrate deep into enemy territory, construct hide and surveillance sites, and provide continuous surveillance/special reconnaissance of an intelligence target of key interest. LRS teams allow 24-hour surveillance and analysis coverage unlike Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), manned aircraft, and most satellites. Assuming there is no mission compromise, these teams typically remain in position for up to 30 days, as determined by the availability of food and water. Today's LRS units trace their origin to the US Army's Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol units LRRPs of Western Europe and the Vietnam War, and to Army Rangers. Mission. LRSUs operate up to from the Forward Line Of Troops (FLOT) for a maximum of 30 days. Their five primary missions are reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, battle damage assessment, and force protection. They also have many secondary missions capabilities to include enemy prisoner-snatch, emergency assaults, general battlefield information (weather and light data, map data, etc.). LRS team operations are characterized by the following: Organization. LRS units (LRSU) are Infantry company-size elements that are assets within a Battlefield Surveillance Brigade's Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S Squadron) designated as US Army Cavalry but are functionally Airborne Infantry units. The LRSU is structured as an LRS troop (a ""troop"" is the Cavalry equivalent of an infantry company) comprising three LRS platoons, a communications Platoon, and a Troop Headquarters. Within the LRS troop the LRS platoons typically have designated specialties. For example, one platoon will specialize in Long Range Surveillance missions, another will specialize in Pathfinder missions and a third will specialize in sniper and target acquisition missions. (This informal arrangement is established by the commander of each LRS troop and varies from unit to unit.) LRS platoons are organized as five unsupported LRS teams. LRS Team composition. Each US Army LRS team is composed of six soldiers: Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron. LRS units are being transferred into the United States Army's new Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB) organizations. These brigades contain a Brigade Headquarters & Headquarters Company (HHC), two Military Intelligence Battalions, and a Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S). The Reconnaissance & Surveillance squadrons conduct the same reconnaissance missions as a RSTA but the R&S capabilities are vastly broader and encompass all aspects of basic reconnaissance. Additionally, LRS units have the added capability of conducting strategic level Long Range Surveillance missions deep behind enemy lines. Due to this specialized capability of strategic Long Range Surveillance, the LRS units' R&S capability is significantly more comprehensive than RSTAs. The US Army RSTA units' missions may require them to make and maintain contact with the enemy, forfeiting their ability to avoid detection. The only units within the US Army to specialize in the capability and skill of the Long Range Surveillance mission are those of the Long Range Surveillance units within the US Army's Battlefield Surveillance Brigades, Special Forces Operation Detachment Alphas (ODA) (also known as Special Forces A Teams that reside within the US Army's Special Forces Groups) and the Regimental Reconnaissance Company of the US Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. The BfSB's R&S squadron is composed one Long Range Surveillance unit (Troop C) with 15 LRS teams that conducts both tactical reconnaissance and strategic Long Range Surveillance missions. The R&S also has two Cavalry Troops (two platoons each) that conduct basic mounted and dismounted tactical reconnaissance and a Headquarters & Headquarters Troop (HHT).  The primary method of insertion behind enemy lines (for a 6-man LRS team) is by night helicopter or secondarily, by an Airborne Operation. In recent low-intensity conflicts, additional covert means have been added. Airborne reconnaissance missions are conducted by the previously mentioned three types of units in the Army: Long Range Surveillance (LRS) units, the Regimental Recon Company (formerly the Regimental Recon Detachment) of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and various Special Forces A-Teams. Contrast with Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition units. LRS units (Airborne Infantry) are not to be confused with the new Army concept of Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) units (a non-Airborne capable Cavalry unit). As part of the Army-wide transfer to Brigade Combat Teams, all combat divisions and separate brigades are transitioning to the RSTA format. RSTA units also have added light vehicle support in the form of Humvees and M3 Bradleys, due to being commissioned as cavalry. LRS units in contrast do not utilize a larger vehicle support element. RSTA units are not airborne capable, whereas all LRS units are (exceptions being the RSTA squadron of the 4th BCT (Abn), 25th Infantry Division; the 173rd Airborne BCT; and the four in the 82nd Airborne Division). By doctrine, RSTA units do not require their leadership positions to be filled by Ranger qualified officers and NCOs, as LRS units do in addition to many more specialized skill qualifications. Equipment. LRS team members usually carry the M4 carbine, M203 grenade launcher, M9 pistol, and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) as well as the typical complement of specialized optics and communications gear. Training. LRSUs are Airborne Forces and most leadership positions are filled by Ranger qualified officers and NCOs. LRS leaders typically undergo the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC) at Fort Benning, where they learn long range land navigation, communications, intelligence, vehicle identification, survival, and operational techniques. LRS troopers are often graduates of other specialized schools including:  US Army LRS-Us conduct training exercises and exchange programs with various US allies. In recent years these exercises have included deployments to England, Germany, France, Hungary, and Italy. Joint training exercises have involved units from British TA SAS, France's 13e RDP, Belgium's ESR, Italy's 9th Parachute Assault Regiment and Germany's FSLK200. "
wikipedia-1280667," Raised pavement marker  A raised pavement marker is a safety device used on roads. These devices are usually made with plastic, ceramic, or occasionally metal, and come in a variety of shapes and colors. Raised reflective markers include a lens or sheeting that enhances their visibility by reflecting automotive headlights. Some other names for specific types of raised pavement markers include Botts' dots, delineators, cat's eyes, road studs, or road turtles. Sometimes they are simply referred to as reflectors. Reflective raised pavement markers. In the United States, Canada, as well as Australia, these plastic devices commonly have two angled edges facing drivers and containing one or more corner reflector strips. In areas where snowplowing is frequent, conventional markers are placed in a shallow groove cut in the pavement, or specially designed markers are used which include a protective metal casting that is embedded in recesses in the pavement, allowing the marker to protrude slightly above the pavement surface for increased visibility, much like a cat's eye. In areas with little snowfall, reflective raised pavement markers are applied directly to the road surface rather than being embedded into the surface. The device's reflective surface enables the device to be clearly visible at long distances at night and in rainy weather. The devices come in multiple colors which vary in usage depending on local traffic marking standards. Usage of color in Europe. In almost all European countries, such markers will include reflective lenses of some kind. Most appear white or gray during daylight; the colors discussed here are the color of light they reflect. Because of their inconspicuousness during the day, they are always used in conjunction with painted retro-reflective lines, they are never seen on their own. The exception to the above rules are: Usage of color in North America. Colors can also be combined, with a different color facing each direction: The current trend for lane markings is to intersperse retroreflective paint lines with reflectors as seen on the majority of American highways. Usage of color in Australia. While Australian designs generally follow those in the U.S., the colors generally follow European usage. Differences from European usage include: History. Cat's eyes were the earliest form of reflective pavement markers, and are in use in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They were invented in the United Kingdom in 1933 by Percy Shaw and patented in 1934 (UK patents 436,290 and 457,536), and the United States in 1939 (U.S. patent 2,146,359). On March 15, 1935, Shaw founded Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd, which became the first manufacturer of raised pavement markers. The designs now used widely throughout the United States didn't appear until more than a decade later. They are based on the invention of engineer Sidney A. Heenan in the course of his employment with the Stimsonite Corporation in Niles, Illinois. Heenan filed an application for a patent on October 23, 1964. Patent No. 3,332,327 was subsequently granted on July 25, 1967. Practical use of Heenan's invention was not realized until an abrasion and impact resistant coating was invented by engineer Ramon J. Ascencio of the Stimsonite Corporation, working with the original team. Ascencio et al., filed an application for patent April 20, 1977 which was subsequently granted under Patent No. 4,596,622 on June 24, 1986. Stimsonite went on to become the leading manufacturer of raised pavement markers in the United States and was acquired in the mid-1990s by Avery Dennison Corporation. For about a decade, Avery sold Stimsonite's line under its Sun Country brand. In 2006, Avery sold its raised pavement marker division to Ennis Paint, one of the largest manufacturers worldwide of paint for pavement markings (particularly lane markings). The company (based in Ennis, Texas) changed its name to Ennis Traffic Safety Solutions and now markets the Stimsonite product line (and descendants) under the Stimsonite brand. Other manufacturers of reflective raised pavement markers sold in the United States under various designs include 3M, Apex Universal, and Ray-O-Lite. Cat's eyes. Cat's eyes, in their original form, consist of two pairs of reflective glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a cast iron housing. They are generally more durable than Botts' dots (they are snowplough safe) or other forms of markers and also come in a variety of colors. They have enjoyed widespread usage in the British Isles and elsewhere around the world. Botts' dots. Nonreflective raised pavement markers (also known as Botts' dots) are usually round, are white or yellow, and are frequently used on highways and interstates in lieu of painted lines. They are glued to the road surface with an epoxy and as such are not suitable in areas where snow plowing is conducted. They are usually made out of plastic or ceramic materials. Pedestrian crossing studs. In the UK, the area in which pedestrians should cross at pelican crossings is marked out by a series of markers. Occasionally these are painted as squares on the road but more often a metal stud is used. These are usually square and made from unpainted steel or aluminum. Delineator. Delineators are tall pylons (similar to traffic cones or bollards) mounted on the road surface, or along the edge of a road, and are used to channelize traffic. These are a form of raised pavement marker but unlike most such markers, delineators are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, delineators are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle's tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more reflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45 degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a ""T"" shape. They can also be used to indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced.  The name delineator is also used for reflective devices attached to other objects which are technically not pavement markers. "
wikipedia-1265795," Toyo Ito  In 2013, Ito was awarded the Pritzker Prize, one of architecture's most prestigious prizes. He was a likely front-runner for the Pritzker Prize for the previous 10 years. A recent trend has seen less experienced and well-known winners, for example Chinese architect Wang Shu in 2012, and the award to Toyo Ito is seen as recognition of a lifetime's achievement in architecture.  Early life and education. Ito was born in Seoul, Korea under Japanese rule to Japanese parents on 1 June 1941. In 1943, he moved to Japan with his mother and  two sisters, and graduated from the University of Tokyo's department of architecture in 1965. Career. After working for Kiyonori Kikutake Architect and Associates from 1965 to 1969 (alongside Itsuko Hasegawa), in 1971 he started his own studio in Tokyo, named Urbot (""Urban Robot""). In 1979, the studio name was changed to Toyo Ito & Associates.  Throughout his early career Ito constructed numerous private house projects that expressed aspects of urban life in Japan. His most remarkable early conceptual contributions were made through projects of this scale, such as ""White U"" (1976) and ""Silver Hut"" (1984).  With the ""Pao for the Tokyo Nomad Girl"" projects in 1985 and 1989, Ito presented a vision of the life of an urban nomad, illustrative of typical lifestyles during the bubble economy period in Japan. ""Tower of Winds"" (1986) and ""Egg of Winds"" (1991) are interactive landmarks in public spaces, resulting from a creative interpretation of contemporary technical possibilities. Whilst their function is in fact exhaust air outlets for the underground system below, their significance lies in Ito's treatment of their opacity, one of the hallmarks of his work. Whilst appearing solid during the day, the perforated aluminium structures ""dissolve"" at night through the use of computer-controlled light systems which form an interactive display representing measured data such as noise levels in their surrounding vicinity. Toyo Ito's office is known as a training ground for talented younger architects. Architects who previously worked for his office include Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA), Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham (KDa), Katsuya Fukushima, Makoto Yokomizo, and Akihisa Hirata. Critical vision. Ito's work is often said to have affinities with the ideas of philosophers such as Munesuke Mita and Gilles Deleuze.  Ito has defined architecture as ""clothing"" for urban dwellers, particularly in the contemporary Japanese metropolis. This theme revolves around the equilibrium between the private life and the metropolitan, ""public"" life of an individual.  The current architecture of Toyo Ito expands on his work produced during the postmodern period, aggressively exploring the potentials of new forms. In doing so, he seeks to find new spatial conditions that manifest the philosophy of borderless beings. Exhibitions. Ito's work has been exhibited widely. In 1991, Ito used 130 video projectors to simulate the urban environment of Tokyo for the ""Visions of Japan"" exhibition at The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Later, in 2000, his ""Vision and Reality"" at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art also became a traveling exhibition. Ito similarly exploited the effect of video projection as a medium with which to exhibit architecture in his ""Blurring Architecture"" exhibition, initiated at the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen and traveling to four other cities (Tokyo, Antwerp, Auckland, and Wellington between 1999 and 2001). Ito designed the ""Berlin-Tokyo/Tokyo-Berlin"" Exhibition (2006) at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The design featured a smooth, undulating landscape that occupied almost the entirety of the museum's main exhibition space. This exhibition, in collaboration with the Mori Art Museum, was one of the largest undertakings in the museum's history. A major retrospective of Ito's work was shown at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery in 2006 as ""Toyo Ito: The New ""Real"" in Architecture."" List of works. Source: Honors and recognition. Ito's awards and honors include: Professorship. Ito holds a professorship at the Japan Women's University. He is also an honorary professor at the University of North London and has served as guest professor at Columbia University. He teaches at Tama Art University as a Visiting Professor. "
wikipedia-1265819," American Megatrends  American Megatrends Incorporated (AMI) is an American hardware and software company that specializes in PC hardware and firmware. The company was founded in 1985 by Pat Sarma and S. Shankar, who was chairman and president . It is headquartered in Building 200 at 5555 Oakbrook Parkway in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States, near the city of Norcross. The company started as a manufacturer of complete motherboards, positioning itself in the high-end segment. Its first customer was PCs Ltd, later known as Dell Computers. As hardware business moved progressively to Taiwan-based original design manufacturers, AMI continued to be a BIOS firmware developer for major motherboard manufacturers. The company produced BIOS software for motherboards, server motherboards (1992), storage controllers (1995) and remote management cards (1998). In 1996 AMI produced MegaRAID, a storage controller card which was adopted by major OEMs including HP and Dell. The RAID division assets were sold to LSI Logic in 2001. Products. AMIBIOS. AMIBIOS (also AMI BIOS) is the BIOS developed and sold by American Megatrends. It is used on motherboards made by AMI and by other companies. American Megatrends has a strict OEM business model for AMIBIOS: it sells source code to motherboard manufacturers or customizes AMIBIOS for each OEM individually, whichever business model they require. AMI does not sell to end users, and itself produces no end-user documentation or technical support for its BIOS firmware, leaving that to licensees. However, the company published two books on its BIOS in 1993 and 1994, (listed in further reading), written by its engineers. During powerup, the BIOS firmware displays an ID string in the lower-left-hand corner of the screen. This ID string comprises various pieces of information about the firmware, including when it was compiled, what configuration options were selected, the OEM license code, and the targeted chipset and motherboard. There are 3 ID string formats, the first for older AMIBIOS, and the second and third for the newer AMI Hi-Flex (""high flexibility"") BIOS. These latter are displayed when the Insert key is pressed during power-on self-test. The original AMI BIOS did not encrypt the machine startup password, which it stored in non-volatile RAM. Therefore, any utility capable of reading a PC's NVRAM was able to read and to alter the password. The AMI WinBIOS encrypts the stored password, using a simple substitution cipher.  By pressing the Delete key during power-on self-test when a prompt is displayed, the BIOS setup utility program is invoked. Some earlier AMIBIOS versions also included a cut-down version of the AMIDIAG utility that AMI also sold separately, but most later AMI BIOSes do not include this program as the BIOS DMI already incorporates detailed diagnostics. AMIBIOS is only sold through distributors, not directly to end users. Firmware upgrades and replacements are only available from AMI for its own motherboards. Upgrades and replacements for AMIBIOS customized for a motherboard are only available from the manufacturer or from eSupport. AMI supplies both DOS and Win32 firmware upgrade utilities for its own motherboards. eSupport only supplies a Win32 upgrade utility. AMIDiag. AMIDiag is a family of PC diagnostic utilities sold to OEMs only. The AMIDiag Suite was introduced in 1988 and made available for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) platforms. It includes both the Windows and DOS PC diagnostics programs. Later versions of AMIDiag support UEFI, which allows diagnostics to be performed directly on the hardware components, without having to use operating system drivers or facilities. Service processor and IPMI. The MegaRAC remote management controller was introduced in 1998 for Dell, that later developed the DRAC. The second generation card, MegaRACG2, provided console and KVM redirection, firewall and battery backup, but was rather expensive. Successive MegaRAC generations, the G3 and G4, provide incremental performance at lower prices. In the early twentyfirst century the server industry was largely migrating to IPMI technology. AMI launched the MegaRAC PM Firmware Solution in 2002, with code completely independent of AMIBIOS. With the development of powerful chip-based integrated baseboard management controllers, the focus of AMI shifted to providing firmware-based service processor solutions. Called MegaRAC SP, the firmware implements complete KVM redirection, console redirection and remote media for System-on-Chip. An SoC subsystem complete with MegaRAC SP has a definite cost advantage over card-based alternatives. StorTrends/ManageTrends. The StorTrends family of network-based backup and storage management software and hardware includes several NAS and iSCSI-based SAN servers with 4, 12, or 16 drive bays. AMI couples off-the-shelf hardware with the StorTrends iTX storage management firmware platform. StorTrends offers synchronous, asynchronous and snap-assisted replication, thin-provisioning, high-availability grouping and advanced caching. Reliability and performance is the key for any storage server. StorTrends iTX 2.8 is designed to support Storage Bridge Bay specification that provide Auto-Failover capability to ensure that any interruption is handled without affecting data. It supports High-availability cluster, redundancy, scalability, replication, disaster recovery and multiple site backups. Technical problems. On November 13, 1993, a number of PCs that used the AMIBIOS firmware started at boot-up to play the tune to Happy Birthday repeatedly while halting the computer until a key was pressed. The problem was resolved with a Trojan-free firmware upgrade from most manufacturers.  The AMI WinBIOS was a 1994 update to AMIBIOS, with a graphical user interface setup screen that mimicked the appearance of Windows 3.1 and supported mouse navigation, unusual at the time. WinBIOS was viewed favourably by Anand Lal Shimpi at AnandTech, but described by Thomas Pabst at Tom's Hardware as a ""big disappointment"", in part because of problems with distributing IRQ signals to every PCI and ISA expansion slot. In July 2008 Linux developers discovered issues with ACPI tables on certain AMIBIOS BIOSes supplied by Foxconn, ASUS, and MSI. The problem is related to the ACPI _OSI method, which is used by ACPI to determine the OS version (in case an ACPI patch only applies to one specific OS). In some cases, the OSI method caused problems on Linux systems, skipping code that was only executed on Windows systems. Foxconn and AMI worked together to develop a solution, which was included in later revisions of AMIBIOS. The issue affected motherboards with Intel Socket 775. Actual system behavior differed based on BIOS version, system hardware and Linux distribution. Founding. American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) was founded in 1985 by Subramonian Shankar and Pat Sarma with funds from a previous consulting venture, Access Methods Inc. (also AMI). Access Methods was a company run by Pat Sarma and his partner. After Access Methods successfully launched the AMIBIOS, there were legal issues among the owners of the company, resulting in Sarma buying out his partners. Access Methods still owned the rights to the AMIBIOS. Sarma had already started a company called Quintessential Consultants Inc. (QCI), and later set up an equal partnership with Shankar.  By this time the AMIBIOS had become established and there was a need to keep the initials AMI. The partners renamed QCI as American Megatrends Inc., with the same initials as Access Methods Inc.; the renamed company then purchased AMIBIOS from Access Methods. Shankar became the president and Sarma the executive vice-president of this company. This partnership continued until 2001, when LSI Logic purchased the RAID Division of American Megatrends; American Megatrends then purchased all shares of the company owned by Sarma, making Shankar the majority owner.

wikipedia-1265835," Hajji  Hajji (, , ""al-ḥajjī"" or الحاج ""al-ḥājj"", , , , , , , , ""pilgrim""; sometimes spelled Hadji or Haji) or El-Hajj, is an honorific title given to a Muslim person who has successfully completed the Hajj to Mecca, and is often used to refer to an elder, since it can take time to accumulate the wealth to fund the travel. The title is placed before a person's name (for instance, Saif Gani becomes Hajji Saif Gani). It is derived from the Arabic ""al-Ḥājj"", which is the active participle of the verb ""ḥajja"" 'to make the pilgrimage to Mecca'. The alternative form ""ḥajjī"" is derived from the name of the Hajj with the adjectival suffix -""ī"", and this was the form adopted by non-Arabic languages. In some areas, the title has been handed down the generations, and has become a family name. Such usage can be seen, for example, in the Bosniak surname ""Hadžiosmanović"", which means 'son of Hajji Osman'. Women who complete the Hajj are referred to as Hajjah or الحاجة ""al-Ḥājjah""., or (in Hausa/Fulani) Hajiya. In Arab countries, ""Ḥājj"" and ""Ḥājjah"" (pronunciation varying based on the form of Arabic spoken) is a common respectful manner of addressing any older person, regardless of whether or not the person in question has actually performed the pilgrimage. The term is also used in the Balkan Christian countries that were once under Ottoman domination (Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Macedonia and Romania) for a Christian who had traveled to Jerusalem and the Holy Lands. In Cyprus, where for centuries Christians and Muslims intermixed freely and Jerusalem is conveniently local, the title became so prevalent as to be permanently integrated into some Greek Christian family names, such as Hajiioannou, regardless of any lack of qualification. Racial Slur. ""Hajji"", ""Haji"" or ""Hodgie"" is more recently used as a derogatory term by American military personnel as a comprehensive term for Iraqis, Arabs, Afghans, or Middle Eastern and South Asian people in general. It is comparable to the term ""gook,"" used by U.S military personnel during the Vietnam War. "

According to the Shafi'is and Hanbalis, this is the only surah to have two prostations of recitation, however the Hanafis and Malikis do not recognise the second apparent sajda. Ayat 73 states: ""You, the living humanity; an example has made the equation evident, therefore you people be attentive to listen. It is a fact that those, whom you people call, apart from Allah, will never ever be able to create housefly even if they all rallied together/made a collective effort for that purpose. to say of creating housefly Moreover, if a housefly takes/snatches away something from their front they all cannot recover that thing from that housefly. The seeker and the sought are thus proved feeble."" [22:73] It is not in the example that the man cannot catch or kill a housefly. The impossibility quoted is that of creating housefly and taking/recovering back what he has snatched/taken and moved away. Today we can catch and see the housefly in thousands of larger than original size and could see the particle taken by him and could recover it. However, Grand Qur'an informs us that we will never be able to recover it from housefly. A housefly keeps exposing our frailty the world over. The housefly has a soft proboscis, a trunk as organ that branches into a two-lobed tip and has a spongy pad called a labellum. A specific feature of the housefly is the way it ""digests"" food. Unlike many other living organisms, a fly ""digests"" food not through its mouth, but outside of its body. The spongy pad (labellum) dribbles saliva onto the thing they want to take away. It contains enzymes that breaks down the thing they want to take away and dissolves/liquefies it. As soon, it happens the proboscis comes into play on the wet surface and the fluid’s suction is by means of capillary action and a bellows-like pump in the head. It sucks up our thing from our front, stows away the pad and moves on. We will never be able to outwit the housefly and get back our ""property"" he has snatched. Does not this proven frailty of ours and of those whom we keep calling suggest us to submit and be exclusively allegiant and sincere to the Creator of the Housefly and wholeheartedly accept His words permanently written in the Grand Qur'an? Certainly, this Qur'an is undoubtedly the one, which is absolutely convincing statement of proven truth/absolute fact.

wikipedia-1265850," Surigaonon language  Surigaonon is a Philippine language spoken by Surigaonon people in the province of Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Sur, and some portions of Agusan del Norte especially the towns near the Mainit Lake, Agusan del Sur and Davao Oriental. Though it seems related to Cebuano it was due mainly to the influx of many Cebuanos in the region and some Cebuano words were loaned, although most Cebuano speakers can hardly understand Surigaonon speakers except for Cebuanos who has been living in the region for years. It is very closely related to the Tausug language of Sulu (specially the root Tausug language without the Arabic words influence) and the dying Butuanon dialect of Butuan. The very close variety spoken in Tandag city, San Miguel, Tago, Bayabas, Cagwait, Marihatag, San Agustin and most part of Lianga is called Tandaganon and it can be classified as a separate language or simply just a southern variation of Surigaonon at which most of the speakers lives in the south (Surigao del Sur) and Surigaonon itself is the northern (Surigao del Norte) variation which has far more speakers than Tandaganon to which they occupies all of the municipalities of Surigao del Norte and the northern municipalities of Surigao del Sur. Surigaonon and Tandaganon can understandand each other perfectly well even if they use their own languages when talking to each other (The same treatment to Boholano dialect of Cebuano). Surigaonon or/and Tandaganon is spoken in Surigao del Norte and most part of Surigao del Sur (except in the City of Bislig, Municipalities of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig and Tagbina wherein most of the inhabitants are descendants of Cebuanos who migrated from Visayas who speak Cebuano and the rest are natives who speak Kamayo a different language but distantly related to Surigaonon). It has similar consonant and vowel sounds and stress and intonation patterns as the Cebuano and Boholano languages. Surigaonon underwent certain morphophonemic processes, such as assimilation, deletion, alternation and metathesis (Dumanig, 2005). In the study conducted by Dumanig (2005), ""Descriptive Analysis of Surigaonon language"" it was found that there are 18 consonants (b, d, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, t, w, y, o, ?) with 18 sounds and 3 vowels (a,i,u) with 5 sounds. It has also 25 consonant clusters (br, bl, bw, by, dr, dy, dw, gr, gw, kr, kl, kw, mw, my, nw, pr, pl, pw, py, sw, sy, tr, tw, ty, hw) and 4 diphthongs (aw, ay, iw, uy), which is similar to Cebuano (Rubrico, 1999). There are Surigaonon words that are spelled similarly but they differ in meaning depending on how each syllable is stressed (Dumanig, 2005). Surigaonon follows two intonation patterns - rising and falling intonation. Rising intonation is common in asking yes-no questions and falling intonation occurs when ending declarative and imperative statements (Dumanig, 2005).

The film, a British-American co-production made between the Monty Python production company Prominent Features, Channel Four Films and Miramax Films, is about the troubles faced by a colliery brass band, following the closure of their pit. The soundtrack for the film was provided by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and the plot is based on Grimethorpe's own struggles against pit closures. It is generally very positively received for its role in promoting brass bands and their music. Parts of the film make reference to the huge increase in suicides that resulted from the end of the coal industry in Britain, and the struggle to retain hope in the circumstances. Channel 4 and ""The Guardian"" both sponsored what was expected to be a low-profile film; it was not expected to gain the wide audience that it has. Having expected viewers to be mostly those with past links to coal mining, the film does not make explicit the political background to the plot. The American marketing for the film (and later VHS and DVD releases) portrays the film as a cheerful romantic comedy with nearly no mention at all about the musical or political elements. The film stars Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor. The film was well received as a comedy, and by some as a political statement about the state of traditional coal mining communities in Britain. The film was particularly well received in former mining communities, who felt it accurately reflected the suffering they faced because of the decline of their industry during the years of the Thatcher and Major Conservative governments. It is set during the latter period, when Michael Heseltine presided over a huge programme of pit closures, as President of the Board of Trade. Audio samples from the film were used on the 1997 Chumbawamba record, ""Tubthumper"". Background. The film is set in ""Grimley"" in the mid-1990s — a thinly disguised version of the real South Yorkshire village of Grimethorpe, which had been named as the poorest village in Britain two years earlier by the European Union. The nearby areas of the Dearne Valley and the Hemsworth area were also identified as in need of serious aid. Indeed, the soundtrack for the film was recorded by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, the story roughly reflects Grimethorpe Colliery Band's history, and the film was largely shot in Grimethorpe. The Grimley Colliery Band in the film is made up of a mixture of actors and members of the Grimethorpe Band. The miners in the film put up little resistance to the coal board's harsh redundancy policy. This can be understood in the context of the 1984-85 British miners' strike, which effectively destroyed trade union power in British coal mining industry. The film depicts the spirit of hopelessness 10 years after the strike, and the miners' attempts to find redemption. An ongoing piece of symbolism in the first half of the film is the lack of conversation between one miner and his wife, until she finally criticises him harshly for not making a show of resistance against the closure, when he had been so full of fight in 1984. Plot. Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) has been sent to her old hometown of Grimley to determine the profitability of the pit for the management of British Coal. She also plays the flugelhorn brilliantly, and is allowed to play with the local brass band, made up of miners from whom she must conceal her purpose. She renews a childhood romance with Andy (Ewan McGregor), which soon leads to complications. It is later revealed during a confrontation between Gloria and the management of the colliery that the decision to close the colliery had been made two years previously, and that this was to have gone ahead regardless of the findings of her report; the report simply being a P.R. exercise to placate the miners and members of the public sympathetic to their plight.  The passionate band conductor, Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), finds he is fighting a losing battle to keep the rest of the band members committed. His son Phil (Stephen Tompkinson) is badly in debt and becomes a clown for children's parties, but fails to prevent his wife and children walking out on him. As Danny, (who is earlier seen coughing coal dust into a handkerchief) collapses in the street and is hospitalised from pneumoconiosis or a similar disease, Phil, who is later revealed to be struggling with the guilt of having voted to take a lump sum rather than fight the closure of the colliery, has a breakdown while entertaining a group of children as part of a harvest festival in a church. Saying he doesn't know much about harvest festival, he offers to tell a story about God, which descends into a foul-mouthed satire about how the Tory Party was created (having been informed there was a surplus of bodies but no brains, hearts and vocal cords, God gave instructions to ""Sew 'em up anyway. Smack smiles on their faces and make them talk out their arses."") then, after being asked to leave, and being told ""May God forgive you."" gestures towards the effigy of Jesus on the cross and reels off a list of perceived injustices, asking ""What the bloody hell's He playing at?"" before parting with ""You've been great. My name's Coco the Scab."" Later (in one of the film's darker moments) he attempts suicide by trying to hang himself from the girders of one of the colliery's winding towers. He is spotted, still in his clown costume, by two security guards who, it is assumed, save him. Danny, lying in a hospital bed, notices Phil's clown shoes as he is pushed by the door to his ward on a trolley. While talking in the hospital, Phil reveals to Danny that in light of the colliery's closure, the band has decided not to continue playing. With the intention that it will be their last performance, the band, (in full uniform, and wearing their miner's helmets and cap lamps) play ""Danny Boy"" late at night outside the hospital. Andy, having pawned his tenor horn, whistles along with his hands in his pockets. After they finish, they all switch off their lamps. As the colliery itself is finally closed, the band finds success in the national brass band competition. Andy wins his tenor horn back in a game of pool, and having forgiven Gloria, after she gives them the money she was paid to compile the report, (saying she doesn't want it because it's ""dirty money"") the band travel to the final at the Royal Albert Hall in London, (Birmingham Town Hall was used to film these scenes) where they are amused by the woman on the P.A. system in the dressing room's inability to pronounce colliery, with an older band member remarking ""I bet she's glad the bugger's closed."" Before departing, Phil leaves a note for Danny, which is found on the bed by a nurse along with Danny's pajamas the next morning. The note simply says: ""WE'RE GOING!"" Danny arrives, in uniform, just in time to see the band win the competition with a stirring rendition of ""The William Tell Overture"", during which Phil notices his wife and children are in the audience. Danny refuses to accept the trophy stating that it's only human beings that matter and not music or the trophy and that ""...this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry— our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of 'progress'. And for a few lousy bob"". However, despite this moving gesture, another band member takes away the giant cup with a typical Yorkshire ""Don't talk so bloody daft"". The film ends with Andy and Gloria kissing passionately on the upper deck of an open topped bus travelling through London, while the rest of the band play Land of Hope and Glory conducted by Danny. Soundtrack. The soundtrack for ""Brassed Off"" is officially composed by Trevor Jones although some titles existed before Jones' commission as original compositions for brass band or arrangements for example Death or Glory and Floral Dance respectively. Trivia. A a sample of a monologue performed by main character Danny (played by Pete Postlethwaite) is used in the opening of the song Tubthumping on the 1997 Chumbawamba album Tubthumper: ""Truth is, I thought it mattered; I thought that music mattered. But does it bollocks! Not compared to how people matter."" "

wikipedia-1265870," South African Rugby Union  The South African Rugby Union (SARU) is the governing body for rugby union in South Africa and is affiliated to the International Rugby Board. It organises several national teams, most notably the senior national side, the Springboks. History. Today's SARU, originally called the South African Rugby Football Union, was established on the 23 March 1992 following the unification of the former whites-only South African Rugby Board (SARB) and the non-racial South African Rugby Union signed at the Kimberley Sun Hotel. Kimberley was chosen as the venue for it had been the founding city of the South Africa Rugby Football Board in 1889 and the South Africa Coloured Rugby Board in 1896. The new body's headquarters were at Newlands. All committees were shared. The first presidents were Danie Craven (executive) and Ebrahim Patel. The new non-racial body meant readmission into international rugby after eight years of isolation due to apartheid.  SARU has 14 Provincial Unions as members – the Blue Bulls Rugby Union (Pretoria), Boland (Wellington), Border (East London), Eastern Province (Port Elizabeth), Falcons (Springs), Free State (Bloemfontein), Golden Lions (Gauteng), Griffons (Welkom), Griqualand West (Kimberley), Leopards (Potchefstroom), Mpumalanga (Witbank), Natal (Durban), South Western Districts (George) and Western Province (Cape Town).  Unification was the first revolution for SARFU, whilst the second was the swift onset of professionalism in the wake of the Rugby World Cup in 1995. Enhanced commercialism and the need to run rugby as a business has provided the third and latest revolution. In order to meet this challenge, SARFU, in August 2001, established a business arm – SA Rugby (Pty) Ltd – to manage all of its commercial activities locally and internationally.  SA Rugby (Pty) Ltd manages all aspects relating to national teams, brand building and protection, merchandising, sponsors and suppliers, media rights, marketing, tours and tournaments, financial services and medical services. Early in 2005, the union adopted its current name. Current events. SARU is now attempting to recover from the tumultuous tenure of former president Brian van Rooyen. His tenure as SARU (then SARFU) president began in 2004, after the debacle of the 2003 World Cup, which saw the Springboks exit in the quarterfinals, and the scandal of Kamp Staaldraad, the training camp run by then-Boks coach Rudolph Straeuli. Straeuli would resign, as did Rian Oberholzer, the managing director of South Africa Rugby (Pty) Ltd, the commercial arm of SARFU. Soon afterwards, SARFU president Silas Nkununu, facing a strong reelection challenge, withdrew from consideration for election, and van Rooyen was elected president. He soon became a highly polarising figure in South African sport, with detractors accusing him of financial shenanigans, favouritism, and general mismanagement. His management style was also widely perceived as autocratic. One of the major gripes against the van Rooyen administration was the allocation of Springboks Test matches. The KwaZulu-Natal union did not receive a Tri Nations Test in either 2005 or 2006; the Free State union received no Tests in either year. Both unions, vocal opponents of van Rooyen, accused him of punishing them for their opposition. However, the biggest bone of contention surrounded the expansion of the Super Rugby competition. SANZAR, a consortium of the South African, Australian, and New Zealand governing bodies, expanded their Super 12 competition to 14 teams, a change that took effect in 2006. South Africa was entitled to add one franchise to the four from the Super 12 era. In a controversial move, the Southern Spears franchise was assured a place in the 2007 and 2008 competitions, with an increasingly unpopular promotion/relegation system established to keep the total of South African Super 14 teams at its allotted five. Van Rooyen was widely viewed as being responsible for this arrangement, which was generally opposed by the existing Super 12/14 sides. The South African government attempted to step in to address perceived problems within van Rooyen's administration, but he survived two years of attempts to oust him. Finally, at the 2006 SARU General Meeting, van Rooyen was voted out in favour of Oregan Hoskins, who immediately promised a more decentralised management style. Shortly after the election, it was alleged that van Rooyen had offered a bribe of ZAR 3 million (USD 485,000) plus a Springboks Test against France to the Free State union in exchange for the union changing its vote in the presidential election in his favour. Hoskins soon announced that a planned investigation into van Rooyen's administration would go forward. As for the Spears issue, the SARU Presidents' Council issued a recommendation on 24 March that SA Rugby revisit the decision to admit the Spears. On 19 April, the decision to admit the Spears was officially overturned. "

wikipedia-1265911," Sibuyan Island  Sibuyan is a crescent-shaped island of Romblon Province, Philippines. Located in the namesake Sibuyan Sea, it has an area of . The island has two prominent peaks, Mount Guiting-Guiting with a height of and Mount Nailog with a height of . The people speak the Sibuyanon dialect of Romblomanon, a Visayan language. Sibuyan has been dubbed by some local and international natural scientists as ""the Galapagos of Asia"", because it has remained in isolation from the rest of the world since its formation. Never in its geological history has it ever been connected with any part of the Philippine archipelago. Seismic forces pushed up a peak from the earth’s crust, forming a series of smaller peaks and slopes. The peak is Mt. Guiting-Guiting (literally means ""the saw-toothed mountain"", in reference to its jagged ridge). Because of the steep slopes, much of its original forest remains untouched, and the rest is the island as we find it today. Primary forests cover , which is 33% of the land area of Sibuyan. However, most of the lower altitude forest has been logged or is secondary. Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park (equivalent to the IUCN category of National Park) was established to protect these forests, which are mainly in the centre and north of the island, and covers an area of out of Sibuyan’s total area of . The park is remarkable for its outstandingly scenic landscape with twin towering peaks set amidst closed canopy forests. Its forests remain largely intact, and include the entire elevational gradient from lowland dipterocarp forest (at 200 to 900 m) and mangroves, through montane forest (above 700 m) to mossy forest, heathland and montane grassland around the peaks. On June 21, 2008, the ferry MV Princess of the Stars shipwrecked off the coast of San Fernando, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. Biodiversity. Sibuyan has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna which are threatened by an emerging aggressive promotion of mining industry by the country's government. Exact figures on numbers of total plant species are hard to give, as biologists stumble upon species yet unidentified by the scientific community. In one study, the National Museum identified 1,551 trees in a single hectare, with 123 species of trees, and of this number, 54 are found nowhere else in the world. Hence, it has been proclaimed as one of the world’s most diverse and dense forests. There are estimated to be 700 vascular plant species on the island. ""Nepenthes sibuyanensis"", a pitcher plant species, is also endemic as its scientific name suggests. There are 131 species of birds and ten species of fruit bats, and many dwelling mammals, reptiles, and rodents yet to be fully catalogued. Three subspecies are endemic to Sibuyan: ""Colasisi Loriculus philippensis bournsi"", the Philippine Pygmy-woodpecker ""Dendrocopos maculatus menagei"", and the Orange-bellied Flowerpecker ""Dicaeum trigonostigma sibuyanicum"", all of which were recorded there in the early 1990s. Five species of threatened mammals, one fruit bat and four rodents, are endemic to Sibuyan, and the critically endangered fruit bat ""Nyctimene rabori"" occurs there. Local Environmentalists. Notable environment advocates born in Sibuyan Island are climate activist Rodne Galicha, Gawad Geny Lopez Bayaning Pilipino Awardee Dr. Arthur Rey Tansiongco, and martyred councilor Armin Rios Marin. Current environmental issue. The Sibuyanons Against Mining advocacy group, with the Sibuyan Island Sentinels League for Environment Inc. (Sibuyan ISLE), has been fighting for the conservation and protection of the island against mining activities considering its vast impact on the ecology, culture and society of the island. "
wikipedia-1265923," Alternative literature  Alternative Literature (often stylized as Alt Lit or Alt-Lit) is a fairly new form of literature, centered on and/or drawing from the internet, internet culture and ""a population of people that are connected with one another through their interest in the online publishing world"" and also real life, sometimes. It includes various forms of prose and poetry. Beginnings of Alt Lit. The term Alt Lit has no single definition but is often used to refer to a social media-based creative community, loosely unified in their likes and dislikes. It is perhaps easiest to define Alt Lit as the harnessing of the possibilities the internet offers for the creation and publication of literature, and the surrounding community and culture. Certain traits have popularly characterized alt lit: self-publication and advertisement (primarily by social media), homegrown publishing houses, and the maintenance of an internet presence spanning several social networks. Others include the knowledge and referencing of popular figures associated with the community, abuse of ""kiddy drugs"" (notably Adderall, Xanax, and cannabis), and participation in gatherings and readings broadcast on online mediums (primarily Spreecast). The sharing of Gmail chat logs, memes, macros, screenshots, and computer-generated art are also popular. Buddhist and Taoist themes are prevalent in much alternative literature. The term seems to have been first used on a Tumblr/Twitter account named ""Alt Lit Gossip"" (twitter.com/litgossip). After the original accounts were deleted they were revived by Frank Hinton, at which point they began to pick up popularity. Alt Lit authors have generated controversy among traditional writers and readers. New Modernism. Due to its temporal proximity, Alt Lit is often grouped with post-modernism and many other literary movements. Author Phillipe Chatelain argues in his New Modernist Manifesto: New Sincerity. Some critics have linked Alt Lit with the concept of the New Sincerity, to the point of using the terms interchangeably. Notable Alt Lit writers such as Steve Roggenbuck and Tao Lin have also been grouped under the label ""New Sincerity"", but many alt lit writers reject the influence of David Foster Wallace and prominent mainstream exponents of a ""New Sincerity"" such as Jonathan Franzen. The New Sincerity connection entails the use of an array of literary techniques intended to create the impression of ""sincere"" communication, ranging from autobiography, self-revision and conversational tone to minimal punctuation and sans-serif fonts. Authors & Works. Central figures include authors Scott McClanahan, Tao Lin, Noah Cicero, Zachary German, Ben Brooks, Steve Roggenbuck, and reviewer/author Beach Sloth "

wikipedia-1265938," Beautiful Losers  Beautiful Losers is a novel by Canadian writer Leonard Cohen. Published in 1966, it was Cohen's second and final novel, and precedes his career as a singer-songwriter. Set in the Canadian province of Quebec, the story of 17th-century Mohawk saint Kateri Tekakwitha is interwoven with a love triangle between an unnamed anglophone Canadian folklorist; his Native wife, Edith, who has committed suicide; and his best friend, the mystical F, a Member of Parliament and a leader in the Quebec separatist movement. The complex novel makes use of a vast range of literary techniques, and a wealth of allusion, imagery, and symbolism. It is filled with the mysticism, radicalism, sexuality, and drug-taking emblematic of the 1960s era, and is noted for its linguistic, technical, and sexual excesses. Cohen wrote the novel in two eight-month spurts while living on the Greek island of Hydra in 1964 and 1965. He fasted and consumed amphetamines to focus his creativity on the novel. Despite a lavish rollout, sales were disappointing, and critics were initially unsympathetic or hostile. The book gained critical and commercial attention only after Cohen had given up novel-writing and turned to the songwriting and performing upon which his fame rests today. ""Beautiful Losers"" has come to be seen as having introduced postmodernism into Canadian literature. It has become a steady seller, and is considered a part of the Canadian literary canon. Overview. The novel reflects the zeitgeist of the 1960s. While its prose is simple, the book itself is difficult, and dense in imagery and symbolism. It is broken into three books, each with a different narrator: the historian (called ""I."" by critics) is the narrator of book one, ""The History of Them All"", which is the longest book; ""A Long Letter from F."" makes up the second book, a letter from F. to the narrator of the first book; and the third book is narrated by an unnamed third person, and is called ""Beautiful Losers: An Epilogue in the Third Person"". Synopsis. At the centre of the novel are the members of a love triangle, united by their obsessions and fascination with a seventeenth-century Mohawk, Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha. The triangle is made up of the unnamed narrator, an authority on the vanishing A———— tribe; his wife Edith, one of the last surviving members of the tribe; and their maniacal and domineering friend, ""F."", who may or may not exist. Book one opens with an unnamed anglophone Canadian narrator asking ""Who are you, Catherine Tekakwitha?"" The narrator's wife hides in an elevator shaft, intending to have her husband kill her when she comes home. Her plan misfires somewhat, however—it is a delivery boy, instead, who fatally takes the elevator. The narrator and F. console each other in bed over Edith's death. The narrator and F. attend a demonstration in Montreal's ""Parc Lafontaine Park"", where I. gets so caught up in the nationalistic Québécois that he joins in himself, shouting, ""Fuck the English!"" The narrator flees to the treehouse F. has left him in his will. Book two consists of a letter composed by F., intended to be read five years after his death by the narrator of book one. As such, chronologically it takes place before book one. F. escapes the asylum he is in and makes for the treehouse he will leave for the narrator of the first book. F. is cared for in an insane asylum by nurse Mary Voolnd, of the A———— as was Edith. The letter is written in the occupational therapy room of the hospital. Book three opens with a figure in a treehouse, with burnt fingers like the first book's narrator, but also missing a thumb, as F. did after blowing up the statue of Queen Victoria. He is being hunted down as an escaped inmate and terrorist. He is given a ride by a blond woman wearing moccasins, who calls herself Isis, in Greek. Themes. Sex plays a major role in the novel, though the sex scenes tend to be oral or masturbatory. Homosexuality and bisexuality are prominent. Natives are seen as being displaced by the French, while the English displace the French, and are themselves oppressed by the Americans. The English and French in Canada are seen as both oppressors and oppressed, which ties F. and I. together. According to F., the Québécois are able to come together under their feeling of oppression by the anglophones, but anglophone Canada is unable to bring together a national identity to distinguish themselves from the Americans. I. and F. were both raised in a Jesuit orphanage in Montreal. Melancholic I. identifies with victims and losers, such as the ""A————"" tribe, whose very name is said to mean ""corpse in the language of all the neighboring tribes"". while F. tries to ignore or overcome his ""loser""-ness. He asserts himself by throwing himself into the Charles Axis bodybuilding course advertised in a comic book (a parody of the Charles Atlas advertisements well-known to contemporary comic-book readers). He asserts his culture by becoming a leader in the Quebec separatist movement. Background. Cohen had published a number of books of poetry since the 1956 appearance of ""Let Us Compare Mythologies"", and one novel, ""The Favourite Game"" (1963). He had been living on the Greek island of Hydra in the early to mid-1960s, and had composed ""The Favourite Game"" and a book of poetry, ""Flowers for Hitler"", there. On Hydra, English was spoken, and there was an artists' colony there. Cohen wanted to write a ""liturgy, a big confessional oration, very crazy, but using all the techniques of the modern novel ... pornographic suspense, humor and conventional plotting"". Cohen wrote most of the novel during two concentrated eight-month periods in 1964 and 1965. He wrote using a typewriter in a house in Hydra while listening to a portable record player, on which he listened to his favourite Ray Charles record, ""The Genius Sings the Blues"". At first he managed only three pages a day, and sometimes wrote only one hour a day. When the novel began to take shape, he worked up to fifteen hours a day, with the help of amphetamines. He later claimed that amphetamine use was a mistake ""for depressed people"", as coming down was particularly hard. He said it took ""ten years to fully recover"". The first period of writing was interrupted when Cohen returned to Canada in October 1964 to receive the ""Prix litteraire du Québec"" for ""The Favourite Game"", followed by a reading tour. One result of the tour was the film ""Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen"", released in 1965 from the National Film Board of Canada. The tour embittered Cohen, though, as he complained about money and the lack of exposure for his first novel. He found himself torn on the issue of Quebec separation that had arisen as the Quiet Revolution heated up. Montreal's francophone community was asserting itself against the anglophone elite. The Front de Libération du Québec had begun targeting anglophones with bombs in 1963, and a statue of Queen Victoria on Sherbrooke Street was destroyed with a bomb on 12 July. This political turmoil found its way into Cohen's work when he returned to Hydra. Cohen practised fasting during the composition of the novel, believing that it helped focus his creativity and spirituality. Following its completion, Cohen broke down, collapsing from sunstroke and amphetamine consumption. He had hallucinations, and had withered to 116 pounds after going without food for ten days. Cohen published another book of poetry, ""Parasites of Heaven"", in 1966, but by then it became clear to Cohen that he would be unable to make a living as a writer. He shifted focus to music, particularly after becoming interested in Bob Dylan in 1966. That year, he decided to devote himself seriously to a singing career. It was his music for which he later became well known. Publication history. In March 1965, Cohen told Jack McClelland, president of Canadian publishing house McClelland and Stewart, that he would finish the novel in a month. He stated that it would be a success if it escaped the censors, and asked for a cash advance, as he was in need of money. When he completed it three weeks later, he declared that he had ""written the ""Bhagavad Gita"" of 1965"". He claimed he had figured out how to ""write a novel in three weeks"", and that he would manage four more in 1965. Cohen pondered a number of titles for the book. On two different drafts were the titles ""BEAUTIFUL LOSERS / A Pop Novel"" and ""PLASTIC BIRCHBARK / A Treatment of the World"", and notes and letters show him listing many other possible titles. Viking put the difficult book through eight readings before deciding to publish it. Cohen responded to the book's acceptance with a parodic six-page letter anticipating the response of offended Canadian critics. As a condition of the book's publication, Cohen insisted on having control over the cover and jacket copy, so as to avoid the disappointment he had had with the publication of ""Flowers for Hitler"". Further, he insisted on no quotations from critics on the jacket. Publication was somewhat complicated when Cohen lost a carbon copy of the original mauscript to the wind. He was able to continue with revisions after having his New York agent send him another carbon copy. The pre-publication orders of 3 100 copies were more than expected. Before publication, a number of film producers were eying the book, such as Otto Preminger, Ulu Grosbard, Alexander Cohen and the MCA Group. McClelland realized that censorship would be a problem in Canada, and tried to soften the blow with advance publicity via advance copies. The responses from the readers of the advance copies were too negative for him to use, however. A gala lunch was thrown a month in advance of the book's release, and about four hundred of the top names in the Canadian arts world appeared there. Posters had Cohen in a turtleneck and jacket in the hopes that such a sober pose would offset the anticipated scandal. The University of Toronto, which had started collecting Cohen's papers starting in 1964, paid Cohen $6 000 for the original manuscript. The first printing was printed by Viking and bound by McClelland & Stewart. It included typographical extras not included in future editions, such as comic book captions, a Charles Axis advertisement, a radio transcript of Gavin and the Goddesses, and a Greek-English phrase book.  Distribution was restricted, with Simpson's and W. H. Smith refusing to carry the book, despite McClelland's reassurances to W. H. Smith that ""most of the people interested in pornography would not begin to understand either Cohen's purpose or his accomplishment"". The $6.50 cover price dampened sales as well. Cohen thought it too high, but McClelland explained it was necessary to offset the publication costs and extensive promotion. He accused Cohen of being ""unwilling to put self out"" in the way of promotion, and urged him to do more television and radio interviews. Sources and influences. Cohen made use of a number of texts when researching and writing ""Beautiful Losers"": He also read Emanuel Swedenborg extensively: the first two volumes of ""Arcana Cœlestia"", ""Divine Providence"" and ""Divine Love and Wisdom"". He would meet with other writers at the Hydra colony to discuss works such as the ""Book of Revelation"", the ""I Ching"", ""The Secret of the Golden Flower"" and ""The Tibetan Book of the Dead"". Cohen brought works by Martin Buber and Gershom Sholem to these meetings. Style. ""Beautiful Losers"" plot does not unravel in a linear, coherent fashion. Key scenes repeat themselves, and there is no timeline the reader can follow. Reception. Initial sales were poor. It sold better in the US than in Canada, but did not see significant sales until after Cohen achieved success as a singer-songwriter. The novel attracted the attention of critics, and was met with much controversy. Critic Robert Fulford called ""Beautiful Losers"" ""the most revolting book ever written in Canada"", while also stating it was ""an important failure. At the same time it is probably the most interesting Canadian book of the year"". He reported a few days later that a Toronto bookstore had not managed to sell any of the twenty-five copies it stocked eight days after publication. Critics were less shocked by the breaking of taboos than the general public was. Instead, they objected to the novel's complexity of allusion and representation, and the demands it put on the reader due to its incoherence and indeterminacy. It would take another generation of postmodern Canadian literature before ""Beautiful Losers"" would breach the canon. In 1966, the CBC called ""Beautiful Losers"" ""one of the most radical and extraordinary works of fiction ever published in Canada"", and quoted a critic from the Boston Globe who positively compared the work with the fiction of James Joyce. However, they also quoted from the previously mentioned negative review from the critic Robert Fulford. In 1967, Desmond Pacey called ""Beautiful Losers"" ""the most intricate, erudite and fascinating Canadian novel ever written"". In his 1970 monograph on Cohen, Michael Ondaatje called it ""the most vivid, fascinating and brave modern novel"" he had read. ""Beautiful Losers"" had been translated into eleven languages by 1990, and the sales of both of Cohen's novels have surpassed a million copies; ""Beautiful Losers"" had topped three million in sales by 2007. Legacy. ""Beatiful Losers"" has entered the canon of Canadian literature, and has been given much credit for having introduced postmodern literature to Canadian fiction. "
wikipedia-1265998," Clifford Olson  Clifford Robert Olson, Jr. (January 1, 1940 – September 30, 2011) was a convicted Canadian serial killer who confessed to murdering 11 young people between the ages of 9 and 18 years in the early 1980s. Murders. Christine Weller, 12, from Surrey, British Columbia was abducted on November 17, 1980. Her body was found more than a month later on Christmas Day; she had been strangled with a belt and stabbed repeatedly. On April 16, 1981, Colleen Marian Daignault, 13, vanished. It was five months before her body was found. On April 22, 1981, Daryn Todd Johnsrude, 16, was abducted and killed; his body was found less than two weeks later. On May 19, 1981, 16-year-old Sandra Wolfsteiner was murdered, and 13-year-old Ada Anita Court was murdered in June 1981. Six victims followed in quick succession in July 1981. Simon Partington, 9, was abducted, raped and strangled on the second day of the month. Judy Kozma, a 14-year old from New Westminster, was raped and strangled a week later. Her body was discovered on July 25 near Weaver Lake. The next victims were Raymond King Jr., 15, abducted on July 23, raped and bludgeoned to death; Sigrun Arnd, an 18-year old German tourist, raped and bludgeoned two days later; Terri Lyn Carson, 15, raped and strangled on July 27; and Louise Chartrand, age 17, the last victim identified, who died on July 30. Arrest and plea bargain. Olson, who had an extensive criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981 on suspicion of attempts to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson had been charged with the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP where the bodies of those not recovered were buried. In return, authorities agreed that $10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife, Joan, and then-infant son, Clifford III. His wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a 'freebie'. In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given 11 concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada's super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country's most dangerous criminals. Olson was a dangerous offender, meaning it was very unlikely he would ever have been released from prison. Parole application. In 1997, Olson was denied parole, for which he applied under Canada's ""faint hope clause"", which allowed a parole hearing for convicts who had served at least 15 years. Canadian law allows inmates convicted of first-degree murder to apply for parole after serving a minimum of 25 years. Olson's second parole hearing, on July 18, 2006, was also denied. Olson made many bizarre and false claims, including that the United States had granted him clemency for providing information about the September 11 attacks and that the hearing had no jurisdiction over him because of that. Under Canadian law, Olson was then entitled to make a case for parole every two years. Olson was once again refused parole in November 2010. Old Age Security pension controversy. Controversy developed in March 2010 when it was disclosed that Olson was receiving two federal government benefits from Canada while imprisoned, a total of $1,169.47 monthly. Olson was eligible to receive the Canadian Old Age Security (OAS) pension. All persons who meet residency requirements as to length of time in Canada are eligible to receive this pension at age 65, and Olson turned 70 on January 1, 2010. Olson was also eligible to receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), awarded to pensioners with low income. The money in question was being held in trust for Olson.  The Canadian Taxpayers Federation testified before the federal standing committee for Human Resources Development to have MPs pass Bill C-31, which would terminate pension benefits for prisoners. The organization also presented the government with 46,000 petition signatures requesting that Olson no longer receive the benefits. Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked government officials to look into the issue; on June 1, 2010, the government moved to terminate Olson's payments, calling the fact that he had been receiving them ""outrageous"" and ""offensive."" In September 2010, Olson sent one of his Old Age Security cheques to a Sun Media reporter, Peter Worthington, with a note asking him to forward the cheque to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's campaign for re-election. Illness and death. In September 2011, media reports indicated that Olson had terminal cancer and had been transferred to a hospital in Laval, Quebec. He died on September 30, 2011 at the age of 71. "

The Black Oil extracts itself from Krycek, leaving him locked indefinitely in the silo with the ship.  Krycek is next found during an FBI raid, and taken into custody by Mulder and Scully. They learn that Krycek was recruited by an extremist militia group on a salvage hunt from the silo in North Dakota, and he informs the agents they must track the source of an extraterrestrial rock, brought to America by a foreign diplomat, to a gulag in Russia. The hunt leads Krycek and Mulder to Tunguska, where they are held captive until Krycek maneuvers his own release. Mulder attempts his own escape, taking an unconscious Krycek with him. When he awakes, Krycek separates into the woods only to encounter a strange group of Russians - all of whom have missing left arms. The men amputate Krycek's arm as well, to keep him from being used in Black Oil experiments. Eventually, Krycek graduates into a more powerful role within this group. He uses any knowledge he has to gain leverage with the Syndicate. He even has had romantic ties to their secretary, Marita Covarrubias (who apparently was using Krycek for her own means in assisting Mulder). Due to this double-crossing, Krycek is temporarily held captive by the Well Manicured Man. Krycek later appears to Mulder as a friendly messenger to tell him that a war has begun, and that Mulder must ""resist or serve"". Later in the series, Krycek can be seen switching sides as it suits him, occasionally helping Mulder, Cigarette Smoking Man and other people. He attempted to blackmail Skinner with infectious nanotechnology, but ended up being thrown into a Tunisian prison by the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the season seven finale, ""Requiem"", Krycek tries and fails to kill the now wheelchair-bound Cigarette Smoking Man by pushing him down a flight of stairs. Later, when Mulder was abducted by aliens and returned in a death-like state, Krycek attempts to again blackmail Skinner, with the means to save Mulder's life. Skinner refuses, and Krycek has a violent confrontation with John Doggett before escaping. In the season eight finale, ""Existence"", Krycek is shot between the eyes and killed by Skinner, during an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mulder. Krycek's ghost briefly showed up to help Mulder escape a military base in the series finale. Conceptual history. Originally, the role of Krycek was offered to Callum Keith Rennie, who rejected it, but later made two guest appearances on the show. Krycek does not appear in the first season, but Nicholas Lea did have a small part in the Monster-of-the-Week episode, ""Gender Bender"". In the episode, he played a club goer named ""Michael"". When Lea appeared as Krycek, the producers felt that they could kill him off if the portraying actor didn't do a good enough job. Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes, eventually grew into a character that lasted eight seasons on the show. Reception. Nicholas Lea would also appear as Krycek on the sketch show ""Saturday Night Live"", when David Duchovny hosted an episode. Duchovny and Lea appeared in their roles as Mulder and Krycek, respectively in a sketch that spoofed ""The X-Files"". "
wikipedia-1266008," Terrane  A terrane in geology is a shorthand term for a tectonostratigraphic terrane, which is a fragment of crustal material formed on, or broken off from, one tectonic plate and accreted or ""sutured"" to crust lying on another plate. The crustal block or fragment preserves its own distinctive geologic history, which is different from that of the surrounding areas – hence the term ""exotic"" terrane. The suture zone between a terrane and the crust it attaches to is usually identifiable as a fault. Older usage of ""terrane"" simply described a series of related rock formations or an area having a preponderance of a particular rock or rock groups. Overview. A tectonostratigraphic terrane is not necessarily an independent microplate in origin, since it may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere. It is a piece of crust which has been transported laterally, usually as part of a larger plate, and is relatively buoyant due to thickness or low density. When the plate of which it was a part subducted under another plate, the terrane failed to subduct, detached from its transporting plate, and accreted onto the overriding plate. Therefore, the terrane transferred from one plate to the other. Typically, accreting terranes are portions of continental crust which have rifted off another continental mass and been transported surrounded by oceanic crust, or old island arcs formed at some distant subduction zone.  A tectonostratigraphic terrane is a fault-bounded package of rocks of at least regional extent characterized by a geologic history which differs from that of neighboring terranes. The basic characteristics of these terranes is that the present spatial relations are not compatible with the inferred geologic histories. Where juxtaposed terranes processes coeval strata, it must be demonstrable that the geologic evolutions are different and incompatible, and there must be an absence of intermediate lithofacies which could link the strata The concept of ""tectonostratigraphic terrane "" developed from studies in the 1970s of the complicated Pacific Cordilleran (""backbone"") orogenic margin of North America, a complex and diverse geological potpourri that was difficult to explain until the new science of plate tectonics illuminated the ability of crustal fragments to ""drift"" thousands of miles from their origin and fetch up, crumpled, against an exotic shore. Such terranes were dubbed ""accreted terranes"" by geologists.  When terranes are composed of repeated accretionary events, and hence are composed of subunits with distinct history and structure, they may be called superterranes. "
wikipedia-1266010," Fore River Shipyard  The Fore River Shipyard of Quincy, Massachusetts, more formally known as the Fore River Ship and Engine Building Company, was a shipyard in the United States from 1883 until 1986. Located on the Weymouth Fore River, the yard began operations in 1883 in Braintree, Massachusetts before being moved downstream to its permanent location in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1901. The shipyard helped build early U.S. submarines and many ships commissioned by the United States Navy, including the World War II battleship and aircraft carriers and . In the 1960s, the yard was purchased by General Dynamics. It continued to produce ships for the navy until being converted to LNG tanker production before finally closing in 1986. The yard built the ""Thomas W. Lawson"", the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and , one of two foreign battleships built in the United States. It was home to the ""Goliath"" crane, for a time the second-largest shipbuilding crane in the world. It is also the likely origin of the World War II ""Kilroy was here"" graffiti character. History. Early history and war years. Started by Thomas A. Watson in 1883, the shipyard was located on the Weymouth Fore River near East Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1901, the yard was moved to Quincy in the eastern part of the Quincy Point neighborhood. By the time that the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, the company was operated under the direction of former Admiral Francis T. Bowles, who had become the company's president in a late 1903 reorganization, displacing Thomas Watson, who assumed the title Chairman of the Board. Watson, who was pleased with how Bowles ran the yard, stepped aside in 1904. In 1913, Bethlehem Steel purchased the yard. It built many renowned warships and Liberty ships during World War II. John J. Kilroy, the apparent originator of the famous ""Kilroy was here"" graffiti, was a welding inspector at Fore River during the war years. General Dynamics years. Fore River changed hands again in 1964, when it was purchased by General Dynamics Corporation. The shipyard became General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, and General Dynamics invested $23 million to improve the shipyard to make it more competitive. The yard constructed several ships for the U.S. Navy, including nuclear-powered submarines, ammunition ships, replenishment oilers, and dock landing ships. The shipyard converted to building LNG tankers during its final years. Despite a last minute attempt at an employee buyout, the shipyard closed for good in 1986. Although shipbuilding operations ceased at that time, the name of the yard continues to be used, and the location is still referred to as Fore River Shipyard. Post-closing years. In 1994, —the last all-gun heavy cruiser ever built—returned to the Quincy yard, becoming the centerpiece of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum. Following several abortive attempts to restart the shipyard as a shipbuilding center, Daniel J Quirk, a local auto dealer, bought the property in 2004 for use as a motor vehicle storage and distribution facility, but it still serves also as a port for commuter boats to Boston and Hull run by Harbor Express for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The yard is also used by Jay Cashman, Inc., for heavy construction and marine equipment services, by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as a sewage sludge heat-drying and pelletizing facility, and by Fore River Transportation Corporation for short line freight rail service to CSXT South Braintree. Goliath crane. On August 14, 2008, ironworker Robert Harvey was killed when a portion of the Goliath crane collapsed during dismantlement. Work on the crane's removal was halted for two months while local and federal officials investigated the accident, but the work later resumed and was completed in early 2009. As a result of their investigation, on January 13, 2009 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed fines totalling $68,000. A barge carrying the crane was christened the USS ""Harvey"" in honor of the fallen worker and left the shipyard on March 7, 2009 en route to Romania.  The August 2008 fatal incident was preceded by two other deaths involving demolition of the main gantry at the shipyard on January 26, 2005. The earlier incident resulted in an OSHA ruling against Testa Corporation of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, including a proposed $60,400 fine. Following the 2005 collapse, violations involving improper cleanup and removal of asbestos found in debris left by the accident resulted in a $75,000 penalty imposed against Testa by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.

wikipedia-1266078," Aeta people  The Aeta (Ayta, pronounced ), or Agta, are an indigenous people who live in scattered, isolated mountainous parts of Luzon, Philippines. They are considered to be Negritos, who are dark to very dark brown-skinned and tend to have features such as a small stature, small frame, curly to kinky afro-like textured hair with a higher frequency of naturally lighter hair color (blondism) relative to the general population, small nose, and dark brown eyes. They are thought to be among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, preceding the Austronesian migrations.  The Aeta were included in the group of people termed ""Negrito"" during Spanish colonial rule as Negritos. Various Aeta groups in northern Luzon are known as ""Pugut"" or ""Pugot,"" a name designated by their Ilocano-speaking neighbors, and which is the colloquial term for those with darker complexions. In Ilocano, the word also means ""goblin"" or ""forest spirit."" However, these terms are considered by fellow Negritos of northern Luzon as inappropriate and offensive. History. The Aeta people in the Philippines are Australo-Melanesians. Today other groups of Australo-Melanesians are the Aborigines in Australia, Papuans and the Melanesians of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia etc.  The history of the Aeta continues to confound anthropologists and archaeologists. One theory suggests that the Aeta are the descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, who, contrary to their seafaring Austronesian neighbors, arrived through land bridges that linked the country with the Asian mainland about 30,000 years ago. Unlike many of their Austronesian counterparts, the Aetas have shown resistance to change. The attempts of the Spaniards to settle them in ""reducciones"" or reservations all throughout Spanish rule failed. The Aeta are an indigenous people who live in scattered, isolated mountainous parts of the Philippines. Aetas are considered as the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, preceding the Austronesian migrations. They are nomadic and build only temporary shelters made of sticks driven to the ground and covered with the palm of banana leaves. The well-situated and more modernized Aetas have moved to villages and areas of cleared mountains. They live in houses made of bamboo and cogon grass. Aetas are found in Zambales, Tarlac, Pampanga, Angeles, Olongapo, Panay, Bataan and Nueva Ecija. But because of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, some of them moved to resettlement areas in Pampanga and Tarlac. Mining, deforestation, illegal logging, and slash-and-burn farming has caused the indigenous population in all parts of the Philippines to steadily decrease to the point where they number in the thousands today. The Philippines affords them no protection. In addition, the Aeta have become extremely nomadic due to social and economic strain on their culture and way of life that had previously remained unchanged for thousands of years. Demographics. The life expectancy at birth of the Aeta is just 16.5 years, with only a third of children surviving to adulthood at 15 years – at which point life expectancy is still only 27.3 years. Young women reach full adult height (average ) at age 12 or 13. The most thorough longitudinal study done of any Aeta group (or any ethnic community) is available on the Web. Culture. Language. All Aeta communities have adopted the language of their Austronesian Filipino neighbors, which have sometimes diverged over time to become different languages. These include, in order of number of speakers, Mag-indi, Mag-antsi, Abellen, Ambala, and Mariveleño. Religion. There are different views on the dominant character of the Aeta religion. Those who believe they are monotheistic argue that various Aeta tribes believe in a supreme being who rules over lesser spirits or deities, with the Aeta of Mt. Pinatubo worshipping ""Apo Na"". The Aetas are also animists. For example, the Pinatubo Aeta believe in environmental spirits such as anito and kamana. They believe that good and evil spirits inhabit the environment, such as the spirits of the river, sea, sky, mountain, hill, valley and other places.  No special occasion is needed for the Aeta to pray, although there is a clear link between prayer and economic activities. The Aeta dance before and after a pig hunt. The night before Aeta women gather shellfish, they perform a dance which is partly an apology to the fish and partly a charm to ensure the catch. Similarly, the men hold a bee dance before and after the expeditions for honey. In the mid-60s missionaries of the American-based Evangelical Protestant mission group New Tribes Mission, in their effort to reach every Philippine tribal group with the Christian Gospel reached out to the Agtas/Aetas. The mission agency provided education including pastoral training for natives to reach members of their own tribe. Today, a large percentage of Agtas/Aetas of Zambales and Pampanga are Evangelicals. Jehovah's Witnesses also have members of the Aeta people. (See 1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses) Clothing. Their traditional clothing is very plain. The young women wear wrap around skirts. Elder women wear bark cloth, while elder men wear loin cloths. The old women of the Agta wear a bark cloth strip which passes between the legs, and is attached to a string around the waist. Today most Aeta who have been in contact with lowlanders have adopted the T-shirts, pants and rubber sandals commonly used by the latter. Practices. The Aetas are skillful in weaving and plaiting.  Women exclusively weave winnows and mats. Only men make armlets. They also produce raincoats made of palm leaves whose bases surround the neck of the wearer, and whose topmost part spreads like a fan all around the body. Medicine. Aeta women are known around the country as experts of the herbal medicines. Art. A traditional form of visual art is body scarification. The Aetas intentionally wound the skin on their back, arms, breast, legs, hands, calves and abdomen, and then they irritate the wounds with fire, lime and other means to form scars. Other ""decorative disfigurements"" include the chipping of the teeth. With the use of a file, the Dumagat modify their teeth during late puberty. The teeth are dyed black a few years afterwards.  The Aetas generally use ornaments typical of people living in subsistence economies. Flowers and leaves are used as earplugs for certain occasions. Girdles, necklaces, and neckbands of braided rattan incorporated with wild pig bristles are frequently worn. Music. The Aeta have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles – ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument.

wikipedia-1266095," Fehu  The Fe rune (Old Norse ""fé""; Old English ""feoh"") represents the ""f""-sound in the Younger Futhark and Futhorc alphabets. Its name means ""(mobile) wealth"", cognate to English ""fee"" with the original meaning of ""sheep"" or ""cattle"" (Dutch ""Vee"", German ""Vieh"", Latin ""pecum"", Sanskrit ""pashu""). The rune derives from the unattested but reconstructed Proto-Germanic *fehu in the Elder Futhark alphabet, with the original meaning of ""money, cattle, wealth"". The corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet is ""f"", called ""faihu"". Such correspondence between all rune poems and the Gothic letter name, as well, is uncommon, and gives the reconstructed name of the Old Futhark a high degree of certainty. The shape of the rune is likely based on Etruscan ""v"" , like Greek Digamma and Latin F ultimately from Phoenician waw . Rune poems. The name is recorded in all three rune poems: "
wikipedia-1266098," Impatiens glandulifera  Impatiens glandulifera is a large annual plant native to the Himalayas. Via human introduction it is now present across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Etymology. The common names Policeman's Helmet, Bobby Tops, Copper Tops, and Gnome's Hatstand all originate from the flowers being decidedly hat-shaped. Himalayan Balsam and Kiss-me-on-the-mountain arise from the fact that the plant originates in the Himalayan mountains. The ""species"" name ""glandulifera"" comes from the Latin words ""glandis"" meaning 'gland', and ""ferre"" meaning 'to bear', in that the plant has glands that produce a sticky, sweet-smelling, and edible nectar. Description. It typically grows to 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.5 ft) high, with a soft green or red-tinged stem, and lanceolate leaves 5 to 23 cm (2 to 9 in) long. The crushed foliage has a strong musty smell. The flowers are pink, with a hooded shape, 3 to 4 cm (1¼ to 1½ in) tall and 2 cm (¾ in) broad; the flower shape has been compared to a policeman's helmet, giving rise to the alternative common name Policeman's Helmet. Although it does not range all over India and is by no means the only ""Impatiens"" native to that country, it is also known as Indian Balsam in countries where it is introduced. After flowering between June and October, the plant forms seed pods 2 to 3 cm (¾ to 1¼  in) long and 8 mm broad (¼ in), which explode when disturbed, scattering the seeds up to 7 metres (23 ft). ""Impatiens"", meaning ""impatient"", refers to this method of dispersal. The green seed pods, seeds, young leaves and shoots are all edible. Distribution. Ireland. Recorded from almost all counties of Ireland. Invasive species. Himalayan Balsam is sometimes cultivated for its flowers. It is now widely established in other parts of the world (such as the British Isles and the United States), in some cases becoming an invasive species weed. The aggressive seed dispersal, coupled with high nectar production which attracts pollinators, often allows the Himalayan Balsam to outcompete native plants. In the UK the plant was first introduced in 1839 at the same time as Giant Hogweed and Japanese Knotweed. These plants were all promoted at the time as having the virtues of ""herculean proportions"" and ""splendid invasiveness"" which meant that ordinary people could buy them for the cost of a packet of seeds to rival the expensive orchids grown in the greenhouses of the rich. Within ten years, however, Himalayan balsam had escaped from the confines of cultivation and begun to spread along the river systems of England. Today it has spread across most of the UK and some local wildlife trusts organise ""balsam bashing"" events to help control the plant. However, a recent study (Hejda & Pyšek, 2006) concludes that in some circumstances, such efforts may cause more harm than good. Destroying riparian stands of Himalayan Balsam can open up the habitat for more aggressive invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed and aid in seed dispersal (by dropped seeds sticking to shoes). Riparian habitat is suboptimal for ""I. glandulifera"", and spring or autumn flooding destroys seeds and plants. The research suggests that the optimal way to control the spread of riparian Himalayan Balsam is to decrease eutrophication, thereby permitting the better-adapted local vegetation that gets outgrown by the balsam on watercourses with high nutrient load to rebound naturally. Regarding stands of the plant at forest edges and meadow habitats, they caution that these conclusions do probably not hold true; in such localities, manual destruction is apparently still the best way to stem or slow the expansion of Himalayan Balsam. The Bionic Control of Invasive Weeds in Wiesbaden, Germany, is trying to establish a self-sufficient project to conserve their local biodiversity by developing several food products made from the Impatiens flowers. Eventually, if all goes well, this project will have the Himalayan Balsam financing its own eradication. It is considered a ""prohibited noxious weed"" under the ""Alberta Weed Control Act 2010"". "
wikipedia-1266110," Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics  Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating fluid flows. It was developed by Gingold and Monaghan (1977) and Lucy (1977) initially for astrophysical problems. It has been used in many fields of research, including astrophysics, ballistics, volcanology, and oceanography. It is a mesh-free Lagrangian method (where the coordinates move with the fluid), and the resolution of the method can easily be adjusted with respect to variables such as the density. Method. The smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method works by dividing the fluid into a set of discrete elements, referred to as particles. These particles have a spatial distance (known as the ""smoothing length"", typically represented in equations by formula_1), over which their properties are ""smoothed"" by a ""kernel function"". This means that the physical quantity of any particle can be obtained by summing the relevant properties of all the particles which lie within the range of the kernel. For example, using Monaghan's popular cubic spline kernel the temperature at position formula_2 depends on the temperatures of all the particles within a radial distance formula_3 of formula_4. The contributions of each particle to a property are weighted according to their distance from the particle of interest, and their density. Mathematically, this is governed by the kernel function (symbol formula_5). Kernel functions commonly used include the Gaussian function and the cubic spline. The latter function is exactly zero for particles further away than two smoothing lengths (unlike the Gaussian, where there is a small contribution at any finite distance away). This has the advantage of saving computational effort by not including the relatively minor contributions from distant particles. The equation for any quantity formula_6 at any point formula_7 is given by the equation where formula_9 is the mass of particle formula_10, formula_11 is the value of the quantity formula_12 for particle formula_10, formula_14 is the density associated with particle formula_10, formula_7 denotes position and formula_5 is the kernel function mentioned above. For example, the density of particle formula_18 (formula_19) can be expressed as: where the summation over formula_10 includes all particles in the simulation. Similarly, the spatial derivative of a quantity can be obtained easily by virtue of the linearity of the derivative (del, formula_22). Although the size of the smoothing length can be fixed in both space and time, this does not take advantage of the full power of SPH. By assigning each particle its own smoothing length and allowing it to vary with time, the resolution of a simulation can be made to automatically adapt itself depending on local conditions. For example, in a very dense region where many particles are close together the smoothing length can be made relatively short, yielding high spatial resolution. Conversely, in low-density regions where individual particles are far apart and the resolution is low, the smoothing length can be increased, optimising the computation for the regions of interest. Combined with an equation of state and an integrator, SPH can simulate hydrodynamic flows efficiently. However, the traditional artificial viscosity formulation used in SPH tends to smear out shocks and contact discontinuities to a much greater extent than state-of-the-art grid-based schemes. The Lagrangian-based adaptivity of SPH is analogous to the adaptivity present in grid-based adaptive mesh refinement codes. In some ways it is actually simpler because SPH particles lack any explicit topology relating them, unlike the elements in FEM. Adaptivity in SPH can be introduced in two ways; either by changing the particle smoothing lengths or by splitting SPH particles into 'daughter' particles with smaller smoothing lengths. The first method is common in astrophysical simulations where the particles naturally evolve into states with large density differences. However, in hydrodynamics simulations where the density is often (approximately) constant this is not a suitable method for adaptivity. For this reason particle splitting can be employed, with various conditions for splitting ranging from distance to a free surface through to material shear. Often in astrophysics, one wishes to model self-gravity in addition to pure hydrodynamics. The particle-based nature of SPH makes it ideal to combine with a particle-based gravity solver, for instance tree gravity, particle mesh, or particle-particle particle-mesh. Uses in astrophysics. The adaptive resolution of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, combined with its ability to simulate phenomena covering many orders of magnitude, make it ideal for computations in theoretical astrophysics. Simulations of galaxy formation, star formation, stellar collisions, supernovae and meteor impacts are some of the wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological uses of this method. SPH is used to model hydrodynamic flows, including possible effects of gravity. Incorporating other astrophysical processes which may be important, such as radiative transfer and magnetic fields is an active area of research in the astronomical community, and has had some limited success. Uses in fluid simulation. Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics is being increasingly used to model fluid motion as well. This is due to several benefits over traditional grid-based techniques. First, SPH guarantees conservation of mass without extra computation since the particles themselves represent mass. Second, SPH computes pressure from weighted contributions of neighboring particles rather than by solving linear systems of equations. Finally, unlike grid-base technique which must track fluid boundaries, SPH creates a free surface for two-phase interacting fluids directly since the particles represent the denser fluid (usually water) and empty space represents the lighter fluid (usually air). For these reasons it is possible to simulate fluid motion using SPH in real time. However, both grid-based and SPH techniques still require the generation of renderable free surface geometry using a polygonization technique such as metaballs and marching cubes, point splatting, or ""carpet"" visualization. For gas dynamics it is more appropriate to use the kernel function itself to produce a rendering of gas column density (e.g. as done in the SPLASH visualisation package). One drawback over grid-based techniques is the need for large numbers of particles to produce simulations of equivalent resolution. In the typical implementation of both uniform grids and SPH particle techniques, many voxels or particles will be used to fill water volumes which are never rendered. However, accuracy can be significantly higher with sophisticated grid-based techniques, especially those coupled with particle methods (such as particle level sets), since it is easier to enforce the incompressibility condition in these systems. SPH for fluid simulation is being used increasingly in real-time animation and games where accuracy is not as critical as interactivity. Recent work in SPH for Fluid simulation has increased both performance and accuracy: Uses in solid mechanics. In 1990, Libersky and Petschek extended SPH to Solid Mechanics. The main advantage of SPH is the possibility of dealing with larger local distortion than grid-based methods. This feature has been exploited in many applications in Solid Mechanics: metal forming, impact, crack growth, fracture, fragmentation, etc. Another important advantage of meshfree methods in general, and of SPH in particular, is that mesh dependence problems are naturally avoided given the meshfree nature of the method. In particular, mesh alignment is related to problems involving cracks and it is avoided in SPH due to the isotropic support of the kernel functions. However, classical SPH formulations suffer from tensile instabilities and lack of consistency. Over the past years, different corrections have been introduced to improve the accuracy of the SPH solution. That is the case of Liu et al., Randles and Libersky and Johnson and Beissel, who tried to solve the consistency problem. Dyka et al. and Randles and Libersky introduced the stress-point integration into SPH and Belytschko et al. showed later that the stress-point technique removes the instability due to spurious singular modes while tensile instabilities can be avoided by using a Lagrangian kernel. Many other recent studies can be found in the literature devoted to improve the convergence of the SPH method. The recent improvements on the convergence and stabilility of SPH have allowed the use of SPH in more and more applications concerning Solid Mechanics. Here there are some examples of its last applications and recent developments of the method: "
wikipedia-1266115," Helen B. Taussig  Helen Brooke Taussig (May 24, 1898 – May 20, 1986) was an American cardiologist, working in Baltimore and Boston, who founded the field of pediatric cardiology. Notably, she is credited with developing the concept for a procedure that would extend the lives of children born with Tetrology of Fallot (also known as blue baby syndrome). This concept was applied in practice as a procedure known as the Blalock-Taussig shunt. The procedure was developed by Dr. Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, who were Taussig's colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Background. Helen Brooke Tausig was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her father was Harvard economist Frank W. Taussig, and her mother, Edith Thomas Guild, was one of the first students at Radcliffe College. When she was eleven years old, Helen's mother died. Helen struggled with severe dyslexia through her early school years, overcoming it only with diligent work and extensive tutoring from her father. She graduated Cambridge School for Girls in 1917, then studied for two years at Radcliffe before earning a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1921. She then studied at both Harvard Medical School and Boston University before pursuing her postgraduate cardiac research at Johns Hopkins University. She completed her MD degree in 1927 at Johns Hopkins, were she then continued for one year as cardiology fellow and two years as a pediatrics intern. Dr. Taussig became profoundly deaf in the later part of her career, and learned to use lip-reading to listen to her patients, and her fingers in place of a stethoscope to feel the rhythm of their heartbeats. Medicine. Dr. Taussig did extensive work on anoxemia, or blue baby syndrome, which led to the development of a pioneering cardiac surgical procedure for infants called the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt, first performed by Taussig and Dr. Alfred Blalock on an 11-month old baby girl on November 29, 1944. Taussig wrote the book ""Congenital Malformations of the Heart"" in 1947, and received the 1954 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for her work. In 1959, she was one of the first women to be awarded a full professorship at Johns Hopkins University. During this time she was aided by Dr. Haywood Turner (now deceased) from Columbus, Georgia, who worked with her for two years doing research on children's heart defects.  Taussig formally retired from Johns Hopkins in 1963, but continued to teach, give lectures, and lobby for various causes. In addition, she kept writing scientific papers (of the 100 total that Taussig wrote, 41 were after her retirement from Johns Hopkins). She advocated the use of animals in medical research and legalized abortion. Taussig also learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and testified before Congress on this matter. As a result of her efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States. In 1977, Taussig moved to a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Ever active, she continued making periodic trips to the University of Delaware for research work.  Death. Just after beginning a new study of defects in bird hearts, on May 20, 1986, while driving friends to a local election polling place, she died in a car accident. Her death came just four days before what would have been her 88th birthday. She is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Legacy. Dr. Taussig was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the following year she became the first female president of the American Heart Association. Johns Hopkins University named the ""Helen B. Taussig Children's Pediatric Cardiac Center"" in her honor, and in 2005 the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine named one of its four colleges in her honor. Film portrayals. In the 2004 HBO movie ""Something the Lord Made"", Dr. Taussig was portrayed by Mary Stuart Masterson. "
wikipedia-1266123," Spark testing  Spark testing is a method of determining the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks can be compared to a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different. Spark testing is used because it is quick, easy, and inexpensive. Moreover, test samples do not have to be prepared in any way, so, often, a piece of scrap is used. The main disadvantage to spark testing is its inability to identify a material positively; if positive identification is required, chemical analysis must be used. The spark comparison method also damages the material being tested, at least slightly. Spark testing most often is used in tool rooms, machine shops, heat treating shops, and foundries. Process. A bench grinder is usually used to create the sparks, but sometimes this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23 m/s (4500 surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58 m/s (7500–11,500 sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be in an area where there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks. The important spark characteristics are color, volume, nature of the spark, and length. Note that the length is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the grinding wheel, so this can be a poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, the grinding wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up. Compressed air method. Another less common method for creating sparks is heating up the sample to red heat and then applying compressed air to the sample. The compressed air supplies enough oxygen to ignite the sample and give off sparks. This method is more accurate than using a grinder because it will always give off sparks of the same length for the same sample. The compressed air applies in essence the same ""pressure"" each time. This makes observations of the spark length a much more reliable characteristic for comparison. Automated spark testing. Automated spark testing has been developed to remove the reliance upon operator skill and experience, thereby increasing reliability. The system relies upon spectroscopy, spectrometry, and other methods to ""observe"" the spark pattern. It has been found that this system can determine the difference between two materials that give off sparks that are indistinguishable to the human eye. History. In 1909, Max Bermann, an engineer in Budapest, was the first to discover that spark testing can be used reliably to classify ferrous material. He originally claimed to be able to distinguish different types of ferrous materials based on percent carbon and principal alloying elements. Moreover, he claimed to achieve an accuracy of 0.01% carbon content. Tschorn produced an exhaustive treatment of spark testing. His book, Spark Atlas of Steels, along with Spark Testing by Gladwin represent the two most comprehensive texts on the subject  As of the late 1980s, the industrial use of spark testing is not as common as it used to be. "
wikipedia-1266131," Burslem  The town of Burslem, known as the Mother Town, is one of the six towns that amalgamated to form the current city of Stoke-on-Trent, in the ceremonial county of Staffordshire, in the Midlands of England. Topography. Burslem is sited on the eastern ridge of the Fowlea Valley, the Fowlea being one of the main early tributaries of the River Trent. Burslem embraces the areas of Middleport, Dalehall, Longport, Westport, Trubshaw Cross, and Brownhills. The Trent & Mersey Canal cuts through, to the west and south of the town centre. A little further west, the West Coast Main Line railway and the A500 road run in parallel, forming a distinct boundary between Burslem and the abutting middle-class town of Newcastle-under-Lyme. To the south is Grange Park and Festival Park, reclaimed by the Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival. History. The Domesday Book shows Burslem (listed as ""Bacardeslim"") as a small farming hamlet; strategically sited above a vital ford (crossing) at Longport, part of the major pack horse track out of the Peak District and Staffordshire Moorlands to the Liverpool/London road. As far back as the late 12th century a thriving pottery industry existed, based on the fine & abundant local clays. After the Black Death, Burslem emerges in the records as a medieval town - the 1536 stone church is still standing and in use. Until the mid-1760s Burslem was relatively cut off from the rest of England; it had no navigable river nearby, and there were no good & reliable roads. By 1777 the Trent and Mersey Canal was nearing completion, and the roads had markedly improved. The town boomed on the back of fine pottery production & canals, and became known as 'The Mother Town' of the six towns that make up the city. In 1910 the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent, and the borough was granted city status in 1925. The famous novels of Arnold Bennett evoke the feel of Victorian Burslem, with its many potteries, mines, and working canal barges. The Burslem of the 1930s to the 1980s is evoked by the paintings and plays of Arthur Berry. Burslem contains Britain's last real working industrial district (i.e.: where people live within walking distance of the factories of a single heavy industry - in this case, the potteries); and thus much of the nineteenth-century industrial heritage, buildings & character have survived intact.  A recent report suggested the concentration of pottery-based heritage makes the area the richest stretch of canal for industrial heritage in England. Trade journals. ""BURSLEM, an ancient town, with a market held for a long period by custom, and subsequently sanctioned by an act of parliament, is about three miles from Newcastle and two from Hanley, entitled to the precedence of other towns in this district, as claiming to be the mother, as it is the metropolis, of the Staffordshire Potteries.""  1828 journal ""In the Doomsday Survey - for even in that early date Burslem was a place of some importance - the town appears, as ""Burwardeslyn;"" and frequent mention is made of it in ancient documents during the Middle Ages."" 1893 journal Population and housing. At the 1991 census count, the population of Burslem was 21,400. A study by consultants Atkins, working from the United Kingdom Census 2001 data, showed that the Burslem population is steady and has not declined despite a manufacturing decline during the 1980s and '90s.  Traditional Victorian architecture and Edwardian period terraced houses dominate the town. New housing developments are underway on the Sadlers Factory site and around Woodbank Street. Heavy industrial employment (mines, steel & pots) has left a legacy of ill-health among many older people, but there is the Haywood Hospital (High Lane, Burslem) and the new £300-million University Hospital of North Staffordshire is just three miles away by road. Burslem is a multicultural area of Stoke-on-Trent with a significant Asian population. Economy. Industrial scale pottery production has drastically declined since the 1970s; but specialist makers (Steelite) and smaller producers of high-value ceramics (Burleigh, Wade, Moorcroft) are thriving. Burslem is emerging as a centre for small, freelance creative businesses working in sectors such as fine art, animation and crafts as well as pottery. Shopping options in the town centre have markedly declined, hit by the impact of nearby out-of-town retail parks that offer free parking. However, the evening economy is still active with a wide range of bars and restaurants mainly serving English and Indian food.  The Leopard Inn, on Market Place, has become internationally well-known following its appearance on Most Haunted in 2007. Sometimes known as the 'Savoy of the Midlands' the Leopard Inn in Burslem certainly holds a lot of hidden secrets. The Leopard Inn is one of Stoke-on-Trent's hidden gems. A listed building in Burslem, it is steeped in history and the discovery of tunnels and 58 bedrooms that have been left exactly as they were when they were sealed between the 1930s and 1950s has brought it centre-stage again. The Leopard Inn dates from the early 1700s. Initially a coaching house and Inn, there has been a working pub on this site for 300 years or more. In 1878 a three storey extension including 57 rooms were built. The ambition was to create in Burslem 'The Savoy of the North'. The rooms to the front of the Leopard are today in use as a pub and restaurant, and to the rear the hotel lies abandoned and purportedly haunted. At Spring 2002 unemployment was running at 4.1 percent or 1,526 people in the Stoke-on-Trent North constituency; almost the same rate as the West Midlands as a whole. In Burslem at 2001 unemployment was 3.2 percent and declining. In 2005, £2-million of new business park units for the creative industries was announced for the town. New business parks are planned for 2006/7 just to the north (Chatterley Valley, £40m+) and the south (Etruria Valley, £100m+) of the town. Media. In 2007 Burslem saw a social enterprise newspaper, Local Edition, become one of the first newspapers to cover the area regularly. The newspaper covered Burslem, as well as surrounding areas including Tunstall, Middleport and Cobridge, giving a voice to the people in the community. The newspaper ceased publication in 2008 and its archive is online. Tourism. Around 5 million tourists visit Stoke-on-Trent each year, supporting around 4,400 direct jobs. Stoke shows its popularity through the number of repeat visits; around 80 percent of visitors have previously been here. Burslem has a variety of strong tourist attractions; Burleigh, Moorcroft, Festival Park, its many authentic English pubs, and the Trent & Mersey Canal. Even though ceramica is probably the biggest building in Burslem, not many people know that it was once the town hall. It also has the legacy of novelist Arnold Bennett, who refers to the town and many of its streets with thinly-disguised names: e.g. Burslem/""Bursley"", Swan (Square and Pub)/""Duck"". It is the setting for one of his most famous works, the Clayhanger trilogy. Burslem's centre benefits from having an almost-intact medieval street-plan and countless fine old buildings, and a townscape which almost-totally escaped re-development during the 1960s and 1970s. After being under-used for years, the Burslem School of Art has been refurbished at a cost of £2.1m and offers several large free art galleries. The free Public Library is currently based in the School of Art, after the Venetian Gothic Wedgwood Institute closed for safety reasons early in 2009. Ceramica was a new award-winning ceramics family attraction, based in the imposing old Town Hall and funded by Millennium Lottery money but due to the loss of council funding has been closed. The Queen's Theatre has regular concerts and an annual pantomime.  There is a traditional Friday street market, and street carnivals in May and December. Sports. The major football club Port Vale F.C. is based in Burslem at Vale Park. The team currently plays in League One, England's third division. Near to the town is Burslem Golf Club - a 9-hole course which once had singer Robbie Williams as a Junior Captain. It was opened on 28 September 1907 by vaudeville entertainer and golfer Sir Harry Lauder. On 29 September 2007 his great-nephew Gregory Lauder-Frost as guest-of-honour rededicated it for another century in a formal ceremony. Education. Burslem is the site of the main campus of Stoke-on-Trent College, the largest Further Education college in England. The campus specialises in media-production and drama. Stoke Studio College, a studio school for 13-19 year olds is opening at the college campus in September 2013. Within a six mile radius from Burslem there are three universities; Staffordshire at Shelton, Keele University, and Manchester Metropolitan's large Art & Design campus at Alsager. The environment. The town is elevated and is not prone to flooding. Burslem has a Victorian park designed by Thomas Hayton Mawson, and a large amount of reclaimed green space, such as the Westport Lakes and the later legacy of the 1986 National Garden Festival, which imaginatively reclaimed part of the Shelton Bar steelworks site. The Peak District National Park begins just ten miles north-east of Burslem. Transport. The nearby A500 gives access to the M6 motorway. Longport railway station offers direct connections south into Stoke, east to Derby and Nottingham, and north to Crewe & Manchester. The town is straddled by two major off-road cycle paths, part of the National Cycle Network.  The Trent and Mersey canal is said to see over 10,000 narrowboats a year using it. The former Burslem Canal was constructed in 1805 and remained open until 1961 when it was breached. The Burslem Canal was a branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal running from the junction near to Newport Lane (opposite the old steel works) though to Furlong Lane area of Middleport. The nearest international airports are Manchester & Birmingham International; each is about 60 minutes away by train. Burslem was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 1 November 1873. Notable people. Possibly Burslem's current most famous son is Robbie Williams, who is a major shareholder in Port Vale. His family are still resident in the area. Other notable figures include the potter Josiah Wedgewood; the watercolour painter James Holland (1800–1870); the founder, bassist and lead singer of one of Britain's foremost rock bands - Ian ""Lemmy"" Kilmister of Motörhead - he was born and spent his early childhood in the town; and Darts legend and 15-time world champion, Phil Taylor who was born, raised and also worked in the town. In the 17th century, Molly Leigh was resident of the town before being accused of being a witch and dying before her trial. William Frederick Horry owned the George Hotel in the 1860s before murdering his wife Jane at his father's house in Boston, Lincolnshire. Despite pleas for clemency he was hanged at Lincoln Castle on 1 April 1872 and his body interred with other executed felons in the interior of the Castle's Lucy Tower, where it can still be seen. In popular culture. George Fomby's first sound film, ""Boots! Boots!"", got its world premiere in Burslem in 1934. The film adaptation of Arnold Bennett's ""The Card"" was partly filmed on location in the town. Robbie Williams published a song, ""Burslem Normals"" in ""Rudebox"" (album), released in 2006. A short film, ""Goodbye to the Normals"" was made. A song ""Waterloo Road"" performed by Jason Crest was written (by Mike Deighan and Mike Wilsh) about the Waterloo Road in Burslem. The song became very popular and even reached #1 in France when the French singer, Joe Dassin, covered it under the title, ""Les Champs Élysées"". The famous guitarist, Slash, the ex Lead guitarist of Guns N' Roses, was also an inhabitant of Stoke-on-Trent in his early years. "
wikipedia-1266144," California High-Speed Rail  The California High-Speed Rail project is a planned high-speed rail system in the state of California and headed by the California High-Speed Rail Authority, commonly referred to simply as the Authority. Initial funding for the project was approved by California voters on November 4, 2008, with the passage of Proposition 1A authorizing the issuance of US$9.95 billion in general obligation bonds for the project. According to the Authority website, it is ""responsible for planning, designing, building and operation of the first high-speed rail system in the nation. California high-speed rail will connect the mega-regions of the state, contribute to economic development and a cleaner environment, create jobs and preserve agricultural and protected lands. By 2029, the system will run from San Francisco to the Los Angeles basin in under three hours at speeds capable of over 200 miles per hour. The system will eventually extend to Sacramento and San Diego, totaling 800 miles with up to 24 stations. In addition, the Authority is working with regional partners to implement a state-wide rail modernization plan that will invest billions of dollars in local and regional rail lines to meet the state’s 21st century transportation needs."" On July 6, 2012, the California legislature approved construction financing for an initial stage of the project. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill on July 18. The funding approved includes $4.5 billion in bonds previously approved by voters, which, in turn, freed up $3.2 billion in federal funding that would otherwise have expired after July 6. $2.6 billion will be used to build an initial segment of high-speed line from Madera to just north of Bakersfield in the Central Valley. Funding will also be used for several ""bookend"" and connectivity projects designed to integrate the future high-speed rail system with existing local and regional rail lines. This blended approach was adopted in a revised Authority business plan approved in April 2012, and is expected to reduce construction costs while providing immediate benefits to rail users in the state. The business plan promises to give priority to closing the gap in passenger rail service between Bakersfield and the Los Angeles area. The plan estimates final cost at Year-Of-Expenditure (YOE) $68 billion for the Phase 1 project, connecting San Francisco with Los Angeles via Central Valley and Palmdale. History. 1980s Plans for a high speed train system linking Northern and Southern California were proposed by Governor Jerry Brown in the 1980s. 1990s In 1996, the California High-Speed Rail Authority was established to begin formal planning in preparation for a ballot measure in 1998 or 2000. 2000s The ballot measure was originally scheduled to be put before voters in the 2004 general election, however, the state legislature voted twice to move it back, first to 2006, and finally to 2008 when voters approved the issuing of bonds with 52.7% voting in favor. The cost of the initial San Francisco-to-Anaheim segment was originally estimated by the Authority to be $ (2008) / $ (), but a revised business plan released in November 2011 by the Authority put the cost at $ (2010) / $ () / $ (YOE). The latest plan has revised the costs down to $ (2011) / $ () / $ (YOE). An implementation plan approved in August 2005 estimated that it would take eight to eleven years to ""develop and begin operation of an initial segment of the California high-speed train."" 2010s On December 2, 2010, the Board of Directors voted to begin construction on the first section of the system from Madera to Fresno. On December 20, 2010, with the infusion of an additional $616 million in federal funds reallocated from states that canceled their high-speed rail plans, the initial segment of construction was extended to Bakersfield. Another $300 million was reallocated on May 9, 2011, extending the funded portion north to the future Chowchilla Wye, so that the train can be turned. Construction is expected to begin in 2013. In September 2012, the Obama administration gave California's high speed rail project the green light. President Obama put the project on a fast track. President Obama's plan would streamline the permitting process for the section of the project which starts just north of Fresno in Madera County and runs south to Bakersfield. On August 20, 2013 the joint venture of Tutor Perini/Zachary/Parsons announced that it had executed a contract with the Authority for the design and construction of the initial Madera to Fresno segment of the California high-speed rail system. The contract is valued at approximately $985 million, plus an additional $53 million in provisional sums. Route. The system will extend from San Francisco and Sacramento, via the Central Valley, to Los Angeles and San Diego via the Inland Empire. As planned, the track from San Francisco to Los Angeles would be 520 miles. Possible stations are shown on the statewide rail modernization map at right. In January, 2012, the Authority released a study, started in May 2011, that favors a route through Antelope Valley over one that parallels Interstate 5. Diablo Range crossing track alignment. One issue initially debated was the crossing of the Diablo Range via either the Altamont Pass or the Pacheco Pass to link the Bay Area to the Central Valley. On November 15, 2007, Authority staff recommended that the High Speed Rail follow the Pacheco Pass route because it is more direct and serves both San Jose and San Francisco on the same route, while the Altamont route poses several major engineering obstacles, including crossing San Francisco Bay. Some cities along the Altamont route, such as Pleasanton and Fremont, opposed the Altamont route option, citing concerns over possible property taking and increase in traffic congestion. However, environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have opposed the Pacheco route because the area is less developed and more environmentally sensitive than Altamont. On December 19, 2007, the Authority Board of Directors agreed to proceed with the Pacheco Pass option. Pacheco Pass was considered the superior route for long-distance travel between Southern California and the Bay Area, although the Altamont Pass option would serve as a good commuter route. The Authority plans conventional rail upgrades for the Altamont corridor, to complement the high-speed project. Segments. San Francisco to San Jose. The bookend from San Francisco to San Jose currently used by Caltrain is scheduled to be electrified by 2020. High speed trains will run at reduced speeds on this segment beginning with Bay to Basin in 2026, and then on dedicated HSR infrastructure for Phase 1 Blended in 2029. San Jose to Merced. The from San Jose to Merced, crossing the Pacheco Pass, will run on dedicated HSR tracks for Bay to Basin in 2026 (since the current right of way south of Tamien is freight-owned). Merced to Fresno. The segment from Merced to Fresno in the Central Valley will run on dedicated HSR tracks for the Initial Operating Section in 2022. Fresno to Bakersfield. The Fresno to Bakersfield segment in the Central Valley will run on dedicated HSR tracks for the Initial Operating Section in 2022. Bakersfield to Palmdale. The from Bakersfield to Palmdale, crossing the Tehachapi Pass, will run on dedicated HSR tracks for the Initial Operating Section in 2022. Palmdale to Los Angeles. The bookend from Palmdale to Los Angeles, crossing the San Gabriel Mountains, will run on dedicated HSR tracks for Phase 1 Blended in 2029. XpressWest has plans to connect to Palmdale, and have passengers transfer to the Metrolink system to access the Los Angeles area, for their Los Angeles to Las Vegas high speed service in 2016. Los Angeles to Anaheim. The from Los Angeles to Anaheim will run on an upgraded Metrolink corridor for Phase 1 Blended in 2029. Los Angeles to San Diego. The from Los Angeles to San Diego will be built in Phase 2. Merced to Sacramento. The from Merced to Sacramento will be built in Phase 2. Travel times. High-speed trains will provide door-to-door travel times comparable to airplanes and less than one-half as long as car travel. Below is a sample of travel times throughout the state. Development schedule. California and Federal ARRA funds are available to complete a initial segment from Fresno to Bakersfield in the Central Valley by 2017. This segment would connect with BNSF tracks at each end to allow the Amtrak ""San Joaquin"" trains to use the line, saving 45 minutes to an hour. The selection of the Central Valley as the location for initial construction was dictated in part by the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funding, which stipulates that funding terminates in 2017 and that it be used for “rail passenger transportation except commuter rail passenger transportation."" (p. 2-12) The 2012 Business Plan (Exhibit ES-3) projects the completion dates (shown at right) for high speed rail segments, assuming additional funding can be obtained. No dates are given for the Phase 2 segments, Merced–Sacramento and Los Angeles–San Diego. Benefits. The 2012 Business Plan estimates that the first segment's construction will ""generate 20,000 jobs over five years,"" with the Phase 1 system requiring 990,000 job-years over 15 years, averaging 66,000 annually. In 2009, the Authority projected that construction of the system will create 450,000 permanent jobs through the new commuters that will use the system, and that the Los Angeles-San Francisco route will generate a net operating revenue of $2.23 billion by 2023, consistent with the experience of other high-speed intercity operations around the world. Even Amtrak's semi-high-speed ""Acela Express"" service generates an operating surplus that is used to cover operating expenses of other lines. Generally fast trains are more profitable than slow trains since shorter travel time reduces staff costs and customers are willing to pay higher ticket prices for shorter travel times. Since the trains will be completely grade-separated, there is no threat of interfering with automobile and pedestrian traffic. The project also involves grade-separation for existing rail lines with which it will share rights-of-way along part of its length, further improving safety on these lines and eliminating car traffic delays.(p. 2-7) According to a fact sheet on the Authority website the environmental benefits of the system include: In 2022, when the Initial Operating Section (Merced to the San Fernando Valley) is up and running, the resulting GHG reductions will be between 100,000 to 300,000 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in the first year. That’s the equivalent of from between 17,700 to 53,000 personal vehicles taken off the road. Between 2022 and 2040, the cumulative reduction of CO2 is estimated to be between 5 and 10 million metric tons. By 2040, the system will reduce vehicles miles of travel in the state by almost 10 million miles of travel every day. Over a 58 year period (from the start of operations in 2022 through 2080), the system will reduce auto travel on the state’s highways and roads by over 400 billion miles of travel. Criticisms. In September 2008, Reason Foundation, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and the Citizens Against Government Waste groups published ""The California High Speed Rail Proposal: A Due Diligence Report"". The report projected that the final cost for the complete system would be $65.2 to $81.4 billion (2008). This is significantly higher than estimates made for the Authority by Parsons Brinckerhoff, an American engineering firm. It also projected fewer riders by 2030 than officially estimated: 23.4 to 31.1 million intercity riders a year instead of the 65.5 to 96.5 million forecast by the Authority and later confirmed by an independent peer review. The report stated that no existing high-speed rail train currently meets the proposed speed and safety goals, although the safety systems have not been fully specified, and that the reduction in CO2 emissions would be inconsequential. The time required to reach the proposed speeds, the distances between stops, and the fact that for part of the route the high speed trains will travel on regular freight train tracks rather than upgraded high speed rail tracks indicates that attaining the proposed speeds would be difficult between the majority of stops. The following people were listed in the official voter information guide as opponents for the November 2008 vote: Hon. Chuck DeVore, California State Assemblyman; Richard Tolmach, President California Rail Foundation; Mike Arnold, Ph.D., Co-Chair Marin Citizens for Effective Transportation; Hon. Tom McClintock, State Senator; Hon. George Runner, State Senator; and Jon Coupal, President Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. The California Legislative Analyst's Office published recommendations on May 10, 2011, which they said will help the high-speed rail project be developed successfully. They recommended that the California legislature seek flexibility on use of federal funds and then reconsider where construction of the high-speed rail line should start. They also recommended that the California legislature shift responsibility away from the Authority and fund only the administrative tasks of the Authority in the 2011–12 budget. The Authority released a revised business plan for the system on November 1, 2011, with a new cost estimate of $68.4 billion (2010 dollars), almost double the initial budget of $33 billion (2008 dollars) approved by referendum, along with a revised completion date was pushed from 2020 to 2033 if a Full Build option is chosen instead of the Blended System. This latest price estimate by the Authority for a Full Build option is $91.4 billion, according to the 2012 Business Plan. The Legislative Analyst's Office published a new report in December 2011 indicating that the incremental development path outlined by CHSRA may not be legal. According to the State Analyst, ""Proposition 1A identifies certain requirements that must be met prior to requesting an appropriation of bond proceeds for construction. These include identifying for a corridor, or a usable segment thereof, all sources of committed funds, the anticipated time of receipt of those funds, and completing all project-level environmental clearances for that segment. Our review finds that the funding plan only identifies committed funding for the ICS (San Joaquin Valley segment), which is not a usable segment, and therefore does not meet the requirements of Proposition 1A. In addition, the HSRA has not yet completed all environmental clearances for any usable segment and will not likely receive all of these approvals prior to the expected 2012 date of initiating construction."" In January 2012, an independent peer review panel published a report recommending the Legislature not approve issuing $2.7 billion in bonds to fund the project. The panel of experts was created by state law to help safeguard the public's interest. The report said that moving ahead on the high-speed rail project without credible sources of adequate funding represents a financial risk to California. Prior to the July 2012 vote, State Senator Joe Simitian, (D-Palo Alto), expressed concerns about financing needed to complete the project, asking: ""Is there additional commitment of federal funds? There is not. Is there additional commitment of private funding? There is not. Is there a dedicated funding source that we can look to in the coming years? There is not."" The lobbying and advocacy group Train Riders Association of California also considers that Bill SB 1029 ""provides no high-speed service for the next decade"". By March 2013, according to a Public Policy Institute of California poll, only 43 percent of likely voters supported the project, a decline of 10 percent from when the measure passed in 2008. Elon Musk has criticised the project as too expensive and resulting in a train that is too slow. On August 12, 2013 he released a high-level alpha design for a Hyperloop transit system concept which he claimed would travel over three times as fast and cost less than a tenth of the rail proposal. The following day he announced a plan to construct a demonstration of the concept. Musk's claims have been subject to significant debate and criticism. Funding. On November 4, 2008, California voters approved Proposition 1A, a measure to construct the initial segment of the network. The measure provides $9.95 billion for the construction of the core segment between San Francisco and Los Angeles/Anaheim, and an additional $950 million for improvements on local railroad systems, which will serve as feeder systems to the planned high-speed rail system. Financing plans to complete the initial segment require as-yet-unsecured support from federal and local governments, as well as significant investment from the private sector. In a plan developed by the CHSRA in conjunction with Goldman Sachs, the federal commitment was expected to be $12 to $16 billion, while private investors would invest up to $7.5 billion, leaving an additional $10 billion to come from local governments. Construction costs are projected to be approximately $98.5 billion (year of expenditure). The Authority projects the initial operating segment to produce a budget surplus which will be used to finance extensions to Sacramento and San Diego. On October 2, 2009, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled California's official application for ARRA high-speed rail stimulus funding. The total amount of the application was $4.7 billion, representing more than half of the $8 billion set aside for high-speed rail. The application included: On January 28, 2010, the White House announced that California would receive $2.35 billion of its request, of which $2.25 billion was allocated specifically for California High Speed Rail, while the rest was designated for conventional rail improvements. On October 28, 2010, the federal government awarded the Authority a further $900 million for passenger rail improvements, including $715 million specifically for the high speed rail project, but with the requirement that it be used for the Central Valley segments from Merced to Fresno, or Fresno-to-Bakersfield. While the CHSRA recognizes the federal government's desire for the initial segment to be built in the Central Valley, the Authority states that it will evaluate the starting segment according to its own criteria. This announcement brings the federal government's funding commitment to high-speed rail projects in California to $4.3 billion. On December 10, 2010, the Department of Transportation reallocated $1.2 billion in federal high speed rail funding from states that had rejected the stimulus funds, including Wisconsin and Ohio. Nearly half of this funding, $624 million, was redirected to the Authority for use on the initial Central Valley leg of the project. On May 9, 2011, the Department of Transportation reallocated $2 billion in federal high speed rail funding from Florida, which had rejected the funding. The DOT awarded $300 million to the Authority for a extension along the Central Valley Corridor. The work funded in this round will extend the track and civil work from Fresno to the Chowchilla Wye, which will provide a connection to San Jose to the West and Merced to the North. The California High Speed Rail Authority issued a draft Business Plan on November 1, 2011, for public review and comment. The Business Plan will shape the financial and operational implementation of the HSR project, and must be adopted and submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2012 and every two years thereafter. "

wikipedia-1266153," Ivan Cankar  Ivan Cankar () (10 May 1876 – 11 December 1918) was a Slovene writer, playwright, essayist, poet and political activist. Together with Oton Župančič, Dragotin Kette, and Josip Murn, he is considered as the beginner of modernism in Slovene literature. He is regarded as the greatest writer in the Slovene language, and has sometimes been compared to Franz Kafka and James Joyce. Biography. Ivan Cankar was born in the Carniolan town of Vrhnika near Ljubljana. He was one of the many children of a poor artisan who emigrated to Bosnia shortly after Ivan's birth. He was raised by his mother, with whom he established a close, but ambivalent relationship. The figure of a self-sacrificing and submissively repressive mother would later become one of the most recognizable features of Cankar's prose. After finishing grammar school in his hometown, he studied at the Technical High School (""Realka"") in Ljubljana.  During this period, he started writing literature, mostly poetry, under the influence of Romantic and post-Romantic poets such as France Prešeren, Heinrich Heine, Simon Jenko and Simon Gregorčič. In 1893, he discovered the epic poetry of Anton Aškerc, which had a huge influence on the development of his style and ideals. Under Aškerc's influence, Cankar rejected the sentimental post-Romantic poetry and embraced literary realism and national liberalism.  In 1896, he enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied engineering, but later switched to Slavic philology. In Vienna, he soon started to lead a bohemian lifestyle. He came under the influence of contemporary European literature, especially decadentism, symbolism and naturalism. He became friends with Fran Govekar, a young Slovene writer and intellectual living in Vienna, who introduced him to positivism and naturalism. Between 1897 and 1899, Cankar's core ideas were essentially positivistic. In the spring of 1897 he moved back to Vrhnika. After his mother's death in autumn of the same year, he moved to Pula and in 1898 back to Vienna, where he lived until 1909.  During his second stay in Vienna, Cankar's worldview underwent a deep change. In a famous letter to the Slovene feminist author Zofka Kveder in 1900 he rejected positivism and naturalism. He embraced spiritualism, symbolism and idealism, and later publicly broke with Fran Govekar. At the same time, he became highly critical of Slovene liberalism, published a devastating criticism of Anton Aškerc's poetry and gradually moved towards socialism. He was strongly influenced by the Slovene Roman Catholic priest and thinker Janez Evangelist Krek, who advocated radical social activism on a Christian basis. He nevertheless continued to oppose the clericalism and conservativism of Austrian Christian socialists in general and Krek's Slovene People's Party in particular. He joined the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, an Austro-Marxist party active in the Slovene Lands and in Istria. In the first general elections to the Austrian Parliament in 1907, he ran as a candidate for the party in the largely working-class electoral district of Zagorje-Litija in Carniola, but lost to a candidate of the Slovene People's Party.  In 1909, he left Vienna and moved to Sarajevo in Bosnia and Hercegovina, where his brother Karlo worked as a priest. During his stay in Sarajevo, he gradually turned away from his previous militant anti-clericalism, becoming more receptive to Christian spirituality. The same year, he settled in the Rožnik district of Ljubljana. Although he remained an active member of the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, he rejected the party's view on Yugoslav nation-building: in a resolution in 1909, the party favoured a gradual unification of Slovene culture and language with the Serbo-Croatian ones in order to create a common Yugoslav cultural nation. Cankar, on the other hand, strongly defended the national and linguistic individuality of Slovenes. Together with Mihajlo Rostohar, he became the most vocal defender of Slovene individuality within a South Slavic political framework. Already after his electoral defeat in 1907, Cankar had started to publish numerous essays explaining his political and aesthetic views and opinions. After his return to Carniola in 1909, he began travelling throughout the Slovene Lands, delivering lectures and conferences. The most famous of these lectures were ""The Slovene people and the Slovene culture"" (""Slovensko ljudstvo in slovenska kultura""), delivered in Trieste in 1907, and ""Slovenes and Yugoslavs"" (""Slovenci in Jugoslovani""), delivered in Ljubljana in 1913. In the latter, Cankar expressed a favourable opinion on the political unification of all South Slavs, but rejected a cultural merger of South Slavic peoples. Because of the lecture, he was sentenced to one week in prison for defamation of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.  After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was again imprisoned in Ljubljana Castle for supposed pro-Serbian attitudes, but was soon released.  In 1917, he was drafted in the Austro-Hungarian Army, but was demobilized due to poor health. In his last lecture, delivered in the National Club of Trieste just after the end of the War, he called for a moral purification and rejuvenation of Slovene politics and culture. He moved from Rožnik to the center of Ljubljana, where he died in December 1918. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd and highest representatives from the cultural and political life in Slovenia. In 1936, his grave was moved to the Žale cemetery in Ljubljana, where he was buried next to his youth friends and fellow authors Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn. Work. Ivan Cankar wrote around 30 books and is considered one of the primary exponents of Slovene modernist literature, alongside Oton Župančič, Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn. Cankar is also considered one of Europe's most important fin de siècle. He dealt with social, national and moral themes. In Slovenia, his best-known works are the play ""Hlapci"" (""Serfs""), the satire ""Pohujšanje v dolini Šentflorijanski"" (Scandal in St. Florian Valley) and the novel ""Na klancu"" (On the Hill). However, his importance for Slovene and European literature probably lies in his symbolist sketches and other short stories, which, in their mixture of symbolism, modernism and even expressionism, convey a high degree of originality. Cankar started as a poet. He published his first poems already as a teenager in the prestigious liberal literary magazine ""Ljubljanski zvon"". In Vienna, he frequented a group of young Slovene artists and authors, among whom were Oton Župančič, Fran Eller and Fran Govekar, who introduced him to the modernist currents of European literature. In 1899, Cankar published his first collection of poetry under the title ""Erotika"". Decadentist and sensualist influences were evident and the then bishop of Ljubljana Anton Bonaventura Jeglič was so scandalized by the book that he bought all the copies and ordered their destruction. Another edition was issued three years later, but by that time Cankar had already abandoned poetry and moved to engaged literature. In 1902, he wrote his first play ""Za narodov blagor"" (For the Welfare of the Nation), which was a violent parody of the liberal nationalist elite in the Slovene Lands, especially in Carniola. The same year, he published the short novel ""Na klancu"" (On the Hill), in which he described the misery of the small rural proletariat and the poor material and spiritual conditions of the common people. The novel, which still showed strong naturalistic features, combined with allegorical symbolism and an unusual, biblically inspired style, gained him widespread recognition. In the novels ""Gospa Judit"" (Madame Judit) and ""Hiša Marije Pomočnice"" (The Ward of Mary Help of Christians) and ""Križ na gori"" (Cross on the Mountain), all published in 1904, he turned to spiritualism and idealism, maintaining as central theme the oppressed people and their yearning for a better life. In 1906, he wrote the short novel ""Martin Kačur"" with the subtitle ""The Life Story of an Idealist"", which is a ruthless analysis and self-analysis of the failure of an abstract idealist. During the general elections of 1907, he published the short story ""Hlapec Jernej in njegova pravica"" (The Servant Jernej and His Justice), in which he describes a clash between the individual worker and both the capitalist and traditional society, the laws of which he cannot understand. Following the electoral victory of the Slovene People's Party, he wrote his most influential play, the satire ""Hlapci"" (Serfs), in which he satirized the conformism of the former progressive and agnostic public servants who embraced Catholicism after the defeat of the liberal party. Both the liberal and the Catholic conservative parties in the Slovene Lands reacted acrimoniously against the play: its staging was delayed until after Austria-Hungary's dissolution in Autumn 1918. In the play ""Pohujšanje v dolini Šentflorjanski"" (Scandal in St. Florian Valley), Cankar made fun of the moral rigidness and culturally backward mentality of Carniola's small semi-urban society. Cankar was also famous for his essays, most of which were published between 1907 and 1913, where he showed stylistic mastery and great irony. His last collection of short stories, entitled ""Podobe iz sanj"" (Images from Dreams), which were published posthumously in 1920, is a magically realistic and allegorical depiction of the horrors of World War I. It shows a clear move from symbolism to expressionism and it has been regarded as the finest example of Cankar's poetic prose. Personality and world view. Cankar was a relatively fragile personality, both emotionally and physically, but showed an unusually strong and persistent intellectual vigour. He was a sharp thinker, who was able of poignant criticism of both his environment and himself. He was also full of paradoxes and loved irony and sarcasm. He was an unusually sentimental and somehow ecstatic nature, intensely sensitive to ethical issues. He was very introspective: his works, which are to a large extent autobiographic, became famous for the ruthless analysis of his own deeds and misdeeds. Cankar was raised as a Roman Catholic. In his high school years, he became a typical liberal freethinker. He rejected the religious dogmas and embraced the rational explanations provided by contemporary natural and social sciences. Between 1898 and 1902, he fell under the influence of the thinkers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche. In the writings of the Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck Cankar found the idea of the existence of a world soul, with which the individual souls are connected and employed it in his own works. Already around 1903, however, he turned to an original, slightly anarchist interpretation of Marxism. His later life was marked by a gradual evolution towards orthodox Christianity, which became evident after 1910 and especially in the last year of his life. Although he never officially rejected his Roman Catholic faith, he was generally considered an agnostic, albeit sympathetic to some elements of traditional Catholic devotion. Influence. Cankar was an influential author already during his lifetime. His works were widely read and Cankar was the first author in Slovene language who could make a living exclusively from writing. He became even more influential after his death. Due to his insistence on the cultural and national specificity of the Slovene people, Cankar became the referential figure for the young generations of Slovene intellectuals who rejected the centralistic and unitaristic policies of the Serb political elite in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the early 1920s, a group of young Catholics, mostly of Christian Socialist convictions, took the title of one of Cankar's minor novels, ""Križ na gori"" (Cross on the Mountain), as the name of their journal. The group, known as the ""Crusaders"" (), became the focal point in the emergence of the Christian left in Slovenia in the 1920s and 1930s. Cankar's work and his personal world view influenced all three major literary trends in Slovene literature between 1918 and 1945: the expressionism of Catholic authors such as Ivan Pregelj, Stanko Majcen, and France Bevk, the social realism of the liberal left and Marxist authors (particularly Miško Kranjec, Prežihov Voranc, Ciril Kosmač, and Mile Klopčič) and the avantgardism of Srečko Kosovel. During the same period, Cankar's political ideas influenced the Slovene social-democratic ideologist Etbin Kristan, the Christian Democratic political theorist Andrej Gosar and the democratic thinkers Albin Prepeluh and Dragotin Lončar. Cankar's psychological introspections became a major source of Edvard Kocbek's and Anton Trstenjak's inquiry in the Slovene national character.  During the dictatorship of King Alexander (1929–1934), Cankar's works were removed from the school curriculum, because he was considered a dangerous advocate of Slovene particularism and nationalism. After 1935, his status as one of the greatest Slovene writers was never put under serious question. In 1937, the first integral collection of Cankar's work was published, edited and annotated by his cousin and conservative literary historian and critic Izidor Cankar. After World War II, the publishing house ""Cankarjeva založba"" (literally, 'Cankar Press') was established, which took care of the edition of his collected works. Cankar was especially influential as a playwright. He is considered the father of modern Slovene theatre and has had a major influence on almost all Slovene playwrights thereafter, starting from the expressionist theatre of the 1920s (Slavko Grum, Stanko Majcen). Between the 1950s and 1970s, most of the modernisators of Slovene theatre, such as Jože Javoršek, Dominik Smole, Marjan Rožanc, Primož Kozak, and Bojan Štih, have been influenced by Cankar's plays. The works of many contemporary Slovene playwrights and screenwriters, including Drago Jančar, Dušan Jovanović, Tone Partljič and Žarko Petan, continue to show a clear influence of Cankar's concepts. Many of the prominent Slovene thinkers reflected on Cankar's works, including Dušan Pirjevec Ahac, Milan Komar, and Slavoj Žižek.  Already during his lifetime, his works were translated into German, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Finnish and Russian. Later, his work has been translated also into French, English, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Polish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish. Cankar's influence outside the Slovene-speaking area has been small, although his work did influence some non-Slovene authors, such as the French Henri Bordeaux, who also published an essay on Cankar in the 1920s, the Austrian Josef Friedrich Perkonig and the Italian Fulvio Tomizza. According to the testimony of the literary critic Josip Vidmar, Cankar's novel ""Hiša Marije Pomočnice"" was well received by the famous German writer Thomas Mann, who helped to publish a German edition in 1930. Legacy. To this day, Cankar's prose is regarded as one of the finest examples of Slovene style. His influence as a novelist has faded since the 1960s, but his plays are still among the most popular theatre pieces in Slovene theatres.  Numerous streets, squares, public buildings, and institutions have been named after Ivan Cankar. During World War II, two military units of the Slovene Partisans, the Cankar Brigade and the legendary Cankar Battalion, were named after him. Since the 1980s, Slovenia's largest congress centre, Cankar Hall in Ljubljana, has borne his name. Between June 1994 and January 2007, Cankar was portrayed on the 10,000 Slovenian tolar bill. "
wikipedia-1266174," Clavioline  The clavioline is an electronic keyboard instrument, a forerunner to the analog synthesizer. It was invented by Constant Martin in 1947. It consists of a keyboard and a separate amplifier and speaker unit. The keyboard usually covered three octaves, and had a number of switches to alter the tone of the sound produced, add vibrato, and provide other effects. Several models were produced by different companies; among the more important were the Standard, Reverb, and Concert models by Gibson and Selmer in the 1950s. The 6-octave model developed by Harald Bode employed octave transposition. In England the Jennings Organ Company's first successful product was the Univox, an early self-powered electronic keyboard based on the Selmer Clavioline. Also in Japan, Ace Tone's first product Canary S-2 (1962) was designed based on Clavioline. Recordings. The clavioline has been utilized on a number of recordings in popular music as well as in film. A selection follows. "
wikipedia-1266176," Soros Fund Management  Soros Fund Management LLC is a privately held American hedge fund management firm founded in 1969 by George Soros. In 2010, it was reported to be one of the most profitable firms in the hedge fund industry, averaging a 20% annual rate of return over four decades. It is headquartered at 888 7th Avenue in New York City Overview. Soros Fund Management is the primary adviser for the Quantum Group of Funds; a family of funds dealing in international investments. The company invests in public equity and fixed income markets worldwide, as well as foreign exchange, currency, and commodity markets, and private equity and venture capital funds. The company is reported to have large investments in transportation, energy, retail, financial, and other industries, and owns stock in the Hess Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Global Ship Lease, Bluefly, and Lattice Semiconductor. The chief operations officer for the fund is Abbas F. Zuaiter whose brother Ahmad F. Zuaiter is also a company executive. The Soros's family is well-represented in the company's leadership; the founder's sons, Jonathan Soros and Robert Soros are co-deputy chairmen, Jonathan Soros is president and Robert Soros is a managing partner. History. The company was founded by president and its chairman George Soros in 1969. 1992 to 2007. In the week leading up to September 16, 1992 or ""Black Wednesday"", Quantum Funds earned $1.8 billion by shorting British pounds and buying German marks. This transaction earned Soros the title of ""the Man Who Broke the Bank of England"". On the other hand, British government policy in the period before the ejection of the pound sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System had been widely criticised for providing speculators with a one-way bet. In 2000, the Quantum Fund lost its position as the largest hedge fund in the world when its assets under management changed $10 billion to $4 billion in about a year's time. The fund's loses were a result of investments in technology stocks. That year, CEO Duncan Hennes, and the managers of the Quantum Fund, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Quota Fund, Nicholas Roditi, resigned. The restructuring of Soros Fund Management was announced in a shareholder letter that outlined its plan to merge the Quantum Fund with the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund to form the Quantum Endowment Fund. The intention was to transform the Quantum Fund into a ""lower-risk, less-speculative fund"" administrated by an outside adviser. 2008-2011. The firm acquired a stake in Lehman Brothers just prior to its failure in 2008. In 2009, Soros Fund Management partnered with six other hedge funds to acquire IndyMac Bank at a cost of $13.9 billion, thereby gaining control of an estimated $160 billion in bank loans, investments and deposits. In 2010, the company was reported to have created $32 billion in profits since 1973, making it one of the top profit making hedge funds in the industry. In 2011, the firm was reported to have $27.9 billion in assets under management and was ranked sixth on Institutional Investor's Hedge Fund 100 list. That same year, the company partnered with Silver Lake Partners to create a new fund called Silver Lake Kraftwerk whose focus was investments in the energy and natural resource sectors. In July 2011, the fund announced plans to return just under $1 billion to investors by the end of 2011 to avoid reporting requirements under the Dodd-Frank reform act and to focus on family investments. That month, the company's chief investment officer Keith Anderson, co-founder of BlackRock left the firm. "
wikipedia-1266213," Japanese settlement in the Philippines  Japanese settlement in the Philippines refers to the branch of the Japanese diaspora having historical contact with and having established themselves in what is now the Philippines. This also refers to Filipino citizens of either pure or mixed Japanese descent currently residing in the country, the latter a result of intermarriages between the Japanese and local populations. History. Pre-colonial. Contact with the Philippine islands began when Japanese traders/merchants first settled in the archipelago during the 12th century AD. Notable settlements of the period include the ones along Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese were trading with Philippine kingdoms well before the Spanish period, mainly in pottery and gold. Historical records show that Japanese traders, especially those from Nagasaki, frequently visited the Philippine shores and bartered Japanese goods for such Filipino products as gold and pearls. In the course of time, shipwrecked Japanese sailors, pirate traders, and immigrants settled in the Philippines and intermarried with the early Filipinos. When the Spaniards reached the island of Luzon in 1571, they found Japanese colonies and settlements in Manila and in some parts of the Cagayan Valley, the Cordillera region, Lingayen, Bataan, and Catanduanes Island. The relatively light complexion of the natives of Bontoc and Banaue is probably a result of the early contacts between the Japanese and other islanders from south of Japan and the natives of the Cordillera. But the ancient Philippines had a very rich tradition of pottery as verified by the finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato and other parts of the islands. Japanese texts mentioned trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) for the highly-prized Rusun and Namban jars. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (in Chinese), which means simply ""made in Luzon."" These Rusun jars, which had rokuru (wheel mark), were said to be more precious than gold because of its ability to act as tea canisters and enhance the fermentation process. Many of the important pottery traditions that spread into the Oceania region had their counterparts in the Philippines including the well-known Lapita culture. This quote from Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter: ""I hypothesize that the Sa-huynh Kalanay and Lapita pottery traditions had a common origin somewhere in the Palawan-Sarawak-Sulu Sea-Sulawesi area and that it was at this point in time and space that a second and main stage in the spread of the Austronesian languages began."" The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again verified the great pottery tradition of the Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question is whether or not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly-prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply ""made in Luzon."" The only question is whether the pottery makers were Filipinos trained in the Chinese art, or local Japanese or Chinese, or a combination of both. In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified ""Imbe"" jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka (""Chinese Pottery,"" Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: ""To the early Spaniards, the pisciculture of the Filipinos was regarded almost as a new art, so much more advanced it was than fish breeding methods in Europe."" (Commercial Progress in the Philippine Islands, Antonio M. Regidor and J. Warren T. Mason, 1905) Many have looked to Japan for an explanation for these advanced methods. The roe was transplanted to safe pens for incubation and to guard the small fry from predators. Only when sufficiently mature to fend for themselves were they released back into the wild. These days this method is practiced by fisheries throughout the world. Before the Spanish came, the Filipinos also only used large mesh nets when fishing in rivers, lakes or in the sea. This ecologically sound practice protected the young ensuring future good catches. However, the competition brought by the Spaniards resulted in the use of such small mesh nets that the Spanish themselves eventually had to regulate the nets to prevent the destruction of the fisheries. Other Pre-Spanish Filipino industries included the manufacture of liquors and vinegars like tuba, basi, etc., the production of hides for export to Japan, export of edible bird's nests from Northern Palawan to China, the raising and trade of civet cats, the manufacture of gunpowder, the making of wax for export to China, and the making of cotton stockings for export. Spanish era. The Japanese population in the Philippines has since included descendants of Japanese Catholics and other Japanese Christians who fled from the religious persecution imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period and settled during the colonial period from the 17th century until the 19th century. A statue of daimyo Ukon Takayama, who was exiled to the Philippines in 1614 because he refused to disvow his Christian beliefs, stands a patch of land across the road from the Post Office building in the Paco, Manila. In the 17th century, the Spaniards referred to the Paco Area as the 'Yellow Plaza' because of the more than 3,000 Japanese who resided there. Many of the Japanese men intermarried with Filipino women (including those of mixed or unmixed Spanish and Chinese descent), thus forming the new Japanese mestizo community. A sizeable population settled in Manila, Davao, the Visayas and in the 1600s in Dilao, Paco, and Ilocos Norte Province. This hybrid group tend to be re-assimilated either into the Filipino or the Japanese communities, and thus no accurate denominations could be established, though their estimates range from 100,000 to 200,000. Many were killed or expelled after World War II because of their alleged collaboration with the Japanese Imperial Army (mostly as translator). Many Japanese mestizos tended to deny their Japanese heritage and changed their family names in order to avoid discrimination. American period and the Post-WWII era. During the American colonial era, the number of Japanese laborers working in plantations rose so high that in the 20th century, Davao soon became dubbed as a ""Ko Nippon Koku"" (""""Little Japan"""" in Japanese) with a Japanese school, a Shinto shrine and a diplomatic mission from Japan. There is even a popular restaurant called ""The Japanese Tunnel"", which includes an actual tunnel built by the Japanese during World War II. For fear of discrimination, some fled to the mountains after World War II while many others changed their names in the attempts to assimilate. Many were also killed (""c."" 10,000 Japanese Mestizos and Japanese) while others were deported as an act of retaliation. Their Japanese identity may take on extremes, some have completely lost their Japanese identity while others have ""returned"" to Japan, the homeland of their forebears. There is also a number of contemporary Japanese-mestizos, not associated with the history of the earlier established ones, born either in the Philippines or Japan. These latter are the resultant of unions between Filipinos and recent Japanese immigrants to the Philippines or Japanese and immigrant Filipino workers in Japan. Most Japanese mestizos speak Tagalog and/or other Philippine languages. They may also be known as ""Japinos"", although this term is considered derogatory by many. There are believed to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Japanese-mestizos in the country, but no accurate figure is currently available. Thousands of war-displaced ethnic Japanese still live in the country and are denied recognition as Japanese nationals in order to return to Japan. Modern times. The recent Japanese Filipinos are descendants of 1980s and 1990s Japanese settlers usually businesspeople, most of whom are men, and (mostly female) locals. Many are children of thousands of overseas Filipino workers, who went to Japan mostly as entertainers. They are in the Philippines also to learn English. As the Filipina mothers return to the Philippines, most take their children along with them. A significant number in the U.S. today are the product of Filipino- and Japanese American intermarriages, mostly in California, Hawaii, or other U.S. states, or other U.S. territories in the Pacific, while others are Filipinos of Japanese ancestry who have migrated to the United States. Several foundations today such as the ""Federation of Nikkeijin Kai Philippines"" exist throughout the country through the efforts of prosperous Japanese descendants and expatriates to assist Filipinos of Japanese ancestry to travel in Japan to trace their roots and visit relatives, and also charity purposes such as offering working visas and educational scholarships of impoverished Japanese Filipino children. Similar organizations exist in the Visayas to commemorate and signify the historical settlement of Japanese Filipinos in the region. The Philippines also has the highest number of Japanese in the country than any other Southeast Asian country. Japanese citizenship. The Supreme Court of Japan on June 4, 2008, ruled against a law that denied citizenship to children born out of wedlock to Japanese fathers and foreign mothers. It upheld the 2003 and 2005 separate suits (of 10 Japanese-Filipino children for Japanese citizenship), filed by Filipino mothers who proved the fathers of their children were Japanese. It affirmed the Tokyo District Court judgment that ""the marital status of the parents had no bearing on nationality, and that denying the children citizenship violated constitutional guarantees of equality for all."" Mel Nuqui, executive director of the Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), stated that ""the 30-year migration of Filipino entertainers to Japan produced 100,000 Japanese-Filipino children, but very few children were legally acknowledged by their Japanese fathers. DAWN assists Filipino entertainers and Japanese-Filipinos, by helping Japanese-Filipinos locate their fathers in Japan. In 2007, it called for registration of Japanese-Filipinos, and 1,313 Japanese-Filipinos in the Philippines registered (August to October in 2007). However, only 60 of the 1,313 children had been registered in Japan, and of 2,800 children (born out of wedlock from foreign mothers who reside in Japan), 2,000 had Japanese fathers. "
wikipedia-1266215," The Morning Post  The Morning Post, as the paper was named on its masthead, was a conservative daily newspaper published in London from 1772 to 1937, when it was acquired by ""The Daily Telegraph"". History. The paper was founded by John Bell. Originally a Whig paper, it was purchased by Daniel Stuart in 1795, who made it into a moderate Tory organ. A number of well-known writers contributed, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, James Mackintosh, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. In the seven years of Stuart's proprietorship, the paper's circulation rose from 350 to over 4,000. From 1803 until his death in 1833 or 1835, the owner and editor of the ""Post"" was Nicholas Byrne; his son William Pitt Byrne later held these roles. Later the paper was acquired by a Lancashire papermaker named Crompton. In 1848 he hired Peter Borthwick, a Scot who had been a Conservative MP for Evesham 1835-1847, as editor. When Peter died in 1852, his son Algernon took over. During the 1850s, the ""Post"" was very closely associated with the Palmerston ministry. With the aid of Andrew Montagu, Borthwick purchased the ""Post"" in 1876. His son Oliver (1873–1905) was business manager and editor, but died young, and upon the father's death in 1908 control went to his daughter Lilias Borthwick (1871–1965), wife of Seymour Henry Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst (1864–1943). The paper was noted for its attentions to the activities of the powerful and wealthy, its interest in foreign affairs, and in literary and artistic events. It began regular printing of notices of plays, concerts, and operas in the early 20th century, and is said to have been the first daily paper in London to do this. In 1881, it appointed the first woman war correspondent when it sent Lady Florence Dixie to South Africa to cover the First Boer War. Beginning in 1900, the Australian politician Alfred Deakin wrote anonymous commentaries on Australian politics for the paper, continuing even when he had become Prime Minister. Maurice Baring was a foreign correspondent for the paper, reporting from Manchuria, Russia and Constantinople between 1904 and 1909. He was war correspondent with Russian forces during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). Howell Arthur Gwynne took over as editor in 1911. The paper invited the ire of the Liberals in 1919 when it organised a collection for a purse of £18,000 to be presented to Reginald Dyer, the general of the Amritsar massacre for his services to the British Empire on his return to Britain. The Cause of World Unrest. The paper gained notoriety in 1920 when it ran a series of 17 or 18 articles based on the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"", text previously published in Russian by Sergei Nilus as the last chapter, ""Chapter XII"", of ""Velikoe v malom..."" ""(The Great in the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth)"". It is still widely held that Victor E. Marsden, the paper's Russian desk correspondent, used the copy of this rare book retained by the British Museum to translate this last chapter for the paper. Some have questioned this because the anonymous 1923 publication crediting Marsden as the translator in the pamphlet's preface occurred three years after Marsden's death on October 28, 1920. These articles were subsequently collected and formed the basis of the book, ""The Cause of World Unrest"", to which half the paper's staff contributed, mainly George Shanks; also Nesta H. Webster. But main credit for the compilation was given to the paper's editor, Gwynne. The book further denounced international Jewry and cultural and social dissolution among the Christian Nations. Final years. The Bathursts sold the paper to a consortium headed by the Duke of Northumberland in 1924. In 1937, the ""Morning Post"" was sold to the ""Daily Telegraph"", which was owned by William Berry. The Post did not remain a separate title and it was absorbed into the Telegraph. "
wikipedia-1266232," Stock Car Brasil  Stock Car Brasil, also known as Stock Car V8, is a touring car auto racing series based in Brazil. It is considered to be one of the major South American motorsports series. History. 1970s. The series was created in 1979 to be an alternative to the former Division 1 championship that competed with Chevrolet Opala and Ford Maverick. The dominance of Chevrolet over Ford models was causing a lack of public interest and sponsors. General Motors then created a new category, with a name reminiscent of the famous NASCAR with standardized performance and improvements for all the competitors. The first race was run on April 22, 1979 at the Autódromo Internacional de Tarumã, Rio Grande do Sul with 19 cars competing, all of them 6-cylinder Chevrolet Opalas. The pole position was held by José Carlos Palhares, and the race was won by Affonso Giaffone. 1980s. This decade saw the emergence of several rivalries between drivers. In 1982 two races were held for the first time at the Autodromo do Estoril, Portugal. The first major change in the Stock Car standard occurred in 1987. With the support of General Motors, a fairing designed and built by coachbuilder Caio was adopted, which was adapted to the Opala's chassis. The car exhibited improved aerodynamics and performance. Safety equipment become more sophisticated. 1990s. In 1990 General Motors renewed its interest in the category and built a prototype intended to replace the Caio/Hidroplas model.  In 1991 new rules were established and the races were disputed in double rounds on the weekends, with two drivers per car, but the series continued to lose ground with the public, sponsors and television networks to other championships with many manufacturers involved, such as Campeonato Brasileiro de Marcas e Pilotos that included the involvement of Chevrolet, Fiat, Ford and Volkswagen, as well as the always popular Formula racing championships.  In 1994 the championship returned to the old rules and Chevrolet announced that the Chevrolet Omega would be introduced as the new standard model. As part of a marketing strategy and in order to reduce costs, the tickets were free and the races were now held in double rounds sponsored by Brazilian Formula Chevrolet in an event called ""Chevrolet Challenger"". This decade marked a dominant era for Ingo Hoffmann with eight titles, three in partnership with Ângelo Giombell. His only serious challenges came from Paulo Gomes in 1995 and Chico Serra in 1999. 2000s. From 2000 on, General Motors departed the series and Vicar Promoções Desportivas, owned by former racing driver Carlos Col, took over the organization. This ushered in a period of modernization and improved security as the category started to use a tubular chassis designated JL G-09. The project engineer was Edgardo Fernandez, who did something similar for the Argentina category Top Race V6, inspired by both NASCAR and the DTM. The chassis was built by Zeca Giaffone's JL Racing. In 2003 the category replaced the Chevrolet 4-cylinder engine used with modifications since 1979 with a Chevrolet V8 imported from the United States by JL Racing, similar to the engines used by the NASCAR Busch Series. General Motors participated in the series with the Vectra. In 2005 Mitsubishi entered the series with the Mitsubishi Lancer. October 30 of that same year marked the first race held in Argentina at Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez, alongside the TC 2000 category. Attendance was 70,000. Giuliano Losacco was the winner, with Mateus Greipel second and Luciano Burti coming in third. In 2006, Volkswagen entered in the series with the Bora and the championship adopted a point system similar to the one used in NASCAR, as well as a new system with 16 teams and 32 drivers. At the end of the season, the 10 best drivers were automatically qualified to run the 4 final races, called ""Super Final"", similar to the Chase for the Sprint Cup. In 2007, the category gained another manufacturer with the entrance of Peugeot with its 307 Sedan. Volkswagen announced it was withdrawing from the category in 2008, with two-time champion Mitsubishi doing the same one year later. 2010s. For 2010 the category will use ethanol as fuel and engines with electronic injection.  In 2011, Peugeot re-entered the championship announced with the 408 sedan model, replacing the 307. In 2012, Chevrolet introduced the Chevrolet Sonic as its competing model. The category announced changes for 2012 season, dropping the ""Super Final"" system. The scoring system was also changed, with the top twenty drivers in each race being awarded points. Support races. Created in 1992, the ""Brazilian Formula Chevrolet"" was the Series' main support category. It used the same chassis as Formula Opel until 1994, subsequently switching to a Techspeed chassis until 2002, which was the same year the category was retired.

wikipedia-1266244," Genealogies of Genesis  The genealogies of Genesis (in chapters 4, 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis) record the descendants of Adam and Eve to Abraham, including the age at which each patriarch fathered his named son and the number of years he lived thereafter. The genealogy contains two branches: for Cain, given in Chapter 4, and for Seth in Chapter 5. Genesis chapter 10, the Table of Nations records the populating of the Earth by Noah's descendants, and is not strictly a genealogy but an ethnography). Enumerated genealogy. Three versions of the Genesis genealogy exist: the Hebrew Masoretic Text, the Greek Septuagint, and the Hebrew Samaritan Pentateuch. Translations from the Masoretic Text are preferred by Western Christians, including Roman Catholics and Protestants and by followers of Orthodox Judaism, whereas the Greek version is preferred by Eastern Christians, including Eastern Orthodox, Coptic, Ethiopic, Jacobite and Armenian. The Samaritan version of the Pentateuch is used mainly by the Samaritans. The Vulgate, published by Jerome in 405, is a Latin translation based on a Hebrew Tanakh compiled near the end of the first century, whereas the Septuagint was reportedly written by seventy translators in Egypt near the middle of the third century BC based on an earlier version of the Tanakh. Both of these translations have, like the Masoretic Text, been the basis for translations into numerous vernacular languages.  Genealogies of Cain and Seth. Three of Adam and Eve's children are named. The main genealogy is via Seth, who was born after Cain, the firstborn son, slew his brother Abel. A genealogy for Cain is also given (in ), with some names similar to those for Seth's descendants. No years are provided, so the following table simply lines the descendants up by generation. ""(for a continuation of this family tree through the line of Shem, see Abraham's Family Tree)"" Genesis numbers. Nearly all modern translations of Genesis are derived from the Masoretic (Hebrew) Text. But there are also two other versions of Genesis: the Samaritan (from a Hebrew script) and the Septuagint (a Greek translation of a Hebrew text). Although, scholars are aware that these three versions of Genesis 5 have different numbers, people who have seen only the commonly available translations are often unaware that other versions exist. The numbers in the Masoretic, Samaritan, and Lucianic Septuagint versions of Genesis are shown in this table: The following table lists the patriarchs that appear in the Vulgate and the Septuagint, but their names are spelled as they appear in the King James Version of the Bible. Their year of birth differs according to the Vulgate or the Septuagint. (AM = ""Anno Mundi"" = in the year of the world). Also given is each patriarch's age at the birth of his named son and the age of the patriarch's death. Cainan, born after the flood is mentioned in the Septuagint but not the Vulgate. Methuselah survived the Flood according to the Septuagint (but not the Vulgate), even though he was not on Noah's Ark. Nearly all modern translations of Genesis are derived from the Masoretic (Hebrew) Text. But there are also two other versions of Genesis: the Samaritan (in an early Hebrew script) and the Septuagint (a Greek translation of an early Hebrew text). Although, scholars are aware that these three versions of have different numbers, people who have seen only the commonly available translations are often unaware that other versions exist. The numbers in the Masoretic, Samaritan, and Lucianic Septuagint versions of Genesis 5 are shown in this table: ¹According to most interpretations, including the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews, Enoch did not die, but was taken away by God (at an age of 365). Genesis states that Enoch """"walked with God; and he was not; for God took him."""" Differences in the Genesis 5 numbers. A comparison of the Genesis 5 numbers (Adam through Noah) in the above table shows that the ages when the sons were born plus the remainders equal the totals given in each version, but each version uses different numbers to arrive at these totals. The three versions agree on some of the total ages at death, but many of the other numbers differ by exactly 100. The Septuagint numbers for the ages of the fathers at the birth of their sons, are in many instances 100 greater than the corresponding numbers in the other two versions.  The Samaritan chronology has Jared and Methuselah dying in Noah's 600th year, the year of the Flood. The Masoretic chronology also has Methuselah dying in Noah’s 600th year, but the Masoretic version uses a different chronology than the Samaritan version. The Lucianic text of the Septuagint has Methuselah surviving the Flood and therefore the 100 year differences were not an attempt by the Septuagint editors to have Jared, Methuselah, or Lamech die during or prior to the Flood. Some scholars argue that the differences between the Masoretic and Septuagint chronologies in Genesis 5 can be explained as alterations designed to rationalize a primary Masoretic system of chronology to a later Septuagint system. According to another scholar, to assume that the Masoretic Text is primary ""is a mere convention for the scholarly world"" and ""it should not be postulated in advance that MT reflects the original text of the biblical books better than the other texts."" Some commentators argue that the Genesis 5 numbers were intended to be read at face value, as solar years and not months, because attempts to rationalize the numbers by translating ""years"" as ""months"" results in some of the Genesis 5 people fathering children when they were five years old (if the Masoretic chronology is assumed to be primary). The scholarly translation of the Hebrew Pentateuch into Greek at Alexandria, Egypt in about 280 BC worked off a Hebrew text that was edited in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. This would be centuries older than the proto–Masoretic Text selected as the official text by the Masoretes. "
wikipedia-1266253," Battle of Aughrim  The Battle of Aughrim () was the decisive battle of the Williamite War in Ireland. It was fought between the Jacobites and the forces of William III on 12 July 1691 (old style, equivalent to 22 July new style), near the village of Aughrim in County Galway. The battle was one of the more bloody recorded fought on Irish soil – over 7,000 people were killed. It meant the effective end of Jacobitism in Ireland, although the city of Limerick held out until the autumn of 1691. The campaign. The Jacobite position in the summer of 1691 was a defensive one. In the previous year, they had retreated behind the River Shannon, which acted as an enormous moat around the province of Connacht, with strongholds at Sligo, Athlone and Limerick guarding the routes into Connacht. From this position, the Jacobites hoped to receive military aid from Louis XIV of France via the port towns and eventually be in a position to re-take the rest of Ireland. Godert de Ginkell, the Williamites' Dutch general, had breached this line of defence by crossing the Shannon at Athlone - taking the town after a bloody siege. The Marquis de St Ruth (General Charles Chalmont), the French Jacobite general, moved too slowly to save Athlone, as he had to gather his troops from their quarters and raise new ones from rapparee bands and the levies of Irish landowners. Ginkel marched through Ballinasloe, on the main road towards Limerick and Galway, before he found his way blocked by St Ruth’s army at Aughrim on the 12th of July 1691. Both armies were about 20,000 men strong. The soldiers of St Ruth’s army were mostly Irish Catholic, while Ginkel's were English, Scottish, Danish, Dutch and French Huguenot (members of William III’s League of Augsburg) and Irish Protestants. The Jacobite position at Aughrim was quite strong. St Ruth had drawn up his infantry along the crest of a ridge known as Kilcommadan Hill. The hill was lined with small stone walls and hedgerows which marked the boundaries of farmers' fields, but which could also be improved and then used as earthworks for the Jacobite infantry to shelter behind. The left of the position was bounded by a bog, through which there was only one causeway, overlooked by Aughrim village and a ruined castle. On the other, open, flank, St Ruth placed his best infantry under his second-in-command, the chevalier de Tessé, and most of his cavalry under Patrick Sarsfield. The battle. The battle started with Ginkel trying to assault the open flank of the Jacobite position with cavalry and infantry. This attack ground to a halt after determined Jacobite counter-attacks and the Williamites halted and dug in behind stakes driven into the ground to protect against cavalry. The French Huguenot forces committed here found themselves in low ground exposed to Jacobite fire and took a great number of casualties. Contemporaneous accounts speak of the grass being slippery with blood. To this day, this area on the south flank of the battle is known locally as the ""Bloody Hollow"". In the centre, the Williamite infantry under Hugh Mackay tried a frontal assault on the Jacobite infantry on Kilcommadan Hill. The Williamite troops, mainly English and Scots, had to take each line of trenches, only to find that the Irish had fallen back and were firing at them from the next line. The Williamite infantry attempted three assaults, the first of which penetrated furthest. Eventually, the final Williamite assault was driven back with heavy losses by cavalry and pursued into the bog, where more of them were killed or drowned. In the rout, the pursuing Jacobites manage to spike a battery of Williamite guns.  This left Ginkel with only one option, to try to force a way through the causeway on the Jacobite left. This should have been an impregnable position, with the attackers concentrated into a narrow lane and covered by the defenders of the castle there. However, the Irish troops there were short on ammunition. Mackay directed this fourth assault, consisting mainly of cavalry, in two groups - one along the causeway and one parallel to the south. The Jacobites stalled this attack with heavy fire from the castle, but then found that their reserve ammunition, which was British-made, would not fit into the muzzles of their French-supplied muskets. The Williamites then charged again with a reasonably fresh regiment of Anglo-Dutch cavalry under Henri de Massue. Faced with only weak musket fire, they crossed the causeway and reached Aughrim village with few casualties. A force of Jacobite cavalry under Henry Luttrell had been held in reserve to cover this flank. However, rather than counterattacking at this point, their commander ordered them to withdraw, following a route now known locally as ""Luttrell's Pass"". Henry Luttrell was alleged to have been in the pay of the Williamites and was assassinated in Dublin after the war. The castle quickly fell and its Jacobite garrison surrendered. "" fire from the castle on the right. . . was insignificant for it slew but a few in the passage. The reason of it was given because the men had French pieces, the bore of which was small and had English ball which was too large."" The Jacobite general Marquis de St Ruth, after the third infantry rush on the Williamite position up to their cannons, appeared to believe that the battle could be won and was heard to shout, ""they are running, we will chase them back to the gates of Dublin"". However, as he tried to rally his cavalry on the left to counter-attack and drive the Williamite horse back, he was decapitated by a cannon ball. At this point, the Jacobite position collapsed very quickly. Their horsemen, demoralised by the death of their commander, fled the battlefield, leaving the left flank open for the Williamites to funnel more troops into and envelope the Jacobite line. The Jacobites on the right, seeing the situation was hopeless, also began to melt away, although Sarsfield did try to organise a rearguard action. This left the Jacobite infantry on Killcommadan Hill completely exposed and surrounded. They were slaughtered by the Williamite cavalry as they tried to get away, many of them having thrown away their weapons in order to run faster. One eyewitness, George Storey, said that bodies covered the hill and looked from a distance like a flock of sheep. Aftermath. Estimates of the two armies' losses vary. It is generally agreed that about 7,000 men were killed at the battle. Some recent studies put the Williamite dead as high as 3,000, but they are more generally given as between 1-2,000, with 4,000 Jacobites killed. However the Williamite death toll released by them at the time was only 600 and they claimed to have killed fully 7,000 Jacobites. Many of the Jacobite dead were officers, who were very difficult to replace. On top of that, another 4,000 Jacobites either deserted or were taken prisoner. What was more, they had lost the better part of their equipment and supplies.  For these reasons, Aughrim was the decisive battle of the Williamite war in Ireland. The city of Galway surrendered without a fight after the battle, on advantageous terms, and the Jacobites' main army surrendered shortly afterward at Limerick after a short siege. The battle, according to one author, ""seared into Irish consciousness"", and became known in the Irish language tradition as ""Eachdhroim an áir"" - ""Aughrim of the slaughter"". The contemporary Gaelic poet Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta wrote of the Irish dead, ""It is at Aughrim of the slaughter where they are to be found, their damp bones lying uncoffined"". Another poet wrote, ""Our friends in vast numbers and languishing forms, left lifeless in the mountains and corroded by worms"". Since it marked the end of the Irish Catholic Jacobite resistance, Aughrim was the focus of Loyalist (particularly Orange Order) celebrations in Ireland on 12 July up until the early 19th century. Thereafter, it was superseded by the Battle of the Boyne in commemorations on ""the Twelfth"" due to the switch to the Gregorian calendar (in which 1 July OS became 11 July NS and 12 July OS became 22 July NS). It has also been suggested that the Boyne was preferred because the Irish troops there were more easily presented as cowardly than at Aughrim, where they generally fought bravely.  The Aughrim battlefield site became the subject of controversy in Ireland over plans to build the new M6 motorway through the former battlefield. Historians, environmentalists and members of the Orange Order objected to the destruction of the 1691 battlefield. The motorway opened in 2009. "

Allen was forced into starting just four games into his rookie season when Mark Tuinei suffered back spasms on the road against the Washington Redskins. He received the game ball for helping keep the Redskins sackless for the game. He recorded his first NFL start at left tackle, replacing an injured (Mark) Tuinei against the Arizona Cardinals. This marked the first time a rookie offensive lineman had started for Dallas since November 24, 1991 when Erik Williams started at right tackle against the Redskins. Allen returned to a back-up role for the next two weeks, but early in the morning on October 24, (Erik) Williams was injured in automobile accident and was out for the rest of the season.

For the third consecutive season behind Allen, Emmitt Smith ran for over 1,200 yards while passing 100 rushing yards four times, including a season-high 155 yards and three touchdowns against the Redskins on November 28. In 1997, Allen, despite being moved between guard and tackle during the season, was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl at guard and earned first-team All-Pro honors. He also spent part of training camp working at left tackle and returned to his right guard position for the first 13 games of season. He started his third season at right guard at Pittsburgh and helped Dallas gain 380 total yards, including 295 passing yards while not allowing a sack. He left the September 15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles after suffering a strained left hamstring in the second quarter and did not return. He returned to the starting lineup following the bye week against the Chicago Bears on September 28, but was forced to leave in the second quarter without enough strength in his left leg to block effectively. He was once again back in the starting lineup the following week at the Giants. He was then forced to move out to left tackle after the loss of Mark Tuinei in Washington on October 13. Allen remained at left tackle in third down passing situations against the Eagles and Redskins on October 26 and November 16. He became a full-time starter at left tackle against the upstart Carolina Panthers on December 8, and remained there the final three weeks of the season. In 1998, Allen was slated to start at the left tackle position from day one of the season after starting final three games of 1997 at left tackle. In his first full season guarding Troy Aikman’s blindside, he earned consensus All-Pro and All-NFC honors. He became just the third player in league history to be selected to the Pro Bowl at more than one offensive line position when peers voted him to NFC Pro Bowl team at tackle. He earned recognition as part of an offensive line that allowed just 19 sacks for 110 yards in 493 pass plays for a season, the fewest in NFL.

wikipedia-1266316," Dear Boss letter  The ""Dear Boss"" letter was a message allegedly written by the notorious Victorian serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. It was postmarked and received on 27 September 1888, by the Central News Agency of London. It was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September. The message, like most alleged Ripper letters that followed, contains a number of spelling and punctuation errors. It reads: Initially this letter was considered to be just one of many hoaxes, but when the body of Catherine Eddowes was found with one earlobe severed on 30 September, the writer's promise to ""clip the ladys ears off"" attracted attention. The Metropolitan Police published handbills with facsimiles of it and the Saucy Jacky postcard (which had referred to the earlier message and was received before the first became public knowledge) hoping someone would recognize the handwriting, but nothing came of this effort. Many newspapers also reprinted the text in whole or in part. These two messages gained worldwide notoriety after their publication. It was the first time the ""Jack the Ripper"" name had been used to refer to the killer, and the term captured the imagination of the public. Soon hundreds of other letters claiming to be from ""Jack the Ripper"" were received, most copying key phrases from these letters. After the murders, police officials stated that they believed this letter and the postcard were hoaxes by a local journalist. These suspicions were not well publicized, and the idea that the killer had sent messages taunting the police became one of the enduring legends of the Ripper case. Modern scholars are divided on which, if any, of the letters should be considered genuine, but the ""Dear Boss"" letter is one of three named most frequently as potentially having been written by the killer. A number of authors try to advance their theories by comparing handwriting samples of their suspects to the writing found in this letter. Like many items related to the Ripper case, the ""Dear Boss"" letter disappeared from the police files not long after the investigation ended. It may have been kept as a souvenir by one of the investigating officers. It was returned anonymously to the Metropolitan Police in 1987, whereupon Scotland Yard recalled all the documents from their file from the Public Record Office, now The National Archives, at Kew. The return of the documents was announced in 1988. "
wikipedia-1266333," Niavaran Palace Complex  Niavaran Palace Complex () is a historical complex situated in the northern part of Tehran, Iran. It consists of several buildings and a museum. The Sahebqraniyeh Palace, from the time of Naser al-Din Shah of Qajar dynasty, is also inside this complex. The main Niavaran Palace, completed in 1968, was the primary residence of the last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the Imperial family until the Iranian Revolution. The main palace was designed by the Iranian architect Mohsen Foroughi. History. The Niavarān Palace Complex traces its origin to a garden in Niavaran, Tehran, that was used by Nasir edin Shah(16 July 1831 – 1 May 1896) as a summer residence. The palace erected by Nasir al-Din Shah in this garden was originally referred to as""The Niavarān Palace"" and was later renamed ""The Sahebqraniyeh Palace"". During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi all the peripheral buildings of The Sahebqraniyeh Palace, with the exception of ""The Ahmad-Shahi Pavilion"" (or ""Kushk-e Ahmad-Shahi""), were demolished and the buildings and the structures of the present-day Niavarān Palace Complex were built to the north of ""The Sahebqraniyeh Palace"". In this period, ""The Ahmad-Shahi Pavilion"" served as an exhibition area of the presents of the world leaders to Iran. "
wikipedia-1266342," Superwoman  Superwoman is the name given to several fictional characters published over the years by DC Comics, most of them being, like the popular Supergirl, a woman with powers similar to those of DC's highly popular Superman. The name ""Superwoman"" was originally copyrighted by ""Detective Comics"" in an effort to prevent competitors from using it. As was the practice, an ashcan copy was created with the title of ""Superwoman"". The cover was a reproduction of ""More Fun Comics"" with the interior content being a reprint of the third issue. The first true appearance of Superwoman, which is usually thought to have been one of many trial runs for the future introduction of Kara Zor-El as Supergirl years later, was printed in ""Action Comics"". Versions. Lois Lane. The first appearance of the name ""Superwoman"" in a DC comic was a story in ""Action Comics"" where Lois Lane dreams that she has gained superpowers from a blood transfusion from Superman and launches a career as Superwoman. The theme would be revisited in a 1947 ""Superman"" comic in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a ""spell"" on Lane, making her believe she has superpowers. Superman is forced to play along with the ruse for a time, using super-speed to invisibly intervene in Lane's adventures, supporting the illusion. She briefly sports a costume modeled on Superman's before the spell is ""broken"". A story from ""Action Comics"" has Lois actually gaining superpowers thanks to one of Lex Luthor's inventions, and launches a short-lived career as ""Superwoman."" Later stories would sporadically feature tales in which Lois gained superpowers and functioned as a ""Superwoman"" of sorts, but all of these were, like the 1951 tale above, only temporary, with the powers wearing off by the end of the story. A typical example of this is ""The Turnabout Powers"" from ""Superman Family"", where the Earth-Two Lois Lane gained powers from her husband (the Earth-Two Superman) through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant Superman had brought into their home. The plant's death reversed the effect. Another example would be in the ""Batman/Superman: World's Finest"" mini-series where Mr. Mxyzptlk briefly transformed Lois into a ""Superwoman"" with costume and powers. At the end of ""All-Star Superman"" #2, Lois Lane is presented with a formula called ""Exo-Genes"" created by Superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours, and she became Superwoman. During her adventures with her new Kryptonian powers, she was wooed by two superhumans named ""Samson"" and ""Atlas"", and was captured by a time-Ultrasphinx. Her powers faded away at the end of the day. Notably, her costume seemed to be exactly the same as that of the Anti-Matter Universe's Superwoman (see below), but in Superman's colors. Both outfits were designed by Frank Quitely. Luma Lynai. A woman from the distant planet of Staryl, Luma Lynai wins the heart of Superman. Just as Superman derives his powers from a yellow sun, Lumisa derived her gifts of super-strength and flight from an orange sun. Their romance doesn't last, as Luma becomes deathly ill under the rays of a yellow sun, and Superman can't leave Earth undefended. She physically resembles an adult Kara Zor-El, with a similar costume, except instead of being blue-and-red with a pentagonal S shield, Luma's costume is white-and-green with a circular S emblem. Crime Syndicate of America. Earth-Three. In 1964, an evil counterpart of Wonder Woman from a parallel universe named ""Superwoman"" was introduced. This Superwoman was a member of the Crime Syndicate of America, a villainous counterpart of the Justice League of America from the parallel world of ""Earth-Three"" (vs. the Justice League's world of ""Earth-One""). Superwoman, like Wonder Woman, was an Amazon, and possessed similar powers of super-strength and flight. Unlike most/all other versions, her golden lasso could change shape into any form she desired, including a giant winged serpent. The Crime Syndicate first came to Earth-One when they felt they were becoming too soft as they were receiving no real challenge to their powers and Ultraman discovered Earth-One after gaining the power to gaze between worlds after exposure to a hunk of Kryptonite. Wonder Woman defeated Superwoman on Earth-1, Black Canary defeated her on Earth-2 and tied her up in her lasso, but like the other JSA members was transported to Earth-3 when she says she won due to a vibratory force Power Ring had placed in their bodies, and in the showdown on Earth-2 Superwoman was defeated again by Wonder Woman making her grasp both lassos, meaning she couldn't control them and was knocked out by her foe. The Crime Syndicate were defeated and imprisoned between Earth-One and Two by Green Lantern in a green bubble. Later the Crime Syndicate were freed by the time travelling villain Per Degaton after he was caught up in a time-storm, discovered their bubble, and freed them. They tried to get him, but he revealed he had made sure he and his Time Machine would vibrate at a different speed to them, meaning they couldn't touch him. They helped him change history and conquer Earth-2 by stealing nuclear missiles from the Cuban Missile crisis of Earth-Prime, and when the Syndicate betray him they are sent to 1982 of Earth-1, as he had made sure this would happen when they touched him. They materialised on the JLA's satellite headquarters, and defeated the heroes. The JSA were imprisoned in their prison, but the combined powers of Starman and Doctor Fate got them out. They helped him again when the JLA tried to restore history, though were planning to betray him. When Degaton was defeated this timeline was erased and the Syndicate was re-imprisoned. The Pre-""Crisis"" version of Superwoman was killed, along with the rest of the CSA, when they were trying to save Earth-Three from being destroyed by the Anti-Monitor's antimatter wave. Antimatter Earth. In Post-""Crisis"" continuity, as established in the 1998 graphic novel """" by Grant Morrison, Superwoman (and the rest of the Crime Syndicate) comes from a parallel world similar to Earth, but located in an antimatter universe (also home to the planet Qward). Superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the Crime Syndicate, most recently appearing in storylines in the ""Justice League"" and ""Superman"" comics. Unlike her pre-""Crisis"" counterpart, her magic lasso doesn't change shape, but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied with it (just as Wonder Woman's compels victims to tell the truth). She also possesses heat vision, as Superman and Ultraman do. Taking the alias Lois Lane, Superwoman is an Amazon by birth, and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the ""Daily Planet"" in what she calls ""Patriarch's World"". This disguise resembles Wonder Woman's secret identity of Diana Prince. At the Planet, Superwoman is shown to upset her colleagues; the antimatter-Cat Grant refers to Superwoman as ""Queen Bitch"", and negatively alludes to her ""friendship"" with the antimatter Jimmy Olsen. In her later appearances, it is stated that prior to taking on Lois Lane identity, Superwoman was born on Damnation Island, presumably the Antimatter counterpart to Themyscira (or ""Paradise Island""). It is mentioned that she had killed off all of her fellow Amazons, and upon meeting Donna Troy, she becomes ecstatic over the prospect of being able to kill another one of her kind for the first time in years. Jimmy Olsen is the only civilian who knows of Superwoman's secret identity. A compliant sexual deviant, he does what she tells him in exchange for the favour of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces of it for his ""disguise kit"". He is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults, even when she tauntingly refers to him as, ""Superwoman's Snitch, Jimmy Olsen,"" and prints it in the Planet. Also in the ""Earth 2"" story, her lover Ultraman hates Superwoman's frigidity towards him. Meanwhile, she is carrying on a torrid affair with Owlman, and they sneak trysts whenever they feel Ultraman is not watching. However, from his floating fortress (the antimatter counterpart to the Fortress of Solitude), Ultraman doesn't hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together. Earth-3. In ""52"" Week 52, a recreation of Earth-3 was shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original Justice Society of America, including Wonder Woman. The character is not identified in ""52"", but later in ""Countdown to Final Crisis"", which identifies her as Superwoman of the Crime Society of America, on an alternative world which is a reversed version of Earth-2. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions. Grant Morrison also suggests that the Earth-3 and Antimatter Superwomen both exist post-""52"". Like the antimatter iteration of the character, she is indeed both a Lois Lane and Wonder Woman counterpart, despite possessing Kryptonian abilities such as heat vision. In ""Countdown"", she is recruited into the Monarch's army but has her eyes gouged out by Red Robin (Jason Todd) of New Earth, who may or may not have been carrying Kryptonite. The New 52. In The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Superwoman is one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive from Earth-3 at the conclusion of the ""Trinity War"" event. During the ""Forever Evil"" storyline, Superwoman and Owlman raid Arkham Asylum where they end up capturing Nightwing. During the Crime Syndicate's broadcast, Superwoman reveals Nightwing's identity on the broadcast Mxyzptlk's Superwoman. In ""Superman"" #349 (""The Turnabout Trap!""), Superman returns from an interstellar mission to find that everyone on Earth is of opposite sex. Among them are Penny White (a female Perry White), Jenny Olsen (a female Jimmy Olsen), Louis Lane (a male Lois Lane), Batwoman (a female Batman, rather than the actual character), Wonder Warrior (a male Wonder Woman. DC comics could not use the name Wonder Man at the time because Marvel Comics holds the trademark and copyright. A later character did use the name Wonder Man however— see below.), Black Condor (a male Black Canary), Superlad (a male Supergirl), and Superwoman (his female counterpart) herself. Believing he crossed into a parallel universe, Superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal, but is blocked by an invisible barrier. He notices the parallelism fails when he sees Superwoman and Clara Kent (Superwoman's presumed secret identity) are two separate people.  When he confronts Superwoman he discovers that he is regarded as a super-villain in this gender-reversed world, which leads to a battle with Superwoman, Superlad, and Wonder Warrior. They manage to trap Superman with Wonder Warrior on guard, but he manages to escape and takes Wonder Warrior's magic lasso with him. Superman figures out that his foe Mr. Mxyzptlk is behind this gender-reversed world. This was partly due to the discrepancy of Clara Kent and Superwoman being different people. However, Mxyzptlk's biggest mistake was being too vain to give himself a reverse-gender counterpart in Superwoman's rogues gallery in The Daily Planet morgue; all of Superwoman's foes were reverse-gender counterparts to Superman's foes (Leslie Luthor (Lex Luthor), Bizaress (Bizarro) and the Toywoman (Toyman)) - except for Mxyzptlk. Superman discovers as well that he was never in a parallel universe, but rather on Earth, which Mxyzptlk had altered with his magic. After using Wonder Warrior's magic lasso to make Mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning to his native dimension, the effects of Mxyzptlk's magic (including the existence of Superwoman) vanish, returning the Earth to normal. Upon his return to his Clark Kent identity he is startled to discover there is still a Louis Lane, but he turns out to be Lois Lane's cousin. Laurel Kent. A new Superwoman named ""Laurel"", apparently a female version of Superman from a parallel Earth (now identified as Earth-11), appeared for the first time in ""Superman/Batman"", and was featured an issue later. In Earth 11's alternate universe, much like in the one featured in ""The Turnabout Trap!"", reversed-gender characters exist relative to those resident on New Earth: there is a Batwoman (female Batman), Superlad (male Supergirl), and a female Darkseid known as the ""Dark Queen"". (It is notable that in pre-Crisis continuity, ""Laurel Kent"" was the name of a 30th century descendant of Superman who occasionally appeared in stories featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, and was replaced in continuity by Laurel Gand.) In December 2007, Superwoman and Batwoman were featured in ""Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman"" #1. It features Earth-11 as part of the new DC Multiverse and presents a male version of Wonder Woman called Wonder Man, who originates from a society of male Amazons. It also depicts that world's version of ""Amazons Attack!"". Kristin Wells. Another version of Superwoman, this one a heroic character, came about in the form of Kristin Wells, who was created by Superman comic writer Elliot S! Maggin. Wells first appeared in Maggin's Superman novel ""Miracle Monday"", but he later introduced her in the pages of DC Comics Presents as Superwoman. The character Wells is a 29th-century descendant of Jimmy Olsen. Wells time travels to the 20th century, where the technology she had brought from the future gives her super powers. It is this iteration of the character which appears briefly in """". Dana Dearden. Obsessed Superman fan Dana Dearden dated Jimmy Olsen to get close to Superman, and when that didn't work she stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of Hercules, the speed (and flight) of Hermes, the thunderbolts of Zeus, and the sight of Heimdall. Dana donned a green-and-purple uniform, with ""Superwoman"" written down the leggings, and called herself Superwoman, and tried to get Superman to fall in love with her. He rejected her advances, and Jimmy called her Obsession. She vanished attempting to help Superman rescue people from a burning ship. When Superman was split into his Red and Blue energy forms, Superwoman returned hoping that one of the Supermen would return her feelings, but Maxima intervened, and used her telepathy to convince Superwoman that she would destroy Superman with her love. The telepathic illusion wore off and she would try to win Superman over again, this time in a red-and blue costume very similar to his, and claimed to be his wife in response to a recent photograph of Superman wearing a wedding ring. During a subsequent attack of humans using the DMN drug- which turned the users into violent demons until the 'high' was over-, Superman convinced her to help him stop the DMN users, arguing that, if she truly loved him, she would help him do his duty rather than attack him for potentially picking someone else over her. She died trying to protect him from one of the DMN users when it almost struck him in the back while he was distracted, since she knew he was vulnerable to magic. Lucy Lane. Lucy Lane first appeared as Superwoman in ""Supergirl"" (vol. 5) #35 (January 2009), her costume a nod to that of the Bronze Age Superwoman Kristin Wells and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. However, Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was blackmailed by her father, General Sam Lane, into performing acts of villainy such as killing Agent Liberty, who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor. (This resulted in her being the focus of the ""Supergirl"" Faces of Evil issue.) She later attacked Reactron, which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that that villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her). Supergirl unmasks Superwoman, and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode. In the Supergirl annual Lucy is brought back to life by the suit as it steals the life of another person. The suit is then revealed to be a magical creation of Mirabai of the Forlorn, ally of Sam Lane, who mystically infused in it the genetic abilities of several alien races of Kryptonian might: when Supergirl ruptured it, the backlash permanently altered Lucy Lane into being a composite alien being of human appearance herself, with inherent Kryptonian abilities. This Superwoman was last seen as a prisoner after Sam Lane's machinations during the War of the Supermen storyline came to an end, though it was hinted she would escape at some point in the future. However the launch of The New 52 has ended that storyline, and there is no indication of anyone in The New 52 line who has claimed the identity as of December 2012. Other uses. Various comic stories, pre- and post-Crisis, have offered glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of Supergirl would eventually change her codename to Superwoman upon reaching what she considered adulthood. One example is a 1980 issue of ""Superman Family"", in which all the stories are set in the then- near future 1999 or 2000 (the timeframe is cited only as ""the turn of the century"") with the characters aged appropriately, including an older Linda Danvers (Kara Zor-El) who divides her time between her career as Superwoman and serving as governor of Florida.  Alternatively, some stories assume one of Superman's female descendants would assume the name ""Superwoman"", like his daughter Kara and great-granddaughter Lara from the Elseworlds series, """".

wikipedia-1266347," Prodrive  Prodrive is an English motorsport and automotive engineering group based in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England. It designs, constructs and races cars for companies and teams such as Subaru, Aston Martin and Ford. Its automotive technology division provides road car design and engineering consultation for various car manufacturers as well as businesses in the defence, aerospace and marine industries. Prodrive is perhaps best known for its involvement in the World Rally Championship with the Subaru World Rally Team. While the Subaru World Rally programme ended in 2008, today its motorsport manufacturer programmes include Aston Martin Racing in world sportscar racing, Ford Performance Racing in the Australian V8 Supercar Series and the new Mini WRC Team. In Australia the company has an interest in Ford Performance Vehicles, a joint venture with Ford Australia which produces automobiles under the FPV brand. The group is also involved in activities in China. Globally, the company employs around 600 people and has a turnover of around £100 million. History. Prodrive was founded in 1984 by Ian Parry and David Richards, the latter is now the chairman of the group. Their first involvement in motorsport was with the Rothmans Porsche Rally Team running a Porsche 911 SC RS for Saed Al Hajri in the Middle East Rally Championship. In 1986, in addition to the Rothman's programme, Prodrive ran a MG Metro 6R4 in British and Irish rally championships. In 1987, they expanded into touring cars, running BMWs M3 in the British Touring Car Championship. They were the outright 1988 champions, and class champions in 1989 and 1990. Since then, Prodrive has run touring car programmes for Alfa Romeo (BTCC champions 1994) for Honda, for Ford (BTCC champions in 2000) and with Volvo in FIA European Touring Car Championship (ETCC). It currently runs the Ford Performance Racing team in Australia's equivalent touring car championship, the V8 Supercar Series. In 1990, Prodrive started rallying with Subaru, a relationship which lasted until December 2008, when the global economic downturn forced their withdrawal from World Rallying. During the near 20 year partnership, the team won three drivers' WRC titles for Colin McRae (1995), Richard Burns (2001) and Petter Solberg (2003), as well as three manufacturers' titles (1995,96,97). In the winter of 1998, the company were approached by Russian oil company Lukoil to enable them to enter motorsports sponsorship. As entries to Formula 3000 were restricted, Richards agreed a deal with family friend Christian Horner that Prodrive would take a 50% stake in Horner's Arden International, in return for Horner retiring from driving and becoming team manager. As a result Arden signed Viktor Maslov as a driver under the Lukoil deal from 1999. In 1999, investment group Apax Partners bought 49% of Prodrive. Horner hence exercised the option to buy back the Prodrive stake in Arden, although to this day Arden are based at and use premises rented from Prodrive. In 2007 Apax sold their investment in the business and in 2008, The Investment Dar company, based in Kuwait, acquired a share of the business. In 2000 Prodrive expanded out of its base in Banbury, UK and bought a private proving ground in Warwickshire to house its automotive technology business. In 2001 the company acquired Tickford and merged this automotive engineering business into its own operations. With Tickford came subsidiary businesses in North America and Australia. The businesses in North America were subsequently sold, while in Australia, the Tickford brand was replaced by the new Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) brand. FPV now designs and manufactures around 2000 high performance cars for the local market. In 2001, Prodrive entered sports car racing with its own privately developed Ferrari 550 GTS Maranello. Prodrive raced the car until 2004 winning numerous races in the FIA GT and American Le Mans Series. The highlight for the programme was GTS class victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2003. The success of this project led to a full works programme with Aston Martin and the creation of Aston Martin Racing in late 2004, a partnership between Prodrive and the British motor manufacturer. The team won on its debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2005 with its new DBR9 GT1 car. Aston Martin Racing subsequently competed in the American Le Mans Series and at Le Mans with the highlights of the programme being two GT1 class victories at Le Mans in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the team developed a new LMP1 car and won the 2009 Le Mans Series and was fourth at Le Mans and the fastest petrol powered car. This programme continues today. In December 2001 Prodrive was brought in to manage the unsuccessful Formula One constructor BAR. Richards was appointed as team principal of BAR. Under Prodrive management the team's fortunes were turned around and by the end of the 2004 season, the BAR Honda F1 team was second in the F1 manufacturers' championship. At that point the owners, BAT (British American Tobacco), sold the team to Honda. The Prodrive management contract was ended and Prodrive's managing director Nick Fry assumed the role of team principal. Prodrive has subsequently been linked with Formula One on a number of occasions since (see below for details). In March 2007 a consortium led by Prodrive chairman David Richards bought British sports car firm Aston Martin from Ford, bringing Aston Martin back into British control. Prodrive has no financial involvement in the deal. Richards himself is a long-time Aston Martin enthusiast, and owns an extensive collection of both modern and historic models. World Rally Championship. In 1990, Prodrive began a long standing and highly successful relationship with Subaru, forming the Subaru World Rally Team. Prodrive was tasked with running Subaru's rallying campaigns, helping them to three Drivers' and three Manufacturers' World Rally Championships (WRC). Starting out with the Subaru Legacy, they achieved minor success in the WRC with regular drivers Colin McRae and Ari Vatanen. The first Subaru victory in the WRC was by McRae in a Legacy during the 1993 Rally New Zealand. The smaller and more agile Impreza became the platform which Prodrive would be most successful within rally. Scotland’s Colin McRae won the 1995 World Rally Championship for drivers, followed later by England’s Richard Burns in 2001 and Norwegian Petter Solberg in 2003. All three championship Subarus were prepared and run by Prodrive. The distinctive blue with yellow colour scheme was a throwback to the early 1990s sponsorship deal with 555, a BAT cigarette brand popular in Asia. After a number of years of poor performances, Subaru announced their withdrawal from the WRC at the end of the 2008 season. On 27 July 2010, it was announced that Prodrive would re-entry the WRC with a limited program in 2011 with BMW using the MINI Countryman. A full season in 2012 is planned with the car which will be powered by a 1.6-litre, four-cylinder turbo-charged engine from BMW Motorsport. Formula One. On 28 April 2006, Prodrive were officially granted entry to F1 when the FIA announced the list of entrants to the 2008 Formula One World Championship. FIA president Max Mosley was impressed by Prodrive's bid, which beat off stiff competition from the likes of Carlin Motorsport, the Jean Alesi-led McLaren-supported Direxiv outfit, BAR co-founder Craig Pollock, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart and ex-Jordan Grand Prix team principal, Eddie Jordan. He revealed that Prodrive have found the finances to support their bid, adding: ""Prodrive has the best combination of financial backing, technical capability and motorsport experience. Also, Prodrive's chief executive, David Richards, has experience as a Formula One team principal"". Following a legal challenge by Williams to Prodrive's proposed use of a customer car David Richards announced on 23 November 2007 that Prodrive would not be entering Formula One for the 2008 season. Richards made it clear that it was still the intention of Prodrive to enter Formula One. However, following further clarifications of the rules surrounding the use of customer cars, and the resulting ban on the use of customer chassis from the beginning of the 2009 F1 season, the pursuit of an entry via the customer car route has been abandoned. Richards has previously stated that entry as an independent constructor would be prohibitively expensive. On 23 April 2009, Prodrive issued a press release stating that they were considering an F1 entry for the 2010 season. On 29 May 2009, it was reported that Prodrive had submitted a formal application for the 2010 season. Prodrive was one of two potential buyers considered by the Renault F1 Team to take-over the team prior to the 2010 season. In April 2010 Prodrive announced it would not apply for the 2011 Formula One season. The slot became available after US F1 Team collapsed. The Fulcrum. Prodrive already had a facility at the former RAF Honiley airfield and LucasVarity proving ground near Wroxall, Warwickshire, together with Marcos and TRW. In March 2006, Prodrive announced its intent to build a £200million, motorsport facility called The Fulcrum. Prodrive's statement in the planning application for the facility – which could house as many as 1,000 staff – boasted of ""a motorsport complex which could eventually house Prodrive's new British Prodrive F1 team"", further cementing Managing Director Richards' intention to return to F1 in 2008. Until the Honiley factory is operational, Prodrive will remain at their existing Banbury headquarters. As of 3 August 2006, Prodrive has won the support of the Warwick District Council planning committee for development of The Fulcrum. The permission covers a highly advanced engineering research and development campus, a conference facility called the ""Catalyst Centre"" and new access road, a roundabout, infrastructure, parking and landscaping. The plans still have to be presented and agreed by the British government's Department for Communities and Local Government, and there is local opposition via the Fulcrum Prodrive Action Group (FPAG) to protect the rural nature of the community and the safety of the people that live within it.

wikipedia-1266370," Pretty Vacant  ""Pretty Vacant"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Sex Pistols. It was released on 1 July 1977 as the band's third single and was later featured on their only album, ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols"", released that same year. The song marked the band's (then) only appearance on the British music show Top of the Pops, until 1996 when the original line-up performed the song (after the live version was released that year) as well as ""New York"" on the same showing. The song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word ""vacant"", emphasising the last syllable making it sound like the vulgar word ""cunt"". According to Glen Matlock, the song's main riff was inspired by ""S.O.S."" by ABBA after he heard it on the radio. The B-side is a cover of The Stooges' ""No Fun"", which the band played on the spot without a proper rehearsal. It was taken from demo sessions recorded by producer Dave Goodman. The band made a video of ""Pretty Vacant"" (as well as one for ""God Save the Queen"") on 11 & 12 July 1977 at the studios of ITN in Wells Street, London. They were thrown out after throwing cans of lager at the cameramen on the 11th but came back on the 12th to finish the recording. ""NME"" magazine made it their Single of the Year in 1977. In March 2005, ""Q"" magazine placed the song at number 26 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The album was reissued as a 2-CD set in 1992. A live version of the track from ""Filthy Lucre Live"" was released as a single in 1996, and a 7"" picture disc was released in 2012. Covers and samples. Joey Ramone used the lead riff in his cover of ""What a Wonderful World"". The song was used in the 1981 film ""American Pop"". South African pop group Shikisha released a cover version of the song in 1996. The French band Les Négresses Vertes as well as grime MC Lady Sovereign have both covered ""Pretty Vacant"" and performed live versions of the song. Lady Sovereign's version is featured in the popular TV show, ""The O.C."" and the cover version is featured on one of the six ""The O.C."" soundtracks called ""Music from The O.C.: Mix 6 – Covering Our Tracks"". Joan Jett released a cover version on single. ""Pretty Vacant"" was covered by Paul Jones in 1978. In 1996 Black Grape released cover version (very similar to an original) on their single ""Fat Neck"". An Irish language version of the song, entitled ""Folamh go Deas"" (a literal translation), was performed by Irish band Na Magairlí in 1981. The group The Ukrainians perform a Ukrainian language version of this song on their EP ""Anarchy In The UK"" and album ""Respublika"". "
wikipedia-1266372," R100  His Majesty's Airship R100, known simply as the R100, was a privately designed and built rigid British airship made as part of a two-ship competition to develop a commercial airship service for use on British Empire routes as part of the Imperial Airship Scheme. The other airship, the R101, was built by the British Air Ministry, but both airships were funded by the Government. The R100 was built by the Airship Guarantee Company, a specially-created subsidiary of the armaments firm, Vickers-Armstrongs, led by Commander Dennis Burney, with the design team headed by Barnes Wallis, later famous for his invention of the bouncing bomb. The design team also included Nevil Shute Norway as the senior stress engineer. The R100 first flew in November 1929. It made a series of trial flights and a successful return crossing of the Atlantic in July–August 1930, but following the crash of R101 in October 1930 the Imperial Airship Scheme was terminated and it was broken up for scrap. Background. The R100 was built as part of a British government programme to develop airships to provide passenger and mail transport between Britain and the countries of the British Empire, including India, Australia and Canada. This had its origin in Dennistoun Burney's 1922 proposal for a civil airship development programme to be subsidised by the Government and carried out by a specially established subsidiary of Vickers. When the General Election of 1923 brought Ramsay MacDonald’s Labour administration to power, the new Air Minister, Lord Thomson formulated the Imperial Airship Scheme in its place. This called for the building of two experimental airships: one, R101, to be designed and constructed under the direction of the Air Ministry, and the other, R100, to be built by the Vickers' subsidiary under a fixed price contract. Design and development. The R100 was constructed at the former RNAS Air Station Howden in Yorkshire, a remote location from Howden and from Hull. Design work began in 1925 while at the same time the somewhat rundown site was put in order and a hydrogen-generating plant installed. The specially established subsidiary of Vickers, the Airship Guarantee Company, faced substantial difficulties. The contract for R100's construction was a fixed price one and it was obvious from very early on that the project would incur a loss, and so economies were made; for instance, only a dozen machine tools were in use for construction of the airship. There were also difficulties in finding skilled workers due to the remoteness of the location, and a large proportion of the workers were local people who had to be trained. Conditions in the unheated airship shed were also poor: the roof leaked, ice formed on the girders in winter, and condensation caused corrosion of the airship's duralumin structure, so that the girders had to be varnished. For three years the actual assembly work was close behind that of the designers, and the progress of the design work was the determining factor in speed of construction. Airframe. Both R100 and R101 used a smaller number of longitudinal girders than previous airships in order to simplify stress calculations. Even so, the calculations for the transverse frames required hand computation that took two or three months to produce a solution for each frame. The thoroughness of the stressing calculations was a consequence of new Air Ministry criteria for the strengths required of airships, formulated in response to the catastrophic structural failure of R38 in 1921. However, fewer longitudinal girders resulted in larger unsupported panels of fabric in the envelope. Flight trials were to prove that the R100's covering was barely adequate. The envelope of R101 was also unsatisfactory, and a failure in its cover was possibly a cause of its crash. Barnes Wallis created the frame of the airship using only 11 standardized components. The 16 longitudinal girders were formed of three tubes each, formed from strips of Duralumin wound into a spiral and riveted together. These connected 15 polygonal transverse frames, which were held in shape by wire bracing connected to a central longitudinal girder running the length of the ship. A further consequence of the new rules for airframe stress design was that a new way of harnessing the lifting force of the gasbags had to be found. Wallis's solution to this problem later led to his innovative geodesic airframe fuselage and wing design for the Wellesley, Wellington and Windsor bombers. The elevators were aerodynamically balanced but the rudders were unbalanced. When the designers learned that R101 had been fitted with servo motors at a substantial cost in weight and money they thought that they had made a mistake and rechecked their calculations. They eventually concluded that their calculations had been correct: when R100 was flown the controls proved both light and effective, and its control characteristics were compared favorably with those of R101 by Nöel Atherstone, First Officer of the R101. The R100 was built suspended from the roof of its shed. The individual transverse frames were assembled horizontally then lifted up and slung from roof-mounted trackways before being slid into position and attached to the adjacent frames by the longitudinal girders. The ship remained suspended until the gasbags were inflated with hydrogen. By summer 1929 the ship's structure was nearly complete and her gasbags were inflated. Following inflation of the gasbags, the outer covering of linen fabric painted with aluminum aircraft dope was put in place, and she was completed at the beginning of November. Lift and trim trials were carried out on 11 November: empty weight was and gasbag volume was , giving a standard gross lift of and so a disposable lift of . Deducting for the service load (crew, stores and ballast) this meant the weight available for fuel and payload was . Propulsion. It had originally been intended to design special engines for R100 which would be fuelled by hydrogen and kerosene but after a years' work it was realized that the engine would not be developed in time and it was decided to fit the Beardmore Tornado diesel engine that was being developed for the Air Ministry for installation in R101. However at a very early stage the Tornado was judged unsuitable due to its weight and other problems. Wallis finally settled on the use of six reconditioned Rolls-Royce Condor petrol engines even though the fuel, with its lower flash point, was considered to be a fire risk under tropical conditions. The engines were contained in three gondolas, each with one engine driving a 17 ft (5.18 m) diameter tractor propeller and a second driving a 15 ft (4.57 m) diameter pusher propeller. The engines driving the pusher propellers were also fitted with a gearbox to provide reverse thrust for docking the airship. Passenger and crew accommodation. The passenger and crew accommodation were arranged on three decks occupying a single bay of the structure and entirely contained within the airship's envelope. The lower deck contained the crew accommodation. The second deck had a dining room, which doubled as the passenger lounge, plus the kitchen, 18 four-berth passenger cabins and a gallery on either side for passengers to enjoy the view through the windows built into the skin. The third deck consisted of a gallery running around the dining-room and 14 two-berth cabins. Operational history. First flights. R100 made her maiden flight in the morning of 16 December 1929. After departing Howden at 07.53, she flew slowly to York then set course for the Government Airship Establishment at Cardington, Bedfordshire, running on five engines since one of the engines had to be shut down due to a cracked water jacket, and completing the mooring process at 13.40.  A second flight was made the next day, with the intention of making a flight to London, but shortly after slipping the mast a strip of fabric became detached from the lower fin, and the flight was limited to a cruise around Bedfordshire to test control response, lasting 6hr 29 min. The following day R100 was taken from the mast to No.2 shed at Cardington and work on modifying the wiring holding the cover in place begun: this took until 11 January 1930. During a test on 16 January 1930, R100 achieved a speed of . At speed a problem with the outer covering became apparent: it tended to ripple and flap excessively in the form of a standing wave. Cine films were taken of this phenomenon which occurred due to the large areas of unsupported fabric; it is also clearly visible in some photographs. Transatlantic Voyage to Canada. The R100's contract originally called for a final acceptance trial flight of 48 hours duration and a demonstration flight to India. The decision to use petrol engines resulted in a change in destination to Canada, as it was considered that a flight to the tropics with petrol aboard would be too hazardous. Following a final acceptance trial of 54 hours, R100 was formally handed over to the Air Ministry, and a number of modifications were made in preparation for her transatlantic flight. During her last flight the tail fairing had collapsed due to aerodynamic pressures and her pointed tail was modified to a more rounded form, shortening her length by . Shortly before the R101's flights in June 1930, the Cardington engineers tentatively suggested that the long flights to Canada and India might be postponed until 1931 on the grounds that neither of the two airships was fit to make a lengthy flight at their current developmental stage. The R100 team replied that their airship was perfectly capable of flying to Canada, and furthermore the Canadian flight was a part of their contract. The R100 duly departed for Canada on 29 July 1930, reaching its mooring mast at the St-Hubert, Quebec Airport (outside of Montreal) in 78 hours, having covered the great circle route of at an average ground speed of . The airship stayed at Montreal for 12 days with over 100,000 people visiting the airship each day while she was moored there, and a song was composed by La Bolduc to commemorate, or rather to make fun of, the people's fascination with the R100. She also made a 24-hour passenger-carrying flight to Ottawa, Toronto, and Niagara Falls while in Canada. The airship departed on her return flight on 13 August, reaching Cardington after a 57½ hour flight. Nevil Shute later suggested in """" that the success of the R100's Canadian flight indirectly led to the R101 disaster. Prior to the transatlantic flight, the Cardington team could suggest that neither airship was ready for a performance of such duration. However when the R100 returned in triumph they had to either make the flight to India or admit defeat - which would have meant discredit with the consequent danger of losing their jobs. The end of the British airships. The tale of the design of R100 and its claimed superiority to R101 is told in Shute's ""Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer"", first published in 1954. Although flawed and not quite as overwhelmingly superior as Nevil Shute implied, the R100 represented the best that conventional airship technology in Britain had to offer at the time. The R101 suffered in comparison partly because of her many groundbreaking but ultimately problematic innovations, and also because of the weight of her diesel engines. In terms of lifting efficiency, both were inferior to the smaller LZ 127 ""Graf Zeppelin"". After the R101 crashed and burned in France, en route to India on 5 October 1930, the Air Ministry ordered R100 grounded. She was deflated and hung up in her shed at Cardington for a year whilst three options were considered: a complete refit of R100 and continuation of tests for the eventual construction of R102; static testing of R100 and retention of about 300 staff to keep the programme ""ticking over""; or retention of staff and the scrapping of the airship. In November 1931, it was decided to sell R100 for scrap. The entire framework of the ship was flattened by steamrollers and sold for less than £600. "

As part of the all-men Lopevi tribe, Chris endangered his position in the game in the first immunity challenge. Chris failed to cross the balance-beam in the challenge, which led to victory for the all-female Yasur tribe. Athletic members of the Lopevi tribe campaigned for Chris to be the first to go, but Chris managed to form an alliance of unathletic men, sometimes referred to as the ""Fat Five"", consisting of himself, Travis Sampson, Rory Freeman, Chad Crittenden and led by Lea ""Sarge"" Masters. This alliance controlled the numbers and targeted the younger players, voting out Brook Geraghty at the first tribal council. Lopevi won immunity in the second episode. In Episode 3, both tribes were informed they would be going to tribal council. When John Kenney won individual immunity, the ""Fat Five"" alliance targeted John Palyok and he was voted out. When Lopevi lost immunity in the next episode, the alliance once again got rid of another younger male, Brady Finta. In Episode 5, a tribal shuffle resulted in the ""Fat Five"" losing Travis and Rory to Yasur and gaining two women, Twila Tanner and Julie Berry. This new-Lopevi tribe managed to win the next two immunity challenges. This, however, meant the loss of Travis as the women of Yasur voted him out. When Lopevi lost immunity in Episode 7, Chris, Sarge and Chad recruited Twila and Julie to vote out the last younger male, John Kenney (who, in his farewell speech, expressed his desire to see Chris win the game). The two tribes merged into one, Alinta. Chris, Chad and Lea ""Sarge"" reunited with old ally Rory. This four-man alliance believed that Twila and Julie would side with them. However, Twila and Julie joined former allies Ami Cusack, Leann Slaby, Scout Cloud Lee and Eliza Orlins to vote off Rory, when Sarge won immunity. The 6-female alliance then targeted Sarge voting him out next, with even Chris casting a vote for him to let the women know he was a team player. The female alliance stuck together once again and voted out Chad over Chris.  At that point, it seemed like Chris' time in the game was over, as he was the only surviving male. However, his performance and determination in the immunity challenge caused Ami and her alliance to keep Chris around one more week and vote out tribal annoyance, Eliza. But Twila and Scout, not happy with their positions in the game, hatched a new plan. Together they approached Chris about a new alliance. Chris, Twila and Scout managed to lure in Eliza, the next target, and this new alliance successfully eliminated Ami's closest ally Leann. The cross-tribal alliance targeted Leann because Ami would not surrender immunity. Ami, knowing her days were numbered, tried to convince Eliza and Chris to join her and Julie in an alliance against Twila and Scout. While it seemed as though Eliza might defect, in the end she stayed strong and the four voted out Ami. Chris then struck a deal with Julie and Eliza to vote with them against Twila. However, at Tribal Council, Chris sided with Twila and Scout once again to vote out Julie instead, because she was too well liked by the female-dominated jury and because she had previously betrayed him at the merge by voting out Rory. In the ""final four"" finale, Chris again managed to convince Eliza that he was in an alliance with her, despite his obvious alliance with Twila and Scout. Chris decided she was too much of a risk and a flip-flopper, voting her out. Then Chris managed to win immunity, securing him a place in the final two. Comments by Scout at the challenge led Chris to believe that Twila would not have been true to him and their Final 2 pact had she won. Chris confronted Scout about the issue, and Scout said she didn't have a final two alliance with Twila, hoping Chris would pick her instead of Twila. Satisfied, Chris voted out Scout and chose Twila to join him in the final two.  In the end, Chris Daugherty beat out Twila Tanner in a 5-2 vote to become the Sole Survivor. He gained the votes of Lea ""Sarge"" Masters, Chad Crittenden, Leann Slaby, Julie Berry and Eliza Orlins and only lost the votes of Scout Cloud Lee and Ami Cusack. Many of his votes came from female jury members who were able to look past his gender and recognize his strong gameplay against the unpopular and controversial Twila, who he was well-aware had made many enemies in the game. Personal life. On Sunday, February 13, 2005, Daugherty married his fiancée Lorie Groves (who made a brief appearance on the show during the ""family visit"" segment) in Victory Lane at Daytona International Speedway.  Honorary best man for the couple was longtime NASCAR star Mark Martin. There were some cars practicing on the track, creating background noise. Martin said ""every time IROC cars came by, instead of that being an irritation them, that was exactly what they wanted.""  Chris agreed, ""You don't pass up an opportunity to get married at Daytona, especially in Victory Lane. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.""[http://www.realitytvworld.com/index/articles/story.php?s=3254] After his appearance on Survivor, Chris Daugherty returned to his home in South Vienna, Ohio, and his job at the Ohio Department of Transportation.In 2005, he asked for vacation time to participate in a European promotional tour for Survivor. Since Daugherty had no additional vacation time, he submitted a doctor's note that claimed Daugherty needed one month off from work due to anxiety and depression. He was suspended from work for twenty days without pay after investigators discovered it was an excuse to appear on Survivor related activities [http://www.celebrityspider.com/news/june06/article060506-12.html although after disputing the suspension, State of Ohio arbitrator declared Chris followed the Union contract and was reimbursed his pay for the twenty day suspension.

wikipedia-1274563," Technomage  The Technomages are a group of sentient beings from the fictional ""Babylon 5"" universe. The technomages shown in the television series are primarily human, but in the ""Technomage Trilogy"" books, apprentices and mages of other races including Centauri are named. They are described as using ""science to create the appearance of magic"". Galen, a Technomage, was a regular character on the spin-off series, ""Crusade"". Origins. In the ""Technomage Trilogy"" of ""Babylon 5"" novels, it is revealed that the technology in question consists of bio-technological implants, and that the process of installing the implants and adjusting to them is excruciatingly painful. The presence of these implants means that technomages are effectively cyborgs. Eventually it is also revealed that the technology was supplied by the Shadows who originally had plans to turn them into warriors of chaos and destruction. This was first done on the young of a race of similar age to the Minbari who were called the Taratimude, who eventually became extinct, but not before spreading the Technomage order to other races including humans. It appears that EarthForce black ops was attempting to create its own Technomages, which was to have been expressly spelled out in the final episode of the first season of Crusade, but as the show was canceled after only 13 episodes it was never filmed. Technomage powers. Technomages are shown to have many different powers over the course of both Babylon 5 and Crusade. Such powers include being able to cast a shield around their bodies to absorb damage or contain atmosphere in hostile environments, hurl fireballs, generate holograms, cloak themselves in invisibility, and establish real-time communication with another Technomage regardless of distance. Technomages may choose to establish a ""place of power"" for themselves, such as a particular planet. In doing so, they develop a strong connection with that place, and to some extent, a dependency on that connection. Through the course of the ""Technomage Trilogy"", Galen and Isabelle uncover several energetic, primal abilities that underlie the conventional mage abilities and relate to their connection with the Shadows. Isabelle discovered a spell that allows mages to intercept the communications sent to Shadow agents like Morden or the Drakh. The Primal Abilities of the Technomage Implants are as follows. Invisibility, Communion with the Shadows (""base"" for the Communication spell), Shadow Skin (a type of energy shield), Destruction Sphere (""base"" of the Fireball ""spell""), Healing, Access to ""Tech"" outside of the Mage, and a type of energy blast (Access to ""Inner Tech""). Galen stated these were the only ones he's discovered, bringing the ""Base"" or Primal spell count to seven. Characters. Notable Technomages who have appeared on screen and in novels include: Elric. The first Technomage character to appear onscreen. Played by Michael Ansara, Galen's teacher as well as a friend of his father, and one of the mage Elders as of 2259. When young Galen's technomage parents died in a starliner fire, Elric adopted Galen and began mentoring him as an apprentice. Elric was also the major technomage character from the original Babylon 5 series (appearing in the season 2 episode ""The Geometry of Shadows"") shown to be leading the Technomage order to a hiding place beyond the rim of the galaxy. Galen indicates later in Crusade (episode ""The Long Road"") that Elric died not long after reaching the hiding place, confirmed later in the Technomage Trilogy novels. Galen. Played by Peter Woodward, a major character appearing throughout the Babylon 5 spin-off series Crusade, and the most powerful of the current remaining technomages. With the exception of the Babylon 5 season 2 episode ""The Geometry of Shadows"", the technomage stories in the B5/Crusade universe tend to be focused around Galen. Galen has ""become one"" with his tech by discovering the technomages' Shadow legacy (a fact known only to a handful of technomages), learning how to interact with his technology directly rather than through the complicated spell systems used by his fellow mages; while this knowledge makes him immensely powerful, it also makes him a very unsettling force to the mage leadership, as no other mage is nearly powerful enough to flay him (forcibly remove his implants). As of 2262 Galen is one of only two known mages (the other being Alwyn) to not be in the hiding place, choosing when it suits him to help John Sheridan, Matthew Gideon and the Excalibur crew in their quest to find a cure to the Drakh virus. In reality, Galen is primarily concerned with Shadow technology falling into the wrong hands - namely, both the Drakh and Earthforce Special Weapons Division - and understands that he may well be the only person alive capable of preventing it. In the year 2271 Galen contacts President Sheridan to warn him that the Earth will be destroyed in 30 years' time unless Sheridan intervenes now. Alwyn. Played by Edward Woodward (Peter Woodward's father). The only known surviving technomage to have stayed behind to fight the Shadows, Alwyn was a close friend of Galen's parents and became an uncle figure to Galen after their deaths. Boisterous, loud, rebellious, hard-drinking, gambling and womanizing, Alwyn takes great delight in being everything that a good technomage should not be - while simultaneously drawing both the ire and admiration of his fellow mages. When the technomages fled the galaxy in January 2259, Alwyn broke with the order in contempt of their decision to hide; he then began engaging a guerrilla campaign against the Shadows' minions, playing (alongside Galen, who left the hiding place to fight) a pivotal role in the outcome of the Shadow War. After the war, Alwyn returned to his place of power on Regula 4 (Crusade episode ""The Long Road""), as of 2267 still disgusted that his fellow technomages refuse to come out of hiding. Isabelle. Played by Sophie Ward, Galen's dead ""love""; he makes it clear that their relationship was not a ""marriage"" as we would understand it, but they nevertheless shared an intensely deep emotional and sexual relationship. Galen blames himself for Isabelle's violent death at the hand of traitor technomages, a death that could possibly have been prevented had Galen used the Spell of Destruction against the explicit orders of the Elders. Galen later hijacks the Excalibur in order to take Isabelle's ashes to the newly-located Well of Forever, a sacred place buried in hyperspace sought by Isabelle all her life. While this act has given Galen some closure, Isabelle's fate continues to torture Galen. Wierden. The Technomage of the Taratimude (the first race to receive the Shadow implants) who codified the Order's teachings one thousand years before the time of the 2259-2261 Shadow War. While Wierden is dogmatically held in the highest respect in the Order, Wierden's legacy is only partly based on true history - in many ways and for several reasons, historical revisionism has rendered the story of Wierden into little more than a fairy tale, and a significant amount of unflattering truth regarding Wierden has traditionally been held an extremely close secret by the mage Elders. Others. Other notable mages include Kane, Gwynn, and Finian, who made appearances in Peter David's ""Legions of Fire Trilogy"", and Blaylock, Burrell, Carvin, Ing-Radi, Kell, Herazade, Elizar, and Razeel, who made appearances in the ""Technomage Trilogy"". The script for the unproduced Crusade episode ""The End of The Line"" contains a scene with Galen conversing with a Technomage called Deek, who appears to be in a position of power among the Technomages. However, this character is not mentioned anywhere else. On television. Babylon 5: The Memory of Shadows. The Memory of Shadows is the cancelled Babylon 5 movie that was intended to shoot in 2005, it would have featured Galen and a rival technomage Tyrell. Games. Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game. The Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game by Precedence Publishing (also called B5:CCG) has cards representing several Technomages. The Premier and Deluxe editions have an Elric card, while the Crusade edition contains cards for Alwyn, Blaylock, Galen (with alternate artwork here), Genius Loci, and Isabelle. "
wikipedia-1274569," Mark Trevorrow  Mark Trevorrow (born 4 February 1959 in Melbourne, Victoria), is an Australian comedian, television host and media personality. Career. He first came to prominence in the cabaret duo Globos with Wendy De Waal, and they scored two Australian Top 20 hits with quirky covers of ""Tintarella de Luna"" (1982) and Sonny & Cher's ""The Beat Goes On"" (1983), both of which were produced by Red Symons. In 1984 he formed a comedy duo in with Cathy Armstrong, in which his flamboyant alter ego Bob Downe was born. ""Bob Downe"" is a cheesy, safari-suit-wearing lounge singer with dazzling teeth, and host of the fictional regional daytime TV show ""Good Morning Murwillumbah"". The distinction between the two personae is often blurred: Trevorrow and the ""Prince of Polyester"" both appear at events and host television programs. In January 1987 Mark went solo with the character at Sydney's Harold Park Hotel. In 1988 he took Bob to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he was a huge and instant success. Bob Downe played throughout the 1990s to ever larger British audiences, with Mark in perpetual commute between London and Sydney, touring nationally in both countries. With a multitude of UK TV credits under his beige belt, Bob made his twelfth Edinburgh Fringe appearance in 2002. Back in Australia, the first Bob Downe album, ""Greatest Hits"", was released in Australia in 1996, with 1997's Jazzy! nominated for a Best Comedy Album ARIA music award. 1998 saw the Australian publication of his first book, ""All Bob Downe!"" (Penguin) and he hosted the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade broadcast for Network Ten. In 1999 and 2000, Bob again hosted the Mardi Gras Parade, a consistent ratings winner for Network Ten, and also won won Cabaret Artiste of the Year at the Green Room Awards in Melbourne. He released his third album, ""Huge Hits"", in 2001. Bob's comedy/chat series, ""The Bob Downe Show"" (Foxtel/TV1), went to air in December 2000. Bob Downe's last three national theatre tours, ""Million Sellers"" (1999), ""Whiter! Brighter!"" (2000) and ""Cold August Night"" (2002) have been sellouts everywhere, including the Sydney Opera House and the State Theatre. In 2001, Trevorrow made his first appearance as himself rather than his alter-ego, opening a new show at the Black Cat cabaret in Melbourne. The show also appeared at the Sydney Opera House Studio in 2003, followed by a studio album ""It's About Time"" in 2004 (ABC Music/Universal). Trevorrow has appeared on the Australian series of ""Good News Week"", often joining with host Paul McDermott in a sing-along of an Australian song at the end of the episode. He has collaborated several times with the Doug Anthony All Stars (which included McDermott), appearing in their TV series, ""DAAS Kapital"", and their film ""The Edinburgh Years"". He has also featured in episodes of the sitcom ""Kath & Kim"", as well as hosting the series ""The Way We Were"", and has appeared in the animated Australian/Canadian sitcome, Quads, as the voice of Spalding (SBS 2002). Trevorrow is a regular fill-in presenter on the Evening Show on ""702 ABC Sydney"". He has also been a contestant on the special ""Australia's Brainiest Comedian"". Trevorrow was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Murrumbeena, the third son of a builder-turned-teacher and his wife. He has a younger sister and two older brothers. He came out to his family as gay at the age of 13. "
wikipedia-1274571," George Washington Cable  George Washington Cable (October 12, 1844 – January 31, 1925) was an American novelist notable for the realism of his portrayals of Creole life in his native New Orleans, Louisiana. He has been called ""the most important southern artist working in the late 19th century, as well as the first modern southern writer."" In his treatment of racism, mixed-race families and miscegenation, his fiction has been thought to anticipate that of William Faulkner. He also wrote articles critical of contemporary society. Due to hostility against him after two 1885 essays encouraging racial equality and opposing Jim Crow, Cable moved with his family to Northampton, Massachusetts. He lived there for the next thirty years, then moved to Florida. Biography. Cable was born in 1844 in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of George W. Cable, Sr. and Rebecca Boardman Cable. They were wealthy slaveholders who were part of the Presbyterian Church and city society, whose families had moved there after the Louisiana Purchase. First educated in private schools, the younger Cable had to get work after his father died young. He had lost investments and the family struggled financially. Cable later learned French on his own. He served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, which he began in support of slavery and the Southern cause.  His experiences changed his ideas about Southern and Louisiana society, and he began writing during a two-year bout with malaria. In 1870 Cable went into journalism, writing for the ""New Orleans Picayune."" He worked for them from 1865-1879, by which time he had become an established writer.  He was invited to submit stories in ""Scribner's Monthly,"" where his story ""Sieur George"", published in 1873, was a critical and popular success. He published six more stories of Creole life with ""Scribner's"" in the following three years. The stories were collected and published in a book in 1879 as ""Old Creole Life."" While romantic in plot, the stories revealed the multi-cultural and multi-racial nature of antebellum New Orleans society, with ties among French, Spanish, African, Native American and Caribbean Creoles. He also addressed conflicts that arose following the Louisiana Purchase, when traditional New Orleans French Creole society had to confront Anglo-Americans, who ultimately asserted their concept of a biracial society, rather than allowing a multiracial class. In 1880 Cable published his first novel, ""The Grandissimes: A Story of Creole Life"", portraying multiracial members and different classes of society in the early 1800s shortly after the Louisiana Purchase. It had first been serialized in ""Scribner's."" He used it as a way to explore society and its racial injustice, as he addressed European Creoles, the mixed-race class, ""plaçage"", slavery and lynchings.  His novella ""Madame Delphine"" (1881), expanded from a short story, featured the issue of miscegenation, in which a woman of African descent tries to arrange the marriage of her daughter, who has more European ancestry, to one of the French Creole elite. In 1884 he published a work, ""Dr. Sevier,"" on prison reform. Literary historians have said that Cable's treatment of racism in his fiction influenced the later work of William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. He has been called ""the most important southern artist working in the late 19th century, as well as the first modern southern writer."" After these works, Cable seemed to split his efforts between romantic novels and non-fiction articles, in which he expressed his sympathy for racial equality and opposition to Jim Crow, such as ""The Freedman's Case in Equity"" and ""The Silent South,"" both published in 1885. His essays were resented by many white Southerners and generated much controversy.  Since the end of the war, whites had worked to re-establish political and social supremacy over freedmen and those who were free people of color in the antebellum years. The Ku Klux Klan and paramilitary groups had practiced racial intimidation and other efforts to dissuade blacks from voting. After Reconstruction, when Democrats regained control of the state legislature, they imposed legal racial segregation and other measures against blacks.  So much hostility was expressed against Cable in 1885 that he decided to leave the South. He moved with his family to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he continued to write about the South in novels and critical essays. In 1888, he published ""Bonaventure"", described as an ""Acadian pastoral."" In total, he published 14 novels and collections of short fiction. His last novel was ""Lovers of Louisiana"" (1918).  He became friends with Mark Twain, and the two writers did speaking tours together. Twain said of him that  ""when it comes down to moral honesty, limpid impotence, and utterly blameless piety, the Apostles were mere policemen to Cable,"" despite his dark, ""indelicate"" depictions of society. Cable died in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1925. Marriage and family. Cable married Louisa Stewart Bartlett, and they had children. In 1885 the whole family moved to Northampton, Massachusetts in the face of hostilities generated by Cable's articles on racial issues. His wife Louise died in 1904 and Cable married Eva Stenson in 1906. After the death of his second wife Eva in 1923 he married his third wife Hanna Cowing in 1923. Quotation. ""The party had the privilege of idling through this ancient quarter of New Orleans with the South's finest literary genius, the author of ""the Grandissimes."" In him the South has found a masterly delineator of its interior life and its history. In truth, I find by experience, that the untrained eye and vacant mind can inspect it and learn of it and judge of it more clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact with it. With Mr. Cable along to see for you, and describe and explain and illuminate, a jog through that old quarter is a vivid pleasure. And you have a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen things—vivid, and yet fitful and darkling; you glimpse salient features, but lose the fine shades or catch them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination: a case, as it were, of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the rim of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened long-sighted native."" --from Mark Twain's ""Life on the Mississippi"" References. 1.

wikipedia-1274598," Apothecary  Apothecary is a historical name for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses materia medica to physicians, surgeons and patients — a role now served by a pharmacist (or a chemist or dispensing chemist) and some caregivers. In addition to pharmacy responsibilities, the apothecary offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. Apothecaries often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of an apothecary may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology, prior to the formulation of the scientific method. History. Apothecary could date back to 2600 BC to ancient Babylon, which provides one of the earliest records of the practice of the apothecary. Clay tablets were found with medical texts recording symptoms, the prescriptions, and the directions for compounding it. The Papyrus Ebers from ancient Egypt, written around 1500 B.C., contain a collection of more than 800 prescriptions, or ancient recipes for the apothecaries of the time. It mentions over 700 different drugs.  According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, Jolyn Carter, and S. Hadzovic, apothecary shops existed during the Middle Ages in Baghdad by Islamic pharmacists in 754 during the Abbasid Caliphate, or Islamic Golden Age. Apothecaries were also active in Islamic Spain by the 11th century. By the end of the 14th century, Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400) was mentioning an English apothecary in the ""Canterbury Tales"", specifically ""The Nun's Priest's Tale"" as Pertelote speaks to Chauntecleer (lines 181–184): . . . and for ye shal nat tarie,  "". . . and you should not linger, ""Though, in this town there is no apothecary,""  ""I will teach you about herbs myself,""  ""That will be for your health and for your pride.""  from the 15th century to the 16th century, the apothecary gained the status of a skilled practitioner, but by the end of the 19th century, the medical professions had taken on their current institutional form, with defined roles for physicians and surgeons, and the role of the apothecary was more narrowly conceived as that of pharmacist (dispensing chemist in British English). In England, the apothecaries merited their own livery company, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, founded in 1617. Its roots, however, go back much earlier to the Guild of Pepperers formed in London in 1180. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson became the first woman to gain a medical qualification in Britain when she passed the Society's examination in 1865. Apothecaries used their own measurement system, the apothecaries' system, to provide precise weighing of small quantities. Apothecaries also were known to accept special requests for viles ""and poisons"". "
wikipedia-1274623," Polycentrism  Polycentrism is the principle of organization of a region around several political, social or financial centres. Examples of polycentric cities include the Ruhr area in Germany, and Stoke-on-Trent in the UK. Today, the former is a large city that grew from a dozen smaller cities, the latter a federation of six smaller towns. As a result, these ""cities"" have no single centre, but several. Other examples are Randstad in the Netherlands or Greater Boston in the United States. A county is said to be polycentric if its population is distributed almost evenly among several centres in different parts of the county. The theory of polycentrism was coined by Palmiro Togliatti and was understood as characterization of working conditions of communist parties in comparison between different countries after the de-stalinization in the former Soviet Union 1956. Later the term polycentrism was extended and used for a system with several centres, as ""unity in diversity"" (politology, architecture, city planning). In intercultural competence the term polycentrism is understood as attitude and openness towards other cultures, opinions and ways of life: when intercultural actions and correlations are interpreted not only with the background of own cultural experiences, but when the independence of other cultures is recognized and appreciated and when cultural values are relativized and seen in the whole context. This in the way of non-ethnocentrism, opposite to ethnocentrism. In an article in The Nation (March 6, 2006) on ""The World Social Forum: Protest or Celebration,"" Michael Blanding writes, ""This year, the Caracas forum was one of three in a new 'polycentric' format intended to foster more regional collaboration."" The quotes around ""polycentric"" indicate that this is a new use of the word. It is apt, in that most of those who attend gatherings like the World Social Forum are opposed to what could be called the ""unicentrism"" that characterizes imperial, neoliberal, and neoconservative economic and political theories and institutions; such people could be said to adherents to ""polycentrism.""

wikipedia-1274624," James E. Williams  James Elliott Williams (November 13, 1930–October 13, 1999) was a sailor of the United States Navy during the 1950s and 1960s. He was the most highly decorated enlisted man in the history of the United States Navy. Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina and moved two months later with his parents to Darlington, South Carolina where he spent his early childhood and youth. He attended the local schools and graduated from St. John's high school. He was married to the former Elaine Weaver and they had five children and seven grandchildren. He is buried at the Florence National Cemetery in Florence, South Carolina. He has a son James Williams, granddaughter Sarah Caroline Williams, and great granddaughter Ava Bianca Svaton who are all from Darlington, SC. Navy service. In July 1947, at the age of 16, he entered the United States Navy where he served for twenty years, retiring in April 1967. During those twenty years he served in both the Korean and Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the petty officer was assigned to the River Patrol Force whose mission was to intercept Viet Cong arms shipments on the waterways of South Vietnam's Mekong Delta. On October 31, 1966, Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Williams, patrol commander for his boat, ""River Patrol Boat 105"", and another PBR were searching for Viet Cong guerrillas operating in an isolated area of the Mekong Delta. Suddenly, Communist guerrillas manning two sampans opened fire on the Americans. When Williams and his men neutralized one boat crew, the other one escaped into a nearby canal. The PBR sailors gave chase and soon found themselves in a beehive of enemy activity as Viet Cong guerrillas opened fire on them with rocket propelled grenades and small arms from fortified river bank positions.  Against overwhelming odds, Williams led his PBRs several times against concentrations of enemy junks and sampans. He also called for support from the heavily armed UH-1B Huey helicopters of Navy Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron 3, the ""Seawolves."" When that help arrived, he kicked off another attack in the failing light, cleverly turning on his boats' searchlights to illuminate enemy forces and positions. As a result of the three-hour battle, the American naval force killed numerous Viet Cong guerrillas, destroyed over fifty vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic operation. BM1 Williams not only displayed great courage under fire, but a keen understanding of how his sailors, weapons, and equipment could be used to achieve victory. Military decorations. On May 14, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson, in the name of Congress, presented Williams the Medal of Honor. His other awards include the Navy Cross, Silver Star (with one gold award star), the Legion of Merit with ""V"" device, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal with gold award star, Bronze Star with ""V"" device and two gold award stars, Purple Heart with two gold award stars, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with ""V"" device and gold award star, Navy and Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation with bronze service star, the Navy Good Conduct Medal with four bronze service stars, the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with bronze service star, the Korean Service Medal with two bronze stars, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal with two bronze service stars.  His foreign decorations include the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Gold Star and Palm, United Nations Korean Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and (not shown) the Korean War Service Medal. U.S. Marshal service. Williams retired from active service in 1967 and was employed with the Wackenhut Corporation. In 1969, he was appointed U. S. Marshal for the District of South Carolina where he served until May 1977. He was then transferred to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, Georgia as an instructor and National Armorer. He was called back to South Carolina in July 1979 under court appointment as U. S. Marshal for South Carolina and served in that position until April 1980. He was then transferred to U. S. Marshal service Headquarters, Washington, D. C. as Programs Manager, Health and Safety and In-District Training Officer where he served until his retirement from the U. S. Marshals Service with the grade of GS-1811-15. "
wikipedia-1274640," Proceedings  In academia, proceedings are the collection of academic papers published in the context of an academic conference. They are usually distributed as printed volumes or in electronic form either before the conference opens or after it has closed. Proceedings contain the contributions made by researchers at the conference. They are the written record of the work that is presented to fellow researchers. The collection of papers is organized by one or more persons, who form the ""editorial team"". The quality of the papers is typically ensured by having external people read the papers before they are accepted in the proceedings. This process is called reviewing. Depending on the level of the conference, this process including making revisions can take up to a year. The editors decide about the composition of the proceedings, the order of the papers, and produce the preface and possibly other pieces of text. Although most changes in papers occur on basis of consensus between editors and authors, editors can also single-handedly make changes in papers. Since the collection of papers comes from individual researchers, the character of proceedings is distinctly different from a textbook. Each paper typically is quite isolated from the other papers in the proceedings. Mostly there is no general argument leading from one contribution to the next. In some cases, the set of contributions is so coherent and high-quality that the editors of the proceedings may decide to further develop the proceedings into a textbook. This may even be a goal at the outset of the conference. Proceedings are published in-house by the organizing institution of the conference or via an academic publisher. For example, the ""Lecture Notes in Computer Science"" by Springer take much of their input from proceedings. Increasingly, proceedings are published in electronic format via the internet or on CD. In the sciences, the quality of publications in conference proceedings is usually not as high as that of international scientific journals. However, a number of full-fledged academic journals unconnected to particular conferences also use the word ""proceedings"" as part of their name, for example, ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"".

wikipedia-1274646," Kellenberg Memorial High School  Kellenberg Memorial High School is a Roman Catholic college-preparatory school in Uniondale, Long Island, New York. Kellenberg is the second Marianist school on Long Island and prides itself on high academic standards combined with a strong focus on faith. History. Kellenberg Memorial High School is named in honor of Most Rev. Walter P. Kellenberg, founding Bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. He had a particularly strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Both in his preaching and his example, he sought to bring all under the protection of Our Lady. The Bishop was a strong supporter of Catholic education, as evidenced by his extensive building program for the school system of the diocese. The school is owned and directed by the Society of Mary (Marianists), a religious order of priests and brothers. The Marianists were founded in 1817 by Blessed William Joseph Chaminade to educate youth as a means of Christianize society. In September, 1987, the administration of Kellenberg Memorial High School announced the establishment of the Bro. Joseph C. Fox Latin School. The Latin School is named in honor of a Marianist brother, Bro. Joseph C. Fox, who taught for over fifty years in Catholic schools. This new division of KMHS provides a qualitative Catholic education to students from the public schools in grades six through eight. Philosophy. Kellenberg Memorial High School combines the proven curriculum and methods of a successful tradition with modern pedagogical advances to provide its students with a rich, qualitative educational experience. The Kellenberg Memorial High School program, offered in an atmosphere of positive Christian commitment, requires a thorough study of the basic intellectual disciplines, while offering extensive cocurricular and extracurricular opportunities for practical application and personal understanding. Campus. Kellenberg is accessed through the main entrance across from RXR Plaza on Glenn Curtiss Blvd. Although the lobby was originally designed as the main entrance, the school is oriented toward its north entrance. The north entrance of the school features a mural of the Holy Family, including a depiction of Jesus as a teenager, designed by artist Yan Rieger in 1997, in honor of the school's tenth anniversary. Students and Marianists assisted the artist and his wife with the execution of the mural. Kellenberg Memorial has five athletic fields, baseball, football, softball etc., four of which separately named after each of the Four Evangelists. The school also is the caretakers of two Nassau County properties, one east of the school and one west, which are used for athletic purposes. These properties are named Jerusalem and Jericho respectively, after the two biblical cities.A new artificial turf field was installed during the summer of 2010. This marks a series of campus improvements and expansions that will take place throughout 2010 and 2011. Kellenberg's campus features three cortyards and four chapels. Kellenberg's main courtyard is located in the center of the building and contains a koi river, four bridges, and a central bell tower. Many interior classrooms overlook this courtyard and students are permitted to pass through the courtyard between classes. Academics.

It is also registered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Latin School. The school also operates the Brother Joseph C. Fox Latin School on its campus. Serving students from grades 6–8, it was originally designed to serve students who started in public school but wished to transfer into the Catholic system; it now accepts students from both public and Catholic elementary schools.  Admission to the program is highly competitive, with many applying over a year in advance. The nature of the program allows middle school students to have courses taught by high school teachers (often with high school material) and to take part in clubs, activities and services that would normally not be available at a regular middle school. Students in grades 7 and 8 are required to take Latin, with those who remain at Kellenberg for high school placed in accelerated classes. Students who graduate from the program are guaranteed admission to the high school; however, they are required to take the CHSEE for statistical and quality-assurance purposes. While the school has a separate administration for academics, guidance and discipline, the schools are otherwise administered as one unit, sharing facilities and faculty and with most clubs and activities run as one Grade 6–12 unit; the administration of the Latin School is subsidiary to that of the greater school, with the Assistant Principal for the Latin School answerable to the Principal and President of Kellenberg Memorial High School. It is the only Latin School on Long Island; New York City also has the public Brooklyn Latin School. Faculty. As of April 2010, the faculty included 130 members, including 4 Marianist Priests and 12 Marianist Brothers. Many of the school administrators maintain teaching roles in the school. There is also a large school staff body consisting of about 70 members. Many members of the Society of Mary have canine companions that often follow them to the classroom or reside in their offices during the day, sometimes cited as a very likable trait of the school. Much of the faculty and school staff are alumni. Administrators have contributed articles to a diverse range of publications, from the religious ""Catalyst"" to the mainstream New York Times. Current faculty include present college faculty, published authors and professional musicians, and former faculty members contributed to works still included in the school's curriculum, from history classes to faith-based clubs. Music produced by student organizations is sold at online music retailers. Co-curricular and extracurricular activities. In the Marianist tradition, many students join sodality groups to mutually reinforce their Catholic faith. The groups meet weekly and participate in various religious activities. The school also operates Emmanuel, a Marianist Retreat House devoted to students' spiritual formation.  A major co-curricular focus is music. Activities in this area include Band (four levels), Chorus (four levels), Guitar Club, Jazz Band, the Firebird Swing Jazz Choir, Orchestra, Pit Band, and Jubilee Choir, Gregorian Consortium (sometimes called St. Greg's). Publications include ""Blue and Gold"" (a school yearbook), ""The Renaissance"" (a literary magazine), ""The Phoenix"" (a school newspaper), and three additional divisional newspapers—The Sophomore Senitel, The Freshman Flash, and the Early Bird, (a Latin school publication). Kellenberg also has an Academic Quiz Bowl team and a Science Olympiad team. The Academic Quiz Bowl team came in 11th place at the NAQT High School National Championship and placed second in the 2010 season of the New York area TV show The Challenge. The team won the 2009 New York State NAQT tournament, placing first in the state with the JV team in fifth; at the state level, three of the top five players came from Kellenberg teams. The Science Olympiad team has qualified for the New York State Science Olympiad Competition for the past 15 years. A major activity for female students at Kellenberg is the Blue and Gold sports night. The students who participate are divided into two teams, a blue team and a gold team. The girls practice from February until May. The competition takes place on one night in early May and attracts a widespread Long Island audience. Kellenberg administrators have twice eliminated activities that they considered ""no longer commensurate with the goals of a Christian education"". Kellenberg first abolished the school's hockey team, reasoning that hockey ""kept degenerating into physical mayhem"". And in 2006, the school received national attention when the principal, Brother Kenneth Hoagland, canceled the Senior Prom. In a letter from late March 2006, he cited booze cruises sponsored by parents, cocktail parties, and the film ""American Pie"" as examples of ""adolescent culture being formed and led by the media"". The school received national attention from ABC, CNN, Fox News, MTV, ""The New York Times"", and Comedy Central's ""The Colbert Report"". "
wikipedia-1274671," Bais Yaakov  Bais Yaakov (בית יעקב also written ""Beit Yaakov"", ""Beth Jacob"", or ""Beis Yaakov"" -- literally ""House Jacob"" in Hebrew) is a common name for Orthodox full-time Jewish elementary and secondary schools throughout the world for Jewish girls from religious families. While these schools share the Bais Yaakov name, they are not necessarily affiliated, though some are, for other reasons. The name comes from a verse in Exodus 19:3, in which the term ""house of Jacob"" is traditionally understood in Judaism to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation. History. The Bais Yaakov movement was started by seamstress Sarah Schenirer in 1917 in Kraków, Poland. The first school building survives as apartments and is marked with a bronze plaque. While boys attended cheder and Talmud Torah schools (and in some cases yeshivas), at that time there was no formalized system of Jewish education for girls and young Jewish women. Sarah Schenirer saw that there was a high rate of assimilation among girls due to the secular influences of the non-Jewish schools that the girls were then attending.  Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout Europe. She obtained the approval of Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the ""Chofetz Chaim""), who issued a responsum holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of Agudath Israel. The original Bais Yaakov was a seminary of sorts, intended to train girls to themselves become teachers and spread the Bais Yaakov movement. After World War II, Jews who came to North America, Israel, and other places established girls' schools of the same name, although some claim that the educational philosophy differs slightly from that of the original Bais Yaakov schools. Besides elementary and high schools, there are also post-secondary schools in the Bais Yaakov system, usually referred to as seminaries. The seminaries run various courses generally lasting between one to three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts. Current. Educational approach. The educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of Haredi Judaism and the Agudath Israel movement. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the curriculum, whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values. Students are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ""tznius"" (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, oxford shirt, and sweater or sweatshirt. The schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be good Jews, mothers, and wives, and contributors to family and community. Secular studies are often secondary, though still considered important. Curriculum. Most non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of Torah (commonly referred to as ""Chumash""), Nevi'im (Prophets), and other parts of the Hebrew Bible; instruction in Hebrew language; Jewish history; and study of practical ""Halacha"" (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and sometimes as a summary of classic Halacha sources.  The ""Tanach"" is studied through the lens of commentaries. Orthodox Judaism teaches that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught to read commentary, especially Rashi when they begin to learn Torah.  The curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of (male) yeshivas, in that a core component of study for males is the Talmud. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of aggadah. This contrasts with the approach of many Modern Orthodox Jewish day schools, which increasingly teach Talmud to women. Locations. Branches exist in most North American cities with large populations of Orthodox Jews such as New York, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, St. Louis, Toronto, Lakewood, Passaic, Monsey, and in most Israeli cities. Beis Yaakov-type schools are also found in major Jewish centers in Europe, such as London, Manchester, Antwerp and Moscow, and in other Jewish centers around the world, Including Johannesburg, South Africa. Pre-war locations included Wlodawa and Krakow Poland. Hasidic schools. Schools for girls within the Hasidic world share the same values, outlook, methodology, and aims of the non-Hasidic Haredi schools. However, they may place a greater emphasis on the teachings of their individual Hasidic Rebbes and much of the instruction may be conducted in Yiddish, which is still the home language for most Hasidic families in the world today. Also, in many Hasidic Beis Yaakov schools in Israel, English is often not taught, unlike in regular Bais Yaakov schools, where English is taught. Schools for young Hasidic girls which are not part of the Bais Yaakov movement take names such as: "
wikipedia-1274684," Montrouge  Montrouge () is a commune in the southern Parisian suburbs, located from the center of Paris, France. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. After a long period of decline, the population has increased again in recent years. History. There are a number of colorful traditions about the name ""Montrouge"", but it appears that it in fact comes from the Latin words ""monte"" (mountain) and ""rubeus"" (red), meaning Red Mountain, because of the reddish color of the earth in this area. The name of the community was first mentioned in monastery documents in 1194. Throughout the Middle Ages, the hamlet was home to monasteries and a number of religious orders, while in the 15th century it became the site of quarries used for the reconstruction of Paris. The late sixteenth century saw the plain of Montrouge named ""reserve for royal hunts"", and during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was known for its windmills, which, sadly, have all now disappeared. On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, most of the commune of Montrouge was annexed to Paris, forming what is now called Petit-Montrouge, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. The remainder of Montrouge was preserved as an independent town. In 1875, the town gained a few thousand square metres from the neighboring communes of Châtillon and Bagneux (principally in the neighborhood (""le quartier"") called Haut Mesnil). Economy. Industrial development started in 1925 and soon, many printing factories were to be found in the town. Most of these have disappeared today. Since the early years of the twenty-first century, professional services and telecommunications have been the main business activities. Public transport. Montrouge is served by the Mairie de Montrouge station on Paris Métro Line 4, and by the Châtillon – Montrouge station on Paris Métro Line 13. The Châtillon - Montrouge station is located at the border between the commune of Montrouge and the commune of Châtillon, on the Châtillon side of the border. The Mairie de Montrouge station was opened on 23rd March, 2013 as part of the extension of Metro Line 4 to the south. Two further stations (Verdun Sud, and Bagneux) have been planned, although no date has been set for their opening. Bus line 68 runs from Metro Châtillon Montrouge all the way up through Montparnasse, the Louvre, the Paris Opera and ends at the Place de Clichy, site of the Moulin Rouge. The Arts in Montrouge. Montrouge was the home of a number of well-known twentieth century artists, listed below. Currently the town is also well known for two contemporary art exhibitions: Personalities.

wikipedia-1274703," Westminster Assembly  The Westminster Assembly (the Westminster Assembly of Divines) was appointed by the Long Parliament to restructure the Church of England. It also included representatives of religious leaders from Scotland. The Assembly met for six years (1643–49), and in the process produced the Westminster Standards, which are the major Confessional Standards of the Presbyterian faith, including the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Larger Catechism, the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and the Directory of Public Worship.  Background. The impetus for the Assembly was division in the Church over doctrine, polity, and worship practice. The Assembly was also intended to oppose Laudianism, a movement in the Church of England toward Arminianism and hierarchical church government. Parliament published a list of theologians who would form an advisory committee on religious matters in the summer of 1642, to be called at a later date. Many of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury, and some had fled to the Continent. The Puritan faction in Parliament made five attempts to appoint an assembly between June 1642 and May 1643, but each time King Charles refused to sign the bill. A sixth bill was prepared and passed as an ordinance of the House of Commons; and, with the agreement of the House of Lords it became effective without the king's assent in June 1643.  The Assembly consisted of 30 laymen (10 lords and 20 commoners) and 121 divines or clergymen. The clergy were selected to represent four separate groups: With the abdication of the Episcopalians and the deaths of a few others, Parliament determined that an additional twenty-one ministers should be appointed, these to be known as superadded divines. The average daily attendance was between sixty and eighty members.  Proceedings. The Assembly's first meeting was a sermon by William Twisse, the Assembly's prolocutor or spokesman, in the nave of Westminster Abbey on July 1, 1643. The room was so full that the House of Commons had to send members ahead to secure seats. Only sixty-nine of the 120 summoned theologians appeared, probably because Parliament only provided four or five days notice, and the divines were scattered through every county of England and Wales. It later moved to the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster. It met 1,163 times between 1643 and 1649, and was never formally dissolved by Parliament. During the Interregnum, it met generally only for judicial matters to examine ministers who presented themselves for ordination or induction into vacant charges. The Westminster Assembly was an advisory arm of the Parliament who selected its members, proposed its topics for discussion and delineated its scope of work. Parliament provided an allowance of four shillings per day for each of the divines to defray their expenses. The first task given to the Assembly was revision of the Thirty-Nine Articles. The first ten weeks of the Assembly were expended in debating the first fifteen of the Articles. The Assembly's first meeting with a theological focus was on 12 July 1643. The Assembly resolved, after some debate, that all the doctrines of the Thirty-Nine articles would need to be proven from the Bible. They then began to debate the suffering of Christ, found in the second article. Since John Calvin argued during the Reformation that the ""descensus"" (the clause of the Apostles' Creed stating that Christ descended into Hell) referred to Christ's suffering on the cross rather than an actual descent into the place of dead, the issue of Christ's sufferings was connected to the descent into Hell and was hotly contested among English Calvinists. The Assembly adopted a version of Calvin's teaching on Christ's suffering. The Assembly then debated the ""descensus"" until 17 August, when it was decided that the article be amended to say that the ""descensus"" simply meant that Christ ""continued in the state of the dead"" until the resurrection. The issue was quickly raised again, however, when the Assembly began to debate the eighth article, which recommended the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed to be received and believed. The Assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds, arguing that the articles only the require the ""matter"" of the creeds be believed, and those who wished to retain the existing language that the creeds be ""thoroughly received and beleeved"". On 25 August, the matter was put off until the rest of the articles could be dealt with. The civil war between the forces of Parliament and the Royalists supporting Charles I was at a stalemate. Irish Catholics who had revolted in 1641 were threatening to join the Royalist side. Desperate for help, Parliament sent a delegation to the Scots seeking aid in their civil matter. Though the English sought to enter into a civil league for defense of civil liberties, the Scots quickly responded that the spirit of the contest in which they had been engaged (the Bishop's Wars) was of a religious character, in defense of religious liberty. Eventually the two sides forged a document intended to serve both causes, The Solemn League and Covenant. In return for sending the Scottish army south to support the Parliament, the Scots obliged the English to reform the Church of England ""for the preservation of religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches"" and the extirpation of prelacy and popery. Six Scottish commissioners were appointed to travel to England to sit with the Westminster Assembly. The Parliaments of England and Scotland eventually required that all persons above the age of 18 in both countries swear to the oath of the Solemn League and Covenant. On October 12, 1643, the Westminster Assembly received a directive from Parliament that the divines should forthwith ""confer and treat among themselves of such a discipline and government as may be most agreeable to God's holy word, and most apt to procure and preserve the peace of the church at home, and nearer agreement with the Church of Scotland and other Reformed Churches abroad."" The Assembly abandoned work on the Thirty-Nine Articles and proceeded to create an entirely new set of documents. Over the next four years, the Assembly produced and forwarded to Parliament ""The Directory for the Publick Worship of God"", ""The Form of Presbyterial Church Government"", a creedal statement, ""The Westminster Confession of Faith"", a ""Larger Catechism"" and a ""Shorter Catechism"". The House of Commons insisted that the Assembly include scriptural proof texts with the Confession and the two catechisms. The divines also examined and approved the use of Rouse's metrical version of the Psalter in general worship. All of these documents were debated fiercely. The Erastians, Presbyterians and Independents could never agree on church government. The Independents were thoroughly congregational in their view of church officials. They resisted the idea of church courts and held that members of each congregation should have all power and authority. They agreed that each congregation should choose their own minister, but they opposed regulation and correction of those choices by presbyteries. The Erastians believed in civil authority over the ecclesiastical. In their minds the civil magistrate, being Christian, should have jurisdiction instead of church courts. Sin was to be punished by civil courts, and ecclesiastical bodies should be forbidden from withholding sacraments or excommunication. Legacy. The completed work of the Westminster Assembly was eventually adopted with revisions in England, but was revoked during the Restoration in 1660. All of the documents were embraced by the Church of Scotland. Further, they formed the cornerstone of the Presbyterian Church and other reformed churches as they established themselves throughout Europe and America. Extensive fresh research on the Westminster Assembly is being conducted by the Westminster Assembly Project, based in Cambridge, England. In 2012, Oxford University Press published the five-volume (3200 pages) ""The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643-1652"", edited by Chad Van Dixhoorn. "
wikipedia-1274748," José Ortega Cano  José María Ortega Cano (born December 27, 1953) is a Spanish bullfighter. He was married to Spanish singer Rocío Jurado. They adopted two Colombian children, one boy and one girl. He started with his bullfighting career in 1973 in Madrid. In 1986 he was very successful in many bullrings. He married in 1995 the famous singer Rocío Jurado. He retired in 1998, but he put again the ""traje de luces"" in 2001, although with less success. In 2004 he retired again to take care of his wife Rocío Jurado, who had pancreatic cancer. Rocío died in 2006 and Ortega Cano did one more work in 2007 in Olivenza.  He participated on a weekly TV program called ""Mira quién baila"" (Spanish version of ""Dancing with the Stars""), where he showed no talent for dancing. On May 29, 2011 he was involved in a car accident in which another driver died and was in critical condition, until July 11, 2011 when he left the hospital after a slow recovery. On April 24, 2013 the court number 6 of Sevilla sentenced Ortega Cano to two years, six months and one day in prison for reckless homicide and reckless driving that caused the death of Carlos Parra in the mentioned accident. Ortega Cano's lawyer, Enrique Trebolle Lafuente, will appeal the ruling. "
wikipedia-1274750," Congressional Quarterly  Congressional Quarterly, Inc., or CQ, is part of a privately owned publishing company called CQ Roll Call that produces a number of publications reporting primarily on the United States Congress. CQ was acquired by the Economist Group and combined with Roll Call to form CQ Roll Call in 2009. As of 2009, CQ ceased to exist as a separate entity. Overview. CQ was founded in 1945 by Nelson Poynter and his wife, Henrietta Poynter, with the aim of providing a link between local newspapers and the complex politics within Washington D.C. CQ has the largest news team covering Capitol Hill, with more than 100 reporters, editors and researchers. CQ's readership includes 95 percent of the members of Congress, academic and media outlets, as well as members of business and nonprofit organizations, government affairs and the executive branch. Thomas N. Schroth, who had been managing editor of ""The Brooklyn Eagle"", was elected in October 1955 as executive editor and vice president. Schroth built the publication's impartial coverage, with annual revenue growing during his tenure from $150,000 when he started to $1.8 million. In addition to adding a book division, Schroth added many staff members who achieved future journalistic success, including David S. Broder, Neal R. Peirce, and Elizabeth Drew. He was fired from ""Congressional Quarterly"" in 1969 after festering disagreements with Poynter over editorial policy at the publication and Schroth's efforts to advocate ""more imaginative ways of doing things"" reached a boil. In 1965, Poynter summed up his reasons for founding CQ, saying: ""The federal government will never set up an adequate agency to check on itself, and a foundation is too timid for that. So it had to be a private enterprise beholden to its clients."" Despite its name, CQ was published quarterly for only one year. Demand drove more frequent updates, first weekly, then daily. CQ was also an early leader in delivering information on a real-time basis, starting with a dial-up service in 1984. Its website dominates the market for online legislative tracking information and has been nominated for several awards. In recent years, CQ has launched several electronic-only newsletters with greater focus on particular areas, including ""CQ Homeland Security, CQ BudgetTracker, and ""CQ HealthBeat.""

wikipedia-1274780," Emu War  The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War, was a nuisance wildlife management operation undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia. The attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with machine guns—leading the media to adopt the name ""Emu War"" when referring to the incident. Background. Following World War I, large numbers of ex-soldiers from Australia, along with a number of British veterans, took up farming within Western Australia, often in marginal areas. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were encouraged to increase their wheat crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the form of subsidies. In spite of the recommendations and the promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while simultaneously threatening to refuse to load the wheat. The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the arrival of as many as 20,000 emus. Emus regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water supplies being made available for livestock by the West Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm territory—in particular the marginal farming land around Campion and Walgoolan. The emus consumed and spoiled the crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where rabbits could enter and cause further problems. Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in WWI, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their deployment. The Minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, and troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice, although it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed this as a way of being seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, and towards that end a Fox Movietone cinematographer was enlisted. The ""War"". Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932. The ""war"" was conducted under the command of Major G.P.W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery, with Meredith commanding a pair of soldiers armed with two Lewis Automatic Machine Guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The operation was delayed, however, by a period of rainfall which caused the emus to scatter over a wider area. The rain had ceased by 2 November 1932, at which point the troops were deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu skins so that their feathers could be used to make hats for light horsemen. The first attempt. On 2 November the men traveled to Campion, where some 50 emus were sighted. As the birds were out of range of the guns, the local settlers attempted to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split into small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target. Nevertheless, while the first fusillade from the machine guns was ineffective due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to kill ""a number"" of birds. Later the same day a small flock was encountered, and ""perhaps a dozen"" birds were killed. The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, and over 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the birds were at point blank range before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed, however, and the remainder scattered before more could be killed. No more birds were sighted that day. In the days that followed Meredith chose to move further south where the birds were ""reported to be fairly tame"", but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts. At one stage Meredith even went so far as to mount one of the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was both unable to gain on the birds and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account claims just 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500—the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties. Summarizing the culls, ornithologist Dominic Serventy commented: On 8 November, representatives in the Australian House of Representatives discussed the operation. Following the negative coverage of the events in the local media, which included claims that ""only a few"" emus had died, Pearce withdrew the military personnel and the guns on 8 November. After the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to Zulus, and commented on the striking maneuverability of the emus, even while badly wounded. The second attempt. After the withdrawal of the military, the emu attacks on crops continued. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. Additionally, a report from the Base Commander indicated that 300 emus had been killed in the initial operation. Acting on the requests and the Base Commander's report, by 12 November the Minister of Defence approved the military party to resume their efforts. He defended the decision in the senate, explaining why the soldiers were necessary to combat the serious agricultural threat of the large emu population. Although the military had agreed to loan the guns to Western Australian government on the expectation that they would provide the necessary people, Meredith was once again placed in the field due to an apparent lack of experienced machine gunners in the state. Taking to the field on 13 November 1932, the military found a degree of success over the first two days, with approximately 40 emus killed. The third day, 15 November, proved to be far less successful, but by 2 December the guns were accounting for approximately 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had died as a result of the injuries that they had sustained. Aftermath. In spite of the problems encountered with the cull, the farmers of the region once again requested military assistance in 1934, 1943 and 1948, only to be turned down by the Government. Instead, the bounty system that had been instigated in 1923 was continued, and this proved to be effective: 57,034 bounties were claimed over a six-month period in 1934. By December 1932, word of the Emu War had spread, reaching to Great Britain. Some conservationists there protested the cull as ""extermination of the rare emu"". Dr. Dominic Serventy, an eminent Australian ornithologist, described the cull as ""an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds"". "
wikipedia-1274782," Gillian Armstrong  Gillian May Armstrong (born 18 December 1950) is an award-winning Australian director of feature films and documentaries. Biography. Armstrong was born in Australia, Melbourne, Victoria on 18 December 1950. She went to a local high school, Vermont High, and was the middle child of a local real estate agent father and a primary school teacher mother who gave up work to have a family. Armstrong stated in ""The Australian"" that her parents were always very supportive of their hopes and dream, which was not always the way it was for women in the 1960s and 70s. Her father was a frustrated photographer who wasn't allowed to follow his dreams professionally, yet always practised as an amateur. Armstrong reminiscences of how she grew up in a dark room, learning all about photography. When she first decided to go to the art school, Armstrong didn't have a very firm grasp on what she wanted to do. Armstrong was a technical theatre student at Swinburne College while paying her tuition by working as a waitress. Originally, she attended school to become a theatrical set designer but the school that she attended also offered a film course. After she took it she was enamored by the great names of cinema and decided to enter the film industry. Then she won a scholarship to join the first 12 students at the country's first and only film school, the Australian Film and Television School. While she was in school, The Australian film industry was nonexistent, she recalls how weird the accent sounded in new films, because it wasn't American, it was Australian.  Soon, she became Australia's first female film director at the age of 27. During the time of the development of Australian Cinema Armstrong recalls in a Washington Post interview that tremendous tax breaks led to a frightful overproduction. Everybody was interested in doing deals and even stockbrokers were becoming directors. However, very few of them had the commitment to cinema that Armstrong and others had, and the films would be shown for a week or two, or not released at all. After Armstrong's second film ""My Brilliant Career"", she had offers from Hollywood but quickly turned them all away, preferring to stay in Australia to make a deliberately small film called ""Starstruck"". After the release of ""Starstruck"", Armstrong went around giving interviews dressed in a large fuzzy blue sweater dress decorated with coloured beads, a black-and-white polka dot blouse, black tights and blue suede shoes all topped by a punk shag haircut. Gillian Armstrong is married with two daughters. Career. Born in Melbourne, Victoria, Gillian Armstrong grew up in the eastern suburb of Mitcham. She attended Swinburne Technical College with the intention of becoming a theatre costume designer, but it was here she became increasingly interested in film. During this time, she was exposed to a range of artistic films that differentiated from the commercial cinema and Television she was used to.  After graduating from her four years at art school in 1968, Armstrong was set on pursuing a career in film. She began making short films of 2–10 minutes, and started work as an assistant editor in a commercial film house, which lasted a year. In 1972 she entered, and later graduated from, the Australian Film Television and Radio School. She paid her tuition during this time through waitressing Following a string of small jobs within the Australian film industry, she achieved her first real directorial recognition through her short film ""The Singer and the Dancer"" which won an award at the Sydney Film Festival.  Following this success, Armstrong was commissioned by the South Australian Film Corporation to make a documentary exploring the lives of young teenage girls living in Adelaide, South Australia. This became ""Smokes and Lollies (1976)"", her first paid job as director.  Armstrong's own interest in the girls led her to revisit them at ages 18, 26, 33 and 48, resulting in four more films in the style of the popular ""Up Series"". These are ""Fourteen's Good, Eighteen's Better (1980)"", ""Bingo, Bridesmaids and Braces (1988),"" ""Not Fourteen Again (1996)"", and her most recent film ""Love, Lust & Lies (2009)"" Armstrong's first feature length film ""My Brilliant Career (1979)"", an adaptation of Miles Franklin's novel of the same name, was the first Australian feature length film to be directed by a woman for 46 years. Armstrong received six awards at the 1979 Australian Film Awards (previously the Australian Film Institute Awards, or AFI's) including Best Director. The film also brought considerable attention to its two main stars, Judy Davis and Sam Neill who were relatively unknown at the time.  Following the success of ""My Brilliant Career"", which was nominated for an Academy Award in Best Costume Design, Armstrong directed the Australian rock-musical ""Starstruck (1982)"" which proved her ability to tackle more contemporary and experimental subject matter and styles.  She has directed a number of rock music videos in the early 1980s, including 1984's ""Bop Girl"" by Pat Wilson, which featured a very young Nicole Kidman towards the end of the video Since then, Armstrong has specialised in period drama. She was the first foreign woman to be approached by the American film company MGM to finance her direction of a big-budget feature, which became ""Mrs. Soffel (1984)"" starring Mel Gibson and Diane Keaton This film tells the scandalous true story of an affair between a prisoner and a prison warden's wife, and was relatively well received by audiences and critics On returning to Australia, Armstrong continued to make both documentaries and feature films. She earned great recognition for High Tide (1987) and The Last Days of Chez Nous (1992) in which she was nominated for Best Director at the 1987 and 1992 Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI's). ""The Last Days of Chez Nous"" also earned her a nomination at the Berlin Film Festival. Despite this, both films were largely unrecognised internationally Armstrong discusses the making of ""High Tide"" in the 2003 Canadian documentary Complete Unknown co-directed by Griffin Ondaatje and Craig Proctor.  In 1994, Armstrong achieved her greatest Hollywood success with the adaptation of Little Women, starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst. This adaptation of Louisa Mary Alcott's novel of the same name was one of the most popular films of the year, and emphasises Armstrong's focus on portraying the intimate lives of strong female characters and their relationships with one another.  She followed this success three years later with the film Oscar and Lucinda (1997) starring Ralph Fiennes and a relatively unknown Cate Blanchett. This film, based on the novel by Australian Author Peter Carey, tells the story of a mis-matched love affair in 19th century Australia. It received mixed reviews both locally and internationally, despite its high production value and strong performances by the film main actors In the 2000s, Armstrong went on to direct the feature films Charlotte Gray (2001), starring Cate Blanchett, and Death Defying Acts (2008) starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Guy Pearce. Based on the novel by Sebastian Faulks, ""Charlotte Gray"" is another of Armstrong's films that centres around a strong female protagonist.  Quite removed from Armstrong's usual subject matter, ""Death Defying Acts"" portrays a moment in the life of 1920's escape artist Harry Houdini in the style of a supernatural, romantic thriller. It received a modest earning at the box office, and was part of a special screening at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival  Despite the success of these more commercial films, it was Armstrong's lesser-known documentary which earned her the most critical recognition during this time, and a nomination for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Film themes and style. Style. Armstrong has a distinctive style in her work that resists easy categorisation. Most of her films cannot simply be stated as being either ""women's films"" or Australian ones which are the two most generalised categories for women in her line of work. Armstrong's films are described as mixing and intermingling genres in ways that recreate them as something vastly different than what they have been considered. Nevertheless, the films that Armstrong creates can also be considered conventional films in their appeal to the audience. Her films possess sensitive and delicate cinematography, fluid editing, an evocative feel for setting and costume, and a commitment to solid character development and acting. Themes. Armstrong has voiced her desire to reach a wide audience in her interviews, one that includes both men and women of all nationalities. However, her work continuously addresses sexual politics and family tensions. Films focused on the escape and struggle with traditional sex roles and its related drawbacks and progressions such as ""One hundred a Day"", ""My Brilliant Career"", ""High Tide"", and ""Oscar and Lucinda"" continue to reflect the theme. Furthermore, many people have called her a creator of ""strong females"" but she insists that she is simply making films about complex characters and the choices that they make. "
wikipedia-1274810," Soviet manned lunar programs  The Soviet manned lunar programs were a series of programs pursued by the Soviet Union to land a man on the Moon in competition with the United States Apollo program to achieve the same goal set publicly by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961. The Soviet government publicly denied participating in such a competition, but secretly pursued two programs in the 1960s: manned lunar flyby missions using Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond) spacecraft launched with the UR-500K (Proton) rocket, and a manned lunar landing using Soyuz 7K-L3 and LK Lander spacecraft launched with the N1 rocket. Following the dual American successes of the first manned lunar orbit on December 24–25, 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end: the Proton / Zond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1 / L3 program was terminated de facto in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. Details of both Soviet programs were kept secret until 1990, when the government allowed them to be published under the policy of ""glasnost"". Early concepts. Although the Soviet leadership had made public pronouncements about landing a man on the Moon and establishing a lunar base as early as 1961, serious plans were not made until several years later. Sergei Korolyov, the senior Soviet rocket engineer, was more interested in launching a heavy orbital station and in manned flights to Mars and Venus. With this in mind Korolyov began the development of the super-heavy N-1 rocket with a 75 ton payload. In its preliminary Moon plans, Korolyov's design bureau initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-C circumlunar complex concept under which a two-man spacecraft would rendezvous with other components in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar flyby excursion vehicle. The components would then be delivered by the proven middle R-7 rocket. After developing the N1, beginning in 1963, Korolyov began to plan a Moon landing mission using two launches and docking. Later Korolyov managed to increase the payload of the N1 to 92-93 tons (by switching to liquid hydrogen in the upper stage(s) and increasing the number of engines in its first stage from 24 to 30), providing enough power to accomplish the mission with a single launch.  Another main space design bureau headed by Vladimir Chelomei proposed a competing orbiting mission using a heavy UR-500K rocket (later renamed the Proton rocket) and a two-man LK-1 spacecraft. Later, Chelomei also proposed a Moon landing program with a super-heavy UR-700 rocket and a LK-700(LK-3) spacecraft. The Soviet government issued a response to the American Apollo challenge after three years. According to the first government decree about the Soviet Manned moon programs (' ""On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space"" '), adopted in August 1964, Chelomei was instructed to develop a Moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966, and Korolyov was instructed to develop the Moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967.  Following the change from Nikita Khrushchev to Leonid Brezhnev in 1964, the Soviet government in September 1965 assigned the flyby program to Korolyov, who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own L1 (Zond) spacecraft and Chelomei's Proton rocket.  Korolyov organized full scale development of both programs, but died after surgery in 1966. According to a government decree of February 1967, the first manned flyby was scheduled for mid-1967, and the first manned landing for the end of 1968. Korolyov's death, along with various technical and administrative reasons, as well as a lack of financial support, resulted in both programs being delayed. Launch schedules. As of 1967, the L1/L3 launch schedules were: L1 L3 Cosmonauts. In 1966, two cosmonaut training groups were formed. One group was commanded by Vladimir Komarov and included Yuri Gagarin, and was to prepare for qualification flights of the Soyuz in Earth orbit and a Proton-launched cis-lunar mission (Gagarin, Nikolayev, Komarov, Bykovskiy, Khrunov; Engineer-Cosmonauts: Gorbatko, Grechko, Sevastyanov, Kubasov, Volkov). Komarov later died in the Soyuz 1 spaceflight when his parachute malfunctioned causing his capsule to smash into the earth at high speed. The second group was led by Alexei Leonov and concentrated on the landing mission (Commanders: Leonov, Popovich, Belyayev, Volynov, Klimuk; Engineer-cosmonauts: Makarov, Voronov, Rukavishnikov, Artyukhin). As a result, Leonov has the strongest claim to have been the Soviets' first choice for first man on the moon.  After Komarov's death in Soyuz 1 in 1967, Gagarin was taken out of training and the groups were restructured. Despite the Soyuz 1 setback, the Soviets successfully rehearsed the automated docking of two unmanned Soyuz craft in Earth orbit in 1968 and with the manned Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 joint mission in early 1969 tested the other key mission elements.  A total of 18 missions were related to the N1-L3 project. For details, see the table at the bottom of the article. Moon flyby ""UR-500K(Proton)/L1(Zond)"" program. Launched by a 3-staged Proton rocket, the L1(Zond) was a spacecraft from the Soyuz family and consisted of two or three modified modules of the main craft Soyuz 7K-OK with a total weight of 5.5 tons. The Apollo orbital spacecraft (command ship) for the lunar flyby also had two modules (command and service) but was five times heavier, carried a crew of three and entered lunar orbit, whereas the L1 (Zond) performed a flight around the Moon and came back on a return trajectory. Planned for 8 December 1968 for priority over the US, a first manned mission of the L1 (Zond) was cancelled due to insufficient readiness of the capsule and rocket. After Apollo 8 won the first (lunar flyby) phase of the Moon Race at the end of 1968, the Soviet leadership lost political interest in the L1 (Zond) program. A few reserve units of L1 (Zond) made unpiloted flights, but by the end of 1970 this program was cancelled. Moon landing ""N1/L3"" program. The final plan for a manned landing adopted the same method of single launch and lunar orbit rendezvous as the Apollo project, but had differences in some details and technical data. Despite the fact that the planned Soviet Moon expedition was carried at a single launch like Apollo, for mission safety, some two to three weeks before at least the first manned missions, an LK-R in unmanned L3 complex and two Lunokhod automated moon rovers would be sent to the Moon. They worked as radio beacons for manned LK, with the LK-R being used as a reserve ""escape"" craft to return from the Moon, and the Lunokhods were additionally equipped with manual controls for the cosmonauts for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular researches both. The N1 rocket carried the L3 Moon expedition complex that consisted of two spacecraft (LOK and LK) and two (Block G and Block D) boosters.  A variant of the Soyuz craft, the ""Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl"" (LOK) command ship, carried two men, and consisted of three modules like the regular Soyuz 7K-OK, but was heavier by a few tons. The 7K-OK was half the mass of the three-man Apollo orbital craft (command ship). The ""Lunniy Korabl"" (LK) carried one cosmonaut, so in the Soviet expedition one cosmonaut alone would land on Moon, while in Apollo two would. The mass of the LK was 40% the mass the Apollo lunar lander. The total mass of the L3 complex placed in LEO by the N1 was 93 tons compared to Saturn V's 137 tons. The total mass of the LOK and LK was 40% of the full Apollo complex, but was equivalent to the L3 complex without Block G. The booster for the LEO toward the Moon for the Apollo vehicle was provided by the last stage of the Saturn V, while for the Block D, LOK and LK, this was to be provided by Block G of the same L3 complex.  During the L3 complex's journey to the Moon, there was no need to undock and redock the orbital and landing craft as in Apollo, because the cosmonaut would transfer from the LOK to LK by a ""spacewalk"", while in Apollo this operation was executed by an internal passage.  Block D slowed the LOK and LK into lunar orbit, while in the Apollo complex this phase was undertaken by firing the engine on the service module (the Apollo complex traveled with the Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) facing back towards the Earth) to slow the complex and enter lunar orbit. Once in orbit, the LK with Block D would separate from the LOK and descend toward the surface of Moon using the Block D engine. After Block D exhausted its fuel, the LK was to separate and complete landing using its own engine.  On the Moon, the cosmonaut would undertake moonwalks on foot and by Lunokhods, collect rocks, and plant the Soviet flag.  After a few hours on the lunar surface, the LK's engine would fire again using its landing structure as a launch pad, as with Apollo. To save weight, the engine used for landing would also blast the LK back to lunar orbit for an automated docking with the LOK. The cosmonaut then would spacewalk back to the LOK carrying the Moon rock samples, with the LK being cast off. After this, the LOK would fire its rocket for the return to Earth. After the US won the final (Moon-landing) phase and the whole of the Moon Race in 1969, the justification for the Soviet lunar landing program evaporated, although development and testing continued into the early 1970s. In 1970–1971 the LK was completely ready after three unmanned test flights on LEO (Kosmos 379, Kosmos 398, Kosmos 434), and the LOK was launched once (Kosmos 382 aka 7K-L1E dummy of 7K-LOK). The Krechet lunar spacesuit and other support systems were tested.  Four N1 test launches were attempted in 1969, 1971, and 1972 and all were failures, despite engineering improvements after each crash. The second launch attempt on 3 July 1969, just 13 days prior to the launch of Apollo 11, was a catastrophic failure which destroyed both the rocket and the launch complex, and this delayed the N1-L3 program for two years more. For automatic Moon flyby, at these two first launches the N1 carried the 7K-L1S spacecraft (modified 7K-L1), while dummy 7K-LOK (7K-L1E) and regular 7K-LOK with dummy LKs at both were at third and fourth launches. Subsequently, the complete L3 lunar expedition complex with regular 7K-LOK and regular LK for Moon flyby and landing by full unmanned mission of future manned scenario was prepared for fifth launch of modified N1 rocket on August, 1974. If this and one subsequent mission had been successful, up to five Soviet manned N1-L3 expeditions would have been launched in 1976–1980.  Also, to gain technical and scientific interest in the program, the modified multi-launched N1F-L3M missions with significantly more time spent on the Moon's surface than with Apollo.  But N1-L3 (as well as N1F-L3M) program was cancelled on May, 1974, and Soviet manned space efforts subsequently concentrated on the development of space stations and on several design and ground preparatory processes for a Mars mission, which continues to the present day, but has unclear objectives.  Laterly proposed moonbase Zvezda, first detailed such project with developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules, and ""Vulkan-LEK"" project were not adopted for economic reasons. As some recompense and as a replacement for the manned landing program, the Soviets fulfilled a program of automated delivery of lunar soil and Lunokhods automated moon rovers.  The launch pad and MIK of N1 was redesigned for the Energia-Buran shuttle program. At least five LKs and three LOKs in various states of construction remain with some units being kept in the designer's and producer's company museums. Near 150 engines produced for first stages of N1F were kept by manufacturer (Kuznetsov Design Bureau) and sold for use on US launchers around the year 2000. "
wikipedia-1274827," Novak  Novák, Novak or Nowak is a surname in a number of Slavic languages, and one of the most popular surnames in many Slavic countries, namely the Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Poland. The name is derived from the Slavic word for ""new"" (e.g. ), meaning something similar to ""new man"", ""newcomer"" or ""stranger"" in English. The name was often given to someone who came to a new city, or a convert to Christianity. It was also used for newcomers into an army and as an occupational surname: people who used the slash-and-burn method to create new arable land - ""novina"". Spelling. It is usually spelled: It is pronounced almost the same way: the main difference is that in Slovene, the stress is usually on the last syllable, while in all other cases it is on the first one. Many Americans of the surname Nowak have had it Anglicized to Novak. In the Austrian capital of Vienna, where large Czech communities settled down at the end of 19th century, Novák was Germanized to Nowak because in German the ""w"" is pronounced as the Czech ""v"". Country specifics. There are two noble Nowak lines of Polish origin: In Poland, it is spelled Nowak and it is the most common surname. ""Statystyka najpopularniejszych nazwisk występujących w Polsce in 2009"" (The most popular surnames in Poland in 2009).  The archaic feminine version of the Polish version is ""Nowakowa"" and its plural ""Nowakowie"". In that country, Nowakowski, Nowacki, and Nowakiewicz developed as well. ""Nowak"" as a surname in Voivodeships (administrative units in Poland): In Croatia, Novak is the sixth most common surname. In Serbia and Montenegro, there are people that have the first name Novak. Novaković and Novakov also developed in Serbia. Novák is the most common surname in the Czech republic. Novak is the most common surname in Slovenia, too, with more than 11,000 sharing it. There are however significant variations between regions: it's very common in central Slovenia (in the regions around Ljubljana and Celje), as well as in parts of southern Slovenia and eastern Slovenia (Lower Carniola, Prekmurje). It's much less common in northern and western Slovenia; in the Goriška region on the border with Italy, it is quite rare. The rank of the surname Novak in the Slovenian statistical regions: "
wikipedia-1274833," Adverse drug reaction  An adverse drug reaction (abbreviated ADR) is an expression that describes harm associated with the use of given medications at a normal dosage during normal use. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of ""side effect"", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as ""pharmacovigilance"". An adverse drug event (abbreviated ADE) refers to any injury caused by the drug (at normal dosage and/or due to overdose) and any harm associated with the use of the drug (e.g. discontinuation of drug therapy). ADRs are a special type of ADEs. Classification. ADRs may be classified by e.g. cause and severity. Cause. Types A and B were proposed in the 1970s, and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs. Seriousness and severity. The American Food and Drug Administration defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following: Severity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question. The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" when applied to adverse events are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage. A headache is severe, if it causes intense pain. There are scales like ""visual analog scale"" that help us assess the severity. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural bleed, even a migraine may temporally fit criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above. Overall Drug Risk. While no official scale exists yet to communicate overall drug risk, the iGuard Drug Risk Rating System is a five color rating scale similar to the Homeland Security Advisory System: Location. Adverse effects may be local, i.e. limited to a certain location, or systemic, where a medication has caused adverse effects throughout the systemic circulation. For instance, some ocular antihypertensives cause systemic effects, although they are administered locally as eye drops, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation. Mechanisms. As research better explains the biochemistry of drug use, fewer ADRs are Type B and more are Type A. Common mechanisms are: Abnormal pharmacokinetics. Comorbid disease states. Various diseases, especially those that cause renal or hepatic insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug's metabolism due to disease states. Genetic factors. Abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the inherited basis for abnormal drug reactions. Phase I reactions. Inheriting abnormal alleles of cytochrome P450 can alter drug metabolism. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. Inheriting abnormal butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) may affect metabolism of drugs such as succinylcholine Phase II reactions. Inheriting abnormal N-acetyltransferase which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide. Inheriting abnormal thiopurine S-methyltransferase may affect the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Interactions with other drugs. The risk of drug interactions is increased with polypharmacy. Protein binding. These interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved. These are mainly for drugs without much first-pass liver metabolism. The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are: Some drug interactions with warfarin are due to changes in protein binding. Cytochrome P450. Patients have abnormal metabolism by cytochrome P450 due to either inheriting abnormal alleles or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. Synergistic effects. An example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the QT interval. Assessing causality. Causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the Naranjo algorithm, the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply. An ADR should not be labeled as 'certain' unless the ADR abates with a challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR.  A simple scale is available at http://annals.org/cgi/content/full/140/10/795. Assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population. Monitoring bodies. Many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the WHO runs the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and the European Union runs the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies. In Canada, the Marketed Health Products Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the surveillance of marketed health products. "
wikipedia-1274866," Valeriy Lobanovskyi  Valeriy Vasylyovych Lobanovskyi (, """" ; , ""Valeriy Vasilyevich Lobanovskiy"" ; 6 January 1939 – 13 May 2002) was a Soviet-Ukrainian football manager. He was the Master of Sports of USSR, the Distinguished Coach of USSR, and the laureate of the UEFA Ruby Order (2002). Lobanovskyi is most famous for his spells managing Dynamo Kyiv, the Ukraine national football team, and earlier the USSR national football team. In 1975 his Dynamo Kyiv team became the first side from the Soviet Union to win a major European trophy when they beat Hungarian side Ferencváros in the final of the Cup Winners' Cup. Lobanovskyi is notorious for his both highly scientific and harsh disciplinarian approach to management. Career. Playing career. Lobanovskyi is a graduate of the Kiev football school #1 and the Football School of Youth (Kiev). He began his playing career as a left winger with Dynamo Kyiv, his hometown club, whilst with the side he won both the USSR league and cup. He spent seven years with the club before finishing his career with brief spells at Chornomorets Odessa, and Shakhtar Donetsk. Lobanovskyi ended his playing career at the age of 29 having scored 71 goals in 253 games. He also earned two full caps for the Soviet Union and played in two Olympic games. Lobanovskyi played his first international game on September 4, 1960 away against Austria. He is most famous for his legendary ability to score from corner kicks and his ability to curve the ball and place it wherever he pleased; his immense fame gained from this led him to take over as a coach for Dynamo Kiev. Managerial career. A year after retiring as a player Lobanovskyi was named as the manager of FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. After four relatively unremarkable years with Dnipro, Lobanovskyi moved to his former club, Dynamo Kyiv, before the start of the 1974 season, he would manage the side for 15 of the next 17 years (he spent 1983–1984 managing the USSR). During these two spells Kyiv were successful in breaking the Russian dominance of Soviet football. Lobanovskyi led his side to the Soviet super league eight times, the cup six times, the European Cup Winners' Cup of 1975 and 1986, and European Super Cup of 1975. Lobanovskyi also spent three spells managing the Soviet Union during this period. He took the side to the bronze medal in the 1976 Summer Olympics during his first spell. However, it was his third, and last, spell with the side that he gained the most attention. He was asked to manage the side on the eve of the 1986 World Cup. The side, which consisted mainly of his own Dynamo Kyiv players, finished top of their group, but were knocked out in the second round by Belgium 4–3 after extra time. The team did, however, achieve far greater success at the 1988 European Championship. The team again finished top of their group, beating the Netherlands on the way. However, they played the Netherlands again in the final and failed to repeat their previous victory. Following perestroika many of Lobanovskyi's best players, for both club and country, left the USSR to play in Western Europe. Going into the 1990 World Cup he couldn't call upon his own Kyiv players to form the core of the side as he had previously done. His subsequent lack of ability to completely control his side led to the team finishing bottom of their group. Following the debacle of the World Cup, Lobanovskyi decided to leave Dynamo Kyiv and take up the lucrative offer of managing the United Arab Emirates national football team. After four relatively lacklustre years he was sacked and went on to spend the next two years managing the Kuwait national football team, before he was again sacked. In January 1997 Lobanovskyi returned to manage Dynamo Kyiv for a third time. The club by this time had fallen somewhat from their former heights. The club had been thrown out of European competition by UEFA following attempts to bribe an official, and the club was also struggling somewhat in the league. Lobanovskyi, however, managed to turn the club around quickly. Aside from leading the team to five consecutive championships, Lobanovskyi managed to turn the side into one of the best sides in Europe, reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League in 1999. He was made manager of the Ukraine national side in March 2000, but was sacked after the side lost a playoff to reach the 2002 World Cup to Germany. Lobanovskyi suffered a stroke on 7 May 2002, shortly after his Dynamo Kyiv side had beaten FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhya. He died on 13 May, during brain surgery, following complications suffered after the stroke. At the Champions League final in Glasgow two days later, UEFA held a minute's silence in his honour. Remembrance. Following his death Lobanovskyi was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine, the nation's highest honour. Dynamo Kyiv's stadium was also renamed the Lobanovsky Stadium in his honour. Lobanovskyi was buried at Baikove Cemetery where an impressive monument surrounds his tomb. After his death, A.C. Milan won the Champions League in 2003 with Andriy Shevchenko in the team. After the victory Shevchenko flew to Kyiv to put his medal by the grave of his former manager. In 2005 the Valeri Lobanovsky Memorial Tournament was founded. Personal life. Lobanovskyi was married to Ada Lobanovskaya, the couple had a daughter named Svitlana. She owns a restaurant in Kiev called """"U metrá"""" (). "

wikipedia-1274916," Johnny Canuck  Johnny Canuck was a Canadian cartoon hero and superhero who was created as a political cartoon in 1869 and was later re-invented, most notably as a Second World War action hero in 1942. The Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), currently use a lumberjack rendition of Johnny Canuck as one of their team logos. Political cartoon. Johnny Canuck was created as a lumberjack national personification of Canada. He first appeared in early political cartoons dating to 1869 where he was portrayed as a younger cousin of the United States' Uncle Sam and Britain's John Bull. Dressed as a habitant, farmer, logger, rancher or soldier, he was characterized as wholesome and simple-minded and was often depicted resisting the bullying of John Bull or Uncle Sam. He appeared regularly in editorial cartoons for 30 years before declining in usage in the early twentieth century. Comic book hero. The character re-emerged during World War II in the February 1942 issue of Bell Features' ""Dime Comics"" No.1. Cartoonist Leo Bachle created the character as a teenager, apparently on a challenge from a Bell executive. Initially, Johnny Canuck had no superpowers. Johnny Canuck's cartoon exploits helped Canada fight against Nazism. Like Captain America, he met Adolf Hitler and almost single-handedly ended the war.  The use of such stock figures diminished in popularity after World War II. However, in 1975, a new comic book character, Captain Canuck, emerged. Created by Richard Comely (who at the time was unaware of the earlier Johnny Canuck character), Captain Canuck was a costumed superhero rather than just a hero, and he wore red and white tights and bore a red maple leaf emblazoned on the forehead of his mask.  In 1995, Canada Post issued a series of Canadian postage stamps celebrating Canada’s comic-book superheroes. Johnny Canuck is depicted as he appeared in the comic books, dressed in flight jacket, goggles, leather headgear and boots. Johnny Canuck is linked to a tradition of stalwart, honest, upstanding Canadian heroes. Ty Templeton and Moonstone Books are currently planning to resurrect the character in a comic originally called ""Johnny Canuck and the Guardians of the Northern Lights"" and then re-titled ""The Northern Guard"" which is scheduled for release in November 2010. Vancouver Canucks. In the mid-20th century, the Vancouver Canucks, a major professional ice hockey team of the Pacific Coast Hockey League and later Western Hockey League, used a lumberjack rendition of Johnny Canuck as their logo. When the Canucks moved to the National Hockey League in 1970, they discontinued the Johnny Canuck logo in favour of the ""Stick-in-Rink"" logo. In 2006, a vintage-inspired goaltender mask worn by Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo once again featured Johnny Canuck. In the 2007 off-season, it was announced that the Canucks were designing a new uniform and it was speculated among fans and media that Johnny Canuck would officially return as a logo in some capacity. Although the character was ultimately not included, the following season, in 2007–08, Luongo's new mask once again featured Johnny Canuck, but more prominently than his previous design. Then, beginning in 2008–09, the Canucks included a stylized version of their retro WHL logo – Johnny Canuck's face overtop a ""V"" – as a shoulder patch on their third jersey. "
wikipedia-1274922," Seed saving  In agriculture and gardening, seed saving (sometimes known as brownbagging) is the practice of saving seeds or other reproductive material (e.g. tubers) from vegetables, grain, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year for annuals and nuts, tree fruits, and berries for perennials and trees. This is the traditional way farms and gardens were maintained. In recent decades, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers, and to hybridize or clone plants that do not produce seed that remains ""true to type""-retaining the parent's characteristics- from seed. Much of the grassroots seed-saving activity today is the work of home gardeners. However, it is gaining popularity among organic farmers, permaculturists and enthusiasts with cultural or environmentalist interests. Open Pollination. Open pollination is an important aspect of seed saving. Plants that reproduce through natural means tend to adapt to local conditions over time, and evolve as reliable performers, particularly in their localities, known as landraces or ""folk varieties.""The modern trend to rely on hybridized and cloned plants negates these evolutionary processes. Hybrid plants are artificially cross-pollinated, and bred to favor desirable characteristics, like higher yield (in monocultures) and more uniform size to accommodate mechanized harvesting. However, the seed produced by the second generation (F2) of the hybrid does not reliably produce a true copy of that hybrid (it 'segregates') and often loses much of its yield potential.  Loss of species. While comprehensive figures are hard to come by, one popular view today holds that thousands of varieties of vegetables and flowers are being lost, due to reliance on commercial hybrid seed. Widespread use of a relatively few mass-marketed hybrid seed varieties, in both home gardening and commercial farming, is said to be eliminating many open-pollinated varieties, especially the local variations that were naturally developed, when local seed-saving was the common practice. The concern is that this erodes the gene pool, resulting in less hardy, more vulnerable plants. Countering this trend (an environmental and sustainability issue), and an affinity for variety and tradition, are the principal motivations for many large seed-saving groups. Method. To be successful at seed saving, new skills need to be developed that enhance the capacity of growers to ensure that desired characteristics are retained in their landraces: learning the minimum number of plants to be grown which will preserve inherent genetic diversity, recognizing the preferred characteristics of the cultivar being grown so that plants that are not breeding true are selected against, understanding and promoting the breeding of improvements to the cultivar, using seed storage methods that maintain viability, learning the conditions that maximize germination, and detecting the presence of diseases that are seed-borne so that they can be eliminated. Care must be taken, as training materials regarding seed production, cleaning, storage, and maintenance often focus on making landraces more uniform, distinct and stable (usually for commercial application) which can result in the loss of valuable adaptive traits unique to local varieties (Jarvis et al., 2000). Additionally, there is a matter of localized nature to be considered. In the upper northern hemisphere, and lower southern, one sees a seasonal change in terms of a cooler winter. Many plants go-to-seed and then go dormant. These seeds must hibernate until their respective spring season. Legality. While saving seed and even exchanging seed with other farmers for biodiversity purposes has been a traditional practice, these practices have become illegal for the plant varieties that are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation). Under Article 28 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement), ""planting, harvesting, saving, re-planting, and exchanging seeds of patented plants, or of plants containing patented cells and genes, constitutes use"" and is prohibited by the intellectual property laws of signatory states. Significantly, farmers in developing countries are particularly affected by prohibitions on seed saving. There are some protections for re-use, called ""farmer's privilege"", in the 1991 International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention), but seed exchange remains prohibited. In the United States, by contrast, the farmer's privilege is considered protected by the Plant Variety Protection Act and by case law stemming from ""Asgrow Seed v. Winterboer"". American farmers may sell seed up to the amount saved for replanting their own acreage. ""Diamond v. Chakrabarty"" established that companies may obtain patents for life-forms. ""J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer"" established that seed saving is a patent violation. References. Jarvis, D., B. Sthapit, and L. Sears (eds.). 2000.

wikipedia-1274955," Congregational Christian Churches  The Congregational Christian Churches were a Protestant Christian denomination that operated in the U.S. from 1931 through 1957. On the latter date, most of its churches joined the Evangelical and Reformed Church in a merger to become the United Church of Christ. Others created the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches. During the forementioned period, its churches were organized nationally into a General Council, with parallel state conferences, sectional associations, and missionary instrumentalities. Congregations, however, retained their local autonomy and these groups were legally separate from the congregations. The body came into being in Seattle, Washington in 1931 by the merger of two American bodies that practiced congregational church governance, the General Council of Congregational Churches and the General Convention of the Christian Church. Initially using the word ""and"" between the words ""Congregational"" and ""Christian,"" the new denomination decided to combine the predecessor churches' identities into one nationally, while its constituent churches remained free to either retain their original names or adopt the new usage. Heritages. Congregationalism. Established by settlers in present-day New England fleeing religious persecution in their native England, the Congregational churches were identified with the Puritan theological and political perspective within Anglo-Saxon Protestantism during the 17th century. Many American historians have viewed their semi-democratic practices as laying the foundation for the representative nature of the U.S. political tradition. Although they were originally strongly Calvinist in the 18th century, eventually, by the 19th century, Congregationalists had accepted their peculiar vocation in U.S. religious life, maintaining a broadly orthodox faith while cultivating a passion for freedom, equality, and justice. These ethical convictions would propel the Congregational churches into the forefront of social reform movements during the next 150 years or so. Most notable of these was strong support for the abolition of slavery among African-Americans in the Southern U.S. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, numerous pastors and female schoolteacher missionaries, working under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, established academies, colleges, and churches for the freedpeople; six of the colleges are still in existence. Yet later generations became involved in causes such as temperance, women's suffrage, and the Social Gospel. In the midst of all the political involvement, Congregationalists held firmly to the notion that each local church was ruled directly by Jesus Christ, as testified to in the Bible and preached to those convicted by the Holy Spirit, and thus constituted a spiritual republic unto itself, needing no authorization from outside ecclesiastical forces.  On the homefront, Congregationalism became primarily a grouping found among townspeople and affluent urban residents of New England, New York state, the Great Lakes region, portions of the Great Plains, and the Pacific Coast; roughly speaking, the Northern United States. By the turn of the 20th century, the churches had begun to attract worshipers from outside their original base constituency of English-speaking Anglo-Americans. Immigrant groups that formed Congregational churches included Volga Germans, Swedes, Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiians. The Congregational churches also acquired two smaller church bodies: several Congregational Methodist churches in Alabama and Georgia, during the 1890s, and the Evangelical Protestant Churches, a German-immigrant group located primarily in and around Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, in 1925. Theologically, the Congregationalists spent much of the 19th century moving from orthodox Reformed concepts and teachings (e.g., total depravity, limited atonement) toward a decidedly more liberal orientation, facilitated by a group of Yale University-educated pastors in and around the time of the Civil War. Led by the likes of Horace Bushnell and Nathaniel Taylor, the New Divinity men broke, some would say irrevocably, with the older pessimistic views of human nature espoused by classical Congregationalist divines such as Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, declaring instead a more sanguine view of possibilities for the individual and society. Even as this grand shift may have attracted individuals weary of overbearing, harsh harangues from generations of revivalist preachers, numerous others deplored what they felt was an abandonment of the true faith; these conservatives increasingly sought refuge in more doctrinally rigid churches such as the Baptists and the Presbyterians, especially outside New England.  The losses to Presbyterianism increased greatly in the decades in which the ""Plan of Union,"" designed by Connecticut Congregationalists and the Presbyterian General Assembly to avoid duplication of effort in evangelizing the frontier regions, was in effect, as numerous Congregational-founded parishes were annexed to presbyteries, usually through the pastor's affiliation and often without the local church's assent. The need to dissolve that failed attempt at interdenominationalism, which had already taken place among the Presbyterians, prompted the first national gathering of Congregationalists since the 1648 synod that produced the Cambridge Platform, a confession of faith similar to the Presbyterians' Westminster Confession, at Boston in 1865. It was not until 1870, though, that a sufficient number of Congregationalists responded to a call to organize nationally.  This was not the first time American Congregationalism had been shaken to its foundations by theological change; the Great Awakenings of the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century had also left indelible marks upon the churches. Some churches openly embraced revivalism, while others, particularly in the Boston area, reacted negatively to the developments by adopting Arminian viewpoints in opposition to the intensified Calvinism espoused by preachers such as Edwards and George Whitefield. Many of the liberalized congregations would eventually depart the Congregational fellowship in 1825 to form the American Unitarian Association; this body is now known as the Unitarian Universalist Association. Meanwhile, despite the cherished commitments to independence and freedom, Congregationalists moved increasingly in the direction of espousing the main aims of the ecumenical movement within American (and world) Protestantism, a movement gathering much energy from the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe and a perceived decline in religious life among Americans during the first third of the 20th century. These impulses led Congregational leaders to pursue close relations with numerous Protestant groups, but one group emerged as a prime candidate for actual organizational union: the Christian Churches. The Christian Churches (""Connection""). While Puritans were consolidating their domination of religious, political and intellectual life in New England, elsewhere in America, during the period immediately before the American Revolution, many newly-arrived settlers became dissatisfied with theology, preaching, liturgy, and ecclesiology inherited from Europe. Many of these people had turned to revivalist faiths such as the Methodists and the Baptists, and most found spiritual homes within those groups, or others deriving from the ferment started by the Great Awakenings. However, several preachers led, in different parts of the country, dissenting movements against the leadership of some of those churches. In the 1790s, a Methodist pastor serving churches in central North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, James O'Kelly, took exception to the development of an episcopacy within his church. He felt that the rise of bishops, strongly advocated by the likes of Francis Asbury, would approximate the powers of the recently-disestablished Anglican church and thus unduly control the ministry, particularly through the practice of itinerancy. When leaders ignored O'Kelly's protests, he and some sympathizers withdrew from the Methodist Church to form a body originally known as the ""Republican Methodist Church."" Upon extensive discussion and prayer, O'Kelly began to hold that the name implied a sectarianism that was quite at odds with what he felt were prescriptions from the New Testament prohibiting churches from identifying with mere human opinions. Thus, he and others arrived at the notion that their churches should simply bear the name of ""Christian."" Several hundred miles to the north in Vermont, a Baptist preacher by the name of Abner Jones began to refute the then-prevalent Calvinist dogmas within his fellowship. He led some of his followers out of his congregation into a new fellowship founded upon a platform similar to O'Kelly's, with a strong emphasis upon open communion and freedom of conscience. Later in the first decade of the 19th century, he and a New Hampshire pastor began publishing a newspaper for the movement, ""Herald of Gospel Liberty,"" reputed by some historians to have been the first general-interest religious periodical in the U.S. The movement progressed throughout New England, especially within those two states, as well as Maine and Massachusetts. Ironically given the Christian Connection's later history, the churches were treated, in the main, in a hostile fashion by adherents of the Congregational ""Standing Order."" Both movements were restorationist in outlook, and influenced the later Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. That later movement produced several larger groups still in existence today: the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ. The geographically disparate Northern and Southern wings of the Christian movement did eventually discover each other, and they formed a convention in 1820, at which time a general list of five (some scholars have claimed six) principles unifying the otherwise diverse congregations were agreed upon. The unity, unfortunately, did not survive engrossing controversies over slavery and the ensuing Civil War, and the ""Christian Connection,"" as was the case with American Protestant groups such as the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists, split once again into Northern and Southern factions. This was largely precipitated by the Northern group, many of whose leaders, much in the same vein as the Congregationalists, made strong denunciations of slavery. The Northerners used the schism as an occasion to legally assume denominational form, in 1850. Despite the bitterness of the split, Christians in both sections reunited much sooner than the other separated groups, forming the General Convention of the Christian Church in 1890.  Many Southern/O'Kelly Christians owned slaves, some of whom formed churches of their own in that tradition after the Emancipation Proclamation. Centered in central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, African-American Christian congregations formed a convention of their own in the 1890s, a body that existed until 1950, well after the Congregational Christian merger, when it joined the Convention of the South, heretofore composed of Congregational churches founded by the American Missionary Association. Theologically, the Christian Churches did not encourage a highly elaborate system of doctrine or Biblical interpretation; relatively few of their ministers had educations past the elementary grades, a circumstance that persisted well into the early 20th century. Their leanings were toward revivalist Wesleyanism, emphasizing traditional evangelical themes such as regeneration, acceptance of personal salvation, and the performance of good works of charity. Few if any of their members were inherently predisposed toward polemical attacks upon other traditions, although some pastors and churches would eventually identify with the emerging fundamentalist movement in later decades. By the time that the Congregationalists had approached Christian leaders about possible union, some disaffected adherents of the wing of Restoration Movement led by Barton Stone and Alexander Campbell had joined the Christian Connection. This group gave the movement a geographical complexion that entailed pockets of strength in New England, upstate New York, southeastern Virginia, central and eastern North Carolina, western Georgia, eastern Alabama, southwestern Ohio, and eastern Indiana, with dispersed congregations in parts of the Great Plains. Most of the membership was rural, outside major cities, usually engaged in farming or similar occupations. The Christians founded schools such as Ohio's Defiance College and Antioch College and North Carolina's Elon University; during the early 20th century, an academy and seminary for African-Americans operated in Franklinton, North Carolina. Defiance and Elon continue to relate to the United Church of Christ today. Early Post-Merger Years. After the 1931 merger, relatively few practices and customs changed drastically within either of the uniting traditions, largely because its members, like most Americans, were overwhelmed by, first, the Great Depression, and, later, World War II. It would not be until after the latter concluded that the CC churches would embark on anything like a major church extension program; this was the case, of course, with most U.S. denominations during this period, as their churches often struggled to merely stay open, with little or nothing left over for mission work. Congregationalists constituted about 85-90% of the membership of the new denomination; this caused few if any resentments or conflicts because, by and large, the two groups did not overlap each other geographically, except in parts of New England, upstate New York, Ohio, and among African-American churches in North Carolina. Regional judicatories and national domestic and foreign mission agencies merged quite smoothly, often continuing to use varying terminologies (e.g., ""convention,"" ""conference,"" ""association""), depending on custom. On the domestic front, most of the new church planting efforts were concentrated in newly developing areas such as southern California, Arizona, Florida, and suburbs of major Midwestern cities (e.g., Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis). Abroad, many CC missionary efforts shifted their emphases toward medical and social services, particularly after many of the churches Congregationalists had founded in earlier decades had formed autonomous bodies of their own. One distinguishing trait of the new fellowship, aside from its unusually tolerant attitude regarding subscription to ancient doctrines, was its bold enthusiasm for ecumenical adventures, especially those growing out of the ""Faith and Order"" and ""Life and Work"" inter-church initiatives in Great Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. These developments and others led to the founding of the World Council of Churches in 1948, of which the Congregational Christian Churches was a charter member. In the U.S., the Congregational Christians made several overtures to other Protestant groups toward federative unions and/or organic mergers in the years before World War II. But the main legacy of those discussions was what became the United Church of Christ in 1957. UCC Merger Talks. The Rev. Dr. Truman Douglass, pastor of St. Louis' Pilgrim Congregational Church, met with the Rev. Dr. Samuel Press, president of Eden Theological Seminary in that city, a seminary of the Evangelical and Reformed Church, a denomination predominantly of German origin and itself a merger of two previously separated traditions, as part of an informal interchurch discussion group in 1937. Douglass' and Press' talks led to the involvement of both bodies in proposals to consider organic union, work that eventually culminated in the Basis of Union in 1943, which both national bodies approved after a five-year period of revising. The Rev. Dr. Douglas Horton, a former Harvard Divinity School president, had become the CC general minister and president by this point, and became the prime figure in the CC union efforts. ""Continuing Congregationalism"". However, a small but vocal minority of ministers and laymen protested the developments, charging that any merger with a confessional, presbyterial body such as the E&R Church would destroy the heritage and structure of American Congregationalism. These opponents formed groups that published pamphlets and attempted to persuade churches to reject the proposed merger. An anti-merger congregation in Brooklyn filed suit against the CC moderator, Helen Kenyon, in 1949 to legally stop the merger proceedings; the major legal contention made by the church and the anti-union advocates was that the CC General Council possessed no authority to enter into a merger as a national entity. After some initial victories in lower courts, a New York state Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction and judged in favor of Ms. Kenyon and the CC Churches in 1953. With this defeat, the anti-merger forces turned instead toward forming a new denomination, which became the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, founded in 1955; a preponderance of these churches were located in non-metropolitan New England, southeastern Michigan, parts of Wisconsin and Illinois, and southern California. Some years before that, motivated by different concerns, chiefly doctrine, a group of evangelical-leaning congregations formed the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, in 1948. Union Approved. The final vote on CC participation in the UCC merger took place at the 1956 General Council, meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Eighty-eight (88) percent of the delegates approved the motion to unite with the Evangelical and Reformed Church, and the latter body's General Synod approved by an even wider margin. This set the stage for the Uniting General Synod, which took place in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 25, 1957; the CC Churches were represented by the Rev. Fred Hoskins, who had succeeded Horton some years earlier as general minister and president. Hoskins would become, along with E&R President James Wagner, one of the co-presidents of the UCC. The actual consummation of the UCC, however, did not occur until 1961, when a sufficient number of CC congregations voted to approve the denomination's new constitution. The CC Churches brought into the new UCC approximately 1.4 million members, about 60 percent of the total number of members in the new denomination. In order to attend to necessary legal business continuing from years past, the General Council remained incorporated until 1984, when it finally dissolved. Sources.

wikipedia-1274964," Open pollination  Open pollination is pollination by insects, birds, wind, or other natural mechanisms, and contrasts with cleistogamy, closed pollination, which is one of the many types of self pollination. Open pollination also contrasts with controlled pollination, a procedure used to ensure that all seeds of a crop are descended from parents with known traits, and are therefore more likely to have the desired traits. The seeds of open-pollinated plants will produce new generations of those plants; however, because breeding is uncontrolled and the pollen (male parent) source is unknown, open pollination may result in plants that vary widely in genetic traits. Open pollination may increase biodiversity. Some plants (such as many crops) are primarily self pollenizing and also breed true, so that even under open pollination conditions the next generation will be (almost) the same. Even among true breeding organisms, some variation due to genetic recombination or to mutation can produce a few ""off types"". One of the bigger challenges in maintaining a strain by open pollination is avoiding introduction of pollen from other strains. Based on how broadly the pollen for the plant tends to disperse, it can be controlled to varying degrees by greenhouses, tall wall enclosures, or field isolation. Popular examples of plants produced under open pollination conditions include heirloom tomatoes. Relationship to hybrid inbred lines. Hybrid pollination, a type of controlled pollination in which the pollen comes from a different strain (or species), can be used to increase crop suitability, especially through heterosis. The resulting hybrid strain can sometimes be inbred and selected for desired traits until a strain that breeds true by open pollination is achieved. The result is referred to as a inbred hybrid strain. To add some confusion, the term hybrid inbred applies to hybrids that are made from selected inbred lines that have certain desired characteristics (see inbreeding). The latter type of hybrid is sometimes designated F1 hybrid, i.e. the first hybrid (filial) generation whose parents were (different) inbred lines. "
wikipedia-1275028," Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha  Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case ruling in 1983 that the one-house legislative veto violated the constitutional separation of powers. Background. State of law. § 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, , authorized the INS to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the Attorney General, in his discretion, found that ""deportation would ... result in extreme hardship."" After such a finding by the Attorney General, he transmits a report to Congress pursuant to § 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress has the power to veto the Attorney General's determination pursuant to § 244(c)(2). Facts of case. Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in Kenya to Indian parents, but neither Kenya nor India recognized him as a legitimate citizen or resident. He held a British passport and traveled to Ohio as a foreign exchange student. After his non-immigrant student visa expired, neither Kenya nor the U.K. would accept him onto its territory. The INS initiated deportation proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to § 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to § 244(c)(2). The House of Representatives vetoed the suspension of Chadha's deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found he lacked any authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found § 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the Attorney General to suspend deportation proceedings. INS appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2).  Congress argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the United States Supreme Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision. Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from § 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating § 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in § 244(a)(1) will also be destroyed, and there will be no relief possible. (2) The Court does not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it. (3) The action is not a genuine case or controversy, as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenge the statute without real opposition. (4) The action is a non-justiciable political question. Holding. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment. It held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination is constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a legislative veto over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the bicameralism principle and Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court rebutted Congress's assertions as follows: (1) § 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause § 406. The legislative history of § 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing private laws to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as ""amici curiae"". (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts.  The Court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process—especially the President's veto power—was intended by the Framers to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action; it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Other opinions. Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress's action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress's action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the anti-aggrandizement principle) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the Bill of Attainder Clause, Art. I, § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial.  Justice White, dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the War Powers Act of 1973. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the Court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the president, but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The Court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the ""status quo"" situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause. Justice Rehnquist, in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated § 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of §§ 244(c)(1–2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other. Later history. Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living near San Francisco as of June 1985. Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after ""Chadha"", although various presidents have issued executive signing statements disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the War Powers Act, for example, while contested by every president since Richard M. Nixon, are usually grudgingly obeyed. Other processes, such as fast-track legislation, have taken the place of the legislative veto and achieved the same effects. The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. Sections 801-808, allowed Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations. Such a veto has been exercised only once, in March 2001, when Republicans in both houses of Congress passed a Joint Resolution of Disapproval to invalidate an OSHA regulation regarding musculoskeletal disorders.

wikipedia-1275106," A. A. Allen  Asa A. Allen (March 27, 1911, in Sulphur Rock, Arkansas - June 11, 1970, in San Francisco), better known as A. A. Allen, was a controversial evangelist with a Pentecostal healing and deliverance ministry. He was, for a time, associated with the ""Voice of Healing"" movement founded by Gordon Lindsay. He died at the age of 59 in San Francisco. Allen was buried at his ministry headquarters in Miracle Valley, Arizona. Early life. Asa A. Allen's early life was lived in an often unpleasant environment. His family was very poor, and his father was an alcoholic. At the age of 23, Allen became a Christian at the Onward Methodist Church in Miller, Missouri. Later, he learned of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit from a Pentecostal preacher who was conducting meetings in his home. He soon felt the call to preach and affiliated himself with the Assemblies of God, and subsequently obtained ordination from them in 1936. He then began to pastor a small church in Colorado. By 1947, Allen was pastoring a large A/G church in Corpus Christi, Texas. After attending an Oral Roberts tent meeting in Dallas (1949), Allen testified that as he left that meeting he hoped to form a healing ministry and asked his church board to allow him to start a radio program. They refused. Allen soon resigned from his church and began holding healing revival meetings. Revivalist. Stemming in part from purported healings, he established a large following. Allen became one of the first to develop a national television ministry. His television programs frequently included excerpts from his ""healing line"" ministry. By the late 1960s, however, music formed an increasingly dominant part of his programs, with that music generally being performed by African-American singer and choir leader Gene Martin. In 1955, Allen purchased a large tent for $8,500. Allen was soon one of the major healing evangelists on the revival circuit. Allen’s revival meetings were similar to the other leading evangelists of the time (such as Jack Coe, Oral Roberts, and William Branham) in that meetings were typically characterized by preaching, testifying, music, and praying for those in need of healing. As was the case with other ministers of the time, Allen's healing ministry was facilitated by the use of ""prayer cards"" obtained in advance by those requesting prayer for healing.  Allen was arrested in 1955 for suspicion of drunk driving after a controversial incident in Knoxville, Tennessee. Allen resigned from the Assemblies of God shortly afterward. After paying the fine without contest in order to avoid terminating his Knoxville meetings which were then in progress, Allen was re-ordained by his ""Miracle Revival Fellowship."" Allen's associate Don Stewart claimed that Allen was occasionally drunk after Knoxville, and that his staff covered for him,  Allen continued on the revival circuit, and in 1958 he purchased a tent that could seat over 22,000 (the tent was the one used by evangelist Jack Coe up until his death in 1956). Allen became one of the first evangelists to call poverty a spirit and believed in God's ability to perform miracles financially. At his peak, he appeared on fifty-eight radio stations daily as well as forty-three TV stations. At the time of his death, his Arizona headquarters was with its own airfield.  At that time, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. was publishing ""well over"" 60 million pieces of literature a year. The circulation of ""Miracle Magazine,"" published monthly by the Allen ministry, was 450,000 at the time of his death. The magazine included, at times, accounts of healings, but gave a disclaimer that the magazine does not ""assume legal responsibility"" of its accuracy. Gerald W. King, business manager of Miracle Valley, was quoted in 1969, shortly before Allen's death, as saying ""We take in $2 million a year, and our expenses are $2 million a year."" He added that Miracle Valley's annual payroll was $84,000. Few of his supposed miracles ever underwent ""scrutiny of physicians"" and at his revivals in small print his disclaimer read: ""A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. assumes no legal responsibility for the veracity of any such report."" One source, ""The Encyclopedia of American Religions"", claims that Allen did not like press coverage and that this ""resulted in his hiring of 'goon squads' to punch out anyone who showed up for Allen's tent revivals with a notepad or camera."" Eventually, most of the evangelists had wheelchairs available for people who had bad backs and couldn't stand in a healing line for hours. But when the evangelist got to them and pulled them up out of the wheelchair, some in the audience thought they were walking for the first time or that they had come to the revival in that wheelchair.  In his television programs, Allen or his ministry associates made frequent mention of the fact that his meetings were racially integrated. African-Americans sat alongside whites in the choir, the ministers' section, and the congregation. African-American musical talent was frequently highlighted in Allen's television programs, especially in the 1960s. This racial attitude also found its expression in Allen's sermon record album titled ""Did God Call the Apostle Paul to Preach the Gospel to the Black Man?"" The album cover refers to Allen as ""no doubt the first evangelist on a great national or international scale to preach integration to huge crowds in the North and the South . . . ."" This was something of an exaggeration, though perhaps in keeping with Allen's personality. The far more mainstream revivalist Billy Graham, while not always consistent, had desegregated many of his revivals as early as 1953 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and integrated all his revivals following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. Another major theme in Allen's ministry was his unrelenting attacks on what he characterized as dead, formal, denominational religion. This was a theme of a number of his televised messages and of such Miracle Valley publications as Allen's book titled ""Let My People Go!"" This was also the theme of a book authored by Clarence G. Mitchell and published by Allen's ministry, titled ""Starving Sheep and Overfed Shepherds"" (1963). Allen regarded ""denominationalism"" as a sin. This is reflected in the subtitle of Mitchell's book: ""Takes the Cover Off! Brings the Sin of Denominationalism Out into the Open!"" At a revival meeting on January 1, 1958, at Phoenix, Arizona, Urbane Leiendecker, a recent convert, approached Allen and offered him 1280 acres (5.2 km²) of land in Arizona. This property, later expanded, was then named ""Miracle Valley."" As such, it served as the ministry headquarters for A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. This location housed Miracle Valley Bible College and its dorms and classrooms, a domed church, administrative buildings, a large warehouse, a residential neighborhood called Miracle Valley Estates, a publishing and printing plant, a four-press phonograph record plant, and Miracle Valley Fellowship, which served as a ministerial fellowship with about 10,000 ministers as members. In spite of the presence of its own print shop, however, Miracle Valley's business manager Gerald King said in 1969 that the ministry spent $27,000 per month ""farming out"" jobs to other print shops that could not be handled on site. Allen and his wife Lexie E. (Scriven) Allen divorced in 1967. They had four children. One of them, Paul Asa Allen, is the author of ""In the Shadow of Greatness - Growing Up Allen"". In 1963, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. successfully sued the Internal Revenue Service in an attempt to get the government to refund collections of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes for 1958-59. Death. Allen died at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco, California on June 11, 1970, at the age of 59. Allen died after a heavy drinking binge. Don Stewart, his successor, is said to have ""attempted to clean up evidence of his mentor's alcoholic binge in a San Francisco hotel before the police arrived."" Stewart says he wasn't trying to cover up anything, but was trying to protect Allen. Nonetheless, the claim is made that police found his body in a ""room strewn with pills and empty liquor bottles."" Following a 12-day investigation and an autopsy, the coroner's report concluded Allen died from liver failure brought on by acute alcoholism. The coroner reported that when Allen died he had a blood alcohol content of .36, which was ""enough to ensure a deep coma"". Allen was buried at Miracle Valley, Arizona on June 15, 1970. Legacy and property. In 1970, after Allen died, Reverend Don Stewart gained possession of Allen's organization, including his Miracle Valley property, and renamed Allen's Miracle Life Fellowship International to Don Stewart Evangelistic Association (and later the Don Stewart Association). Stewart ""went from pounding tent stakes at Allen's revivals to driving a truck to preaching"". In addition, Stewart ""was hit with allegations of embezzlement by Allen's brother-in-law, of pocketing offerings from the revivals"" in the wake of Allen's death. Nonetheless, the activities of the association were then moved to Phoenix and the Bible college continued to operate in Miracle Valley until 1975. Stewart then leased the campus to the Hispanic Assemblies by a 20-year lease agreement for one dollar a year. They opened a Spanish-speaking Bible college known as the Southern Arizona Bible College.  In 1979 Miracle Valley came to a close after bankruptcy hearings. For the next three years, nearly 300 members of a group led by Frances Thomas isolated themselves professing what locals said was an ""anti-white doctrine."" Immigrants from Chicago and Mississippi rioted, which resulted in the death of Therial Davis, a six-year-old. In 1982, the group had several confrontations with utility workers, neighbors and eventually law enforcement resulting in an November shoot out, during which two members of the church and a deputy were killed. That September Miracle Valley's main administration building and vast warehouse were set fire by arson, which resulted in the total destruction of the facilities. The main building was valued at $2 million. Stewart sent multiple donation requests to some people on his 100,000 person mailing list ""even though his ministry is not associated with the college and the fire damage was insured."" According to the press, one of his letters ""gave the impression ... the fire had crippled Stewart's ministry"" and another purported to include the building's ashes with a request for $200 donations. His church had issues over Stewart's financing and ""questioned Stewart's fundraising techniques"" before. In addition, Stewart was accused by his church of arson, something Stewart denies. The insurance company paid 1.5 million dollars for the reconstruction of the large building, or one million dollars for a ""cash-out."" Stewart was not interested in rebuilding and intended to take the cash-out; however, the Spanish Assemblies of God (Central Latin American District Council of the Assemblies of God) wanted the facilities to be rebuilt. Subsequently, Stewart accepted the insurance money of one million dollars for Miracle Valley, and the Assemblies of God would receive the Miracle Valley campus consisting of 15 buildings and nearly of land for six dollars, which equated into the one dollar per year for the previous six years.  However, Don Stewart forced the Assemblies of God to maintain a Bible College for a minimum of twenty years, or the property would revert to his ministry. In 1995, exactly twenty years later, the Assemblies of God closed Southern Arizona Bible College and put the campus up for sale.  In 1998, a group of ten people with Melvin Harter came from Ohio to view the campus. The next year, Miracle Valley Bible College was purchased by Harter Ministries in August 1999 and the school continued under the administration of Melvin Harter as the Miracle Valley Bible College & Seminary where students were taught in classical Pentecostal theology. However, in January 2009 a Phoenix based mortgage firm foreclosed on the property, which currently contains several dilapidated buildings. Before the previous owner left the property, the entire north section of Sanctuary roof was removed for an unknown reason. Canadian family Gilles, Diane & Michael Langevin, have opened escrow on October 31 and on December 20, 2011, their purchase was approved by the State of Arizona. They are a non-denominational ministry called Miracle Valley Arizona Ministries.[http://www.miraclevalleyarizona.com] Bibliography. The following is a partial list of books, all by A. A.

wikipedia-1275119," Germ plasm  Germ plasm or polar plasm is a zone found in the cytoplasm of the egg cells of some model organisms (such as ""Caenorhabditis elegans"", ""Drosophila melanogaster"", ""Xenopus laevis""), which contains determinants that will give rise to the germ cell lineage. As the zygote undergoes mitotic divisions the germ plasm is ultimately restricted to a few cells of the embryo. These germ cells then migrate to the gonads.  Germ plasm theory. The term ""germ plasm"" was first used by the German biologist August Weismann (1834–1914). His germ plasm theory states that multicellular organisms consist of germ cells that contain and transmit heritable information, and somatic cells which carry out ordinary bodily functions. In the germ plasm theory, inheritance in a multicellular organism only takes place by means of the germ cells: the gametes, such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body do not function as agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells, and more germ cells; the germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. This is referred to as the Weismann barrier. This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. The part of Weismann's theory which proved most vulnerable was his notion that the germ plasm (effectively, genes) were successively reduced during division of somatic cells. As modern genetics developed, it became clear that this idea was quite wrong. Cases such as Dolly (the famous cloned ewe) which, via somatic cell nuclear transfer, proved that adult cells retain a complete set of information – as opposed to Weismann's increasingly determined gradual loss of genetic information – putting this aspect of Weismann's theory to rest. The idea was to some extent anticipated in an 1865 article by Francis Galton, published in ""Macmillan's Magazine"", which set out a weak version of the concept. In 1889 Weismann wrote to acknowledge that ""You have exposed in your paper an idea which is in one essential point nearly allied to the main idea contained in my theory of the continuity of germ-plasm"".

wikipedia-1275156," Carlos Arias Navarro  Don Carlos Arias Navarro, 1st Marquis of Arias-Navarro, Grandee of Spain, born Carlos Arias y Navarro (11 December 1908 – 27 November 1989) was one of the best known Spanish politicians during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.  Arias served in the Ministry of Justice since 1929 as attorney in Málaga and Madrid. Arias was close to the right-wing sectors and joined the Francoist side during the Spanish Civil War. He was public prosecutor in the trials set up by the triumphant rightists against true or perceived sympathizers of the Republican side.  He married María de la Luz del Valle y Menéndez, without issue. After serving in various positions, including Mayor of Madrid from 1965 to June 1973, Arias became Minister of Governance in June 1973. After the assassination of the Prime Minister (""Presidente del Gobierno"") Luis Carrero Blanco he was appointed to that office as the 71st on December 31, 1973, a position he continued to hold after the death of Franco. Carlos Arias Navarro had the support of the Franco family, most notably Carmen Polo, and retained the post during the transition to democracy. However, the garroting of the Catalan anarchist Salvador Puig Antich in March 1974 had already shown his aversion to political liberalization, while other events, including the executions in September 1974, the organization of the Green March in November 1975 by King Hassan II of Morocco, and the illness and death of Franco (which Arias announced on television), displayed his weaknesses and further eroded his authority. Franco's successor as head of state, King Juan Carlos I, continued his appointment, so that it was his government (which included Manuel Fraga Iribarne and José María de Areilza) that instituted the first reforms, however unwillingly. Seeing himself as Franco's political heir, he tried to continue the late dictator's policies, opposing any change. After a lengthy power struggle, this led to his dismissal by Juan Carlos I, with Arias resigning on 1 July 1976. The next day, he was granted the hereditary title of ""marqués de Arias Navarro"" (English: Marquis of Arias Navarro), together with the dignity Grande de España (English: Grandee of Spain). Since he had no heirs, his title became extinct after he died. Arias was succeeded by Adolfo Suárez, named general secretary of the Francoist official party ""Movimiento Nacional"" in December 1975. In June 1977, during the first free general elections held since 1936, Arias integrated the ""Alianza Popular"", a right-wing party created by Manuel Fraga. He then led the Búnker group of hard-liners opposed to any reforms, along with the leader of the Francoist party ""Fuerza Nueva"", Blas Piñar. Arias, however, never again occupied a relevant position in the later Spanish government. Both left and extreme right attacked him, calling him by the nickname ""The Old Pusillanimous"". Spain and Portugal. According to the Spanish daily ""El País"", files released by the US National Archives and Records Administration show that, following the left-wing Carnation Revolution coup in Portugal on 25 April 1974, Arias met with the United States Deputy Secretary of State Robert S. Ingersoll in March 1975 and offered to invade Portugal in order to stop the spread of Communism. The report Ingersoll forwarded to the then-Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on 18 March, stated that ""appropriate steps"" were being taken to ensure that ""the events in Portugal did not cross the border into Spain."" Ingersoll went on to add that Spain wanted Washington to support Spain in the event of war, precisely at a time when the US was renegotiating the status of its military bases, and Arias wanted Washington to support Spain's future membership of NATO.

wikipedia-1275160," Wiener Werkstätte  Established in 1903, the Wiener Werkstätte (engl.: ""Vienna's Workshops"") was a production community of visual artists in Vienna, Austria bringing together architects, artists and designers.  Origins. The enterprise evolved from the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 as a progressive alliance of artists and designers. From the start, the Secession had placed special emphasis on the applied arts, and its 1900 exhibition surveying the work of contemporary European design workshops prompted the young architect Josef Hoffmann and his artist friend Koloman Moser to consider establishing a similar enterprise. Finally in 1903, with backing from the industrialist Fritz Wärndorfer, the Wiener Werkstätte began operations in three small rooms; it soon expanded to fill a three-story building with separate, specially designed facilities for metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, woodworking and a paint shop. The range of product lines also included; leather goods, enamel, jewellery, postcards and ceramics. The Wiener Werkstätte even had a millinery department. Production. Most of the objects produced in the Wiener Werkstatte were stamped with a number of different marks; the trademark of the Wiener Werkstatte, the monogram of the designer and that of the craftsman, who created it. The Wiener Werkstatte had about 100 employees in 1905, of whom 37 were masters of their trade.  The seat of the venture was in Neustiftgasse 32-34, where a new building was adapted to their requirements. Eventually the project exhausted Wärndorfer's fortune. The circle of customers of the Wiener Werkstatte and Josef Hoffmann mainly consisted of artists and Jewish upper middle class supporters of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Several branches of the workshop were opened in Karlsbad 1909, Marienbad, Zürich 1916/17, New York 1922, Berlin 1929.  In architectural commissions such as the Purkersdorf Sanatorium and the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, the Wiener Werkstätte was able to realize its ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), a coordinated environment in which everything down to the last detail was consciously designed as an integral part of the whole project. For several years, beginning in 1904, the Wiener Werkstätte had its own carpentry workshop. Josef Hoffmann designed a furniture line noted for its simple forms for the firm of Jacob & Josef Kohn. But only few pieces of furniture were made there. Most of the furniture known as Wiener Werkstätte Furniture were made by cabinet-makers as: Portois & Fix, Johann Soulek, Anton Herrgesell, Anton Pospisil, Friedrich Otto Schmidt and Johann Niedermoser. Some historians now believe that there are no existing original products of the Wiener Werkstätte Furniture division.  From 1905, the Wiener Werkstatte produced handpainted and printed silks. The Backhausen firm was responsible for the machine-printed and woven textiles. In 1907, the Wiener Werkstätte took over distribution for the Wiener Keramik, a ceramics workshop headed by Michael Powolny and Berthold Löffler. And in the same year Moser, embittered by the financial squabbling, left the Wiener Werkstätte, which subsequently entered a new phase, both stylistically and economically. Expansion. The founding of textile and fashion divisions in 1909 and 1910 brought a further shift in the Wiener Werkstätte's emphasis—away from the architectural and toward the ephemeral. After a close brush with bankruptcy in 1913, Wärndorfer left to America and the following year Otto Primavesi, a banker from Moravia, took over as chief financier and patron.  During and immediately following the First World War the Wiener Werkstatte was influenced by a new generation of artists and craftsmen. It was Dagobert Peche whose ornamental, almost baroque fancies exerted the most palpable influence.  After the war, material shortages encouraged experimentation with less durable, less expensive materials such as wood, ceramics and papier-mâché. The original, grand Gesamtkunstwerk vision became diluted and submerged by the Kunstgewerbliches—the artsy-craftsy. Attempts to expand the workshop's scope—adding such items as wallpaper to its limited program of industrial licenses, and establishing branches in Berlin, New York and Zurich—were not particularly successful. The Werkstätte's financial situation grew desperate due to the effects of the war and the onset of the world wide Depression in 1929.

wikipedia-1275172," Massagetae  The Massageteans or (; ) were an Iranian nomadic confederation in antiquity known primarily from the writings of Herodotus.  Name. About the origin of the name Massagetae, scholars have emphasized that: Weer Rajendra Rishi wrote, ""In Pahlavi language the word massa means great. In Avesta massa is also used in the sense of greatness."" Location. Herodotus described the Massagetae as living on a sizeable portion of the great plain east of the Caspian Sea. He several times refers to them as living ""beyond the River Araxes"", which he describes as running into the Caspian. Scholars have offered various identifications for this river. Herodotus had only a limited understanding of the geography of Europe and Asia, and may have confused several rivers in his statements about the Araxes. Customs. According to Herodotus: History. A number of different versions have been transmitted concerning the death of Cyrus the Great of Persia. One version reported by Herodotus: Continuity. Ammianus Marcellinus considered the Alans to be the former Massagetae. At the close of the 4th century CE, Claudian (the court poet of Emperor Honorius and Stilicho) wrote of Alans and Massagetae in the same breath: ""the Massagetes who cruelly wound their horses that they may drink their blood, the Alans who break the ice and drink the waters of Maeotis' lake"" (""In Rufinem""). Procopius writes in History of the Wars Book III: The Vandalic War: ""the Massagetae whom they now call Huns"" (XI. 37.), ""there was a certain man among the Massagetae, well gifted with courage and strength of body, the leader of a few men; this man had the privilege handed down from his fathers and ancestors to be the first in all the Hunnic armies to attack the enemy"" (XVIII. 54.). Evagrius Scholasticus (Ecclesiastical History. Book 3. Ch. II.): ""and in Thrace, by the inroads of the Huns, formerly known by the name of Massagetae, who crossed the Ister without opposition"". Tadeusz Sulimirski notes that the Sacae also invaded parts of Northern India. Weer Rajendra Rishi, an Indian linguist has identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which further lends credence to the possibility of historical Sacae influence in Northern India.

wikipedia-1275197," Islam in Ghana  The introduction of Islam into ancient Ghana, was mainly the result of the commercial activities of North African Berber traders. Islam made its entry into the northern territories of modern Ghana around the fifteenth century. Most Muslims in Ghana are Sunni, following the Maliki version of Islamic law. According to Pew Forum on Religious & Publi life 51% are Sunni, 16% Ahmadi and 8% Shia while the majority of the rest do not associate themselves with a particular group, Sufism is not widespread in Ghana; the Tijaniyah and the Qadiriyah brotherhoods, however, are represented.  Despite tensions in the Middle East and North Africa since the mid-1970s, Muslims and Christians in Ghana have had excellent relations. Guided by the authority of the Muslim Representative Council, religious, social, and economic matters affecting Muslims have often been redressed through negotiations and the Muslim Council has also been responsible for arranging pilgrimages to Mecca for believers who can afford the journey. In northern Ghana some metropolitan areas and cities, especially in areas with a significant Muslim population, there are now Islamic or Arabic schools offering primary, junior secondary and senior secondary education and however, most Muslim parents still send their children to state schools or private Christian schools and the more liberal of these schools show respect for the Muslim students among their ranks, for example by allowing Muslim prayers in their boarding houses or by opening or closing PTA meetings with a Muslim prayer and these developments are quite recent; this may explain the economic and technological gap between Muslims and non-Muslims. The official Ghana census reports 17.6% as being Muslims. "
wikipedia-1275236," Jairzinho  Jair Ventura Filho, better known as Jairzinho (; born December 25, 1944), is a former association footballer. A quick, powerful forward or winger, he was a member of the legendary Brazilian national team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup, during which he scored in every game Brazil played. In doing so, he became one of only 3 players – the others being Alcides Ghiggia and Just Fontaine – in the history of the World Cup to have scored in every game of the tournament and was thereafter nicknamed as ""The Hurricane"". He was listed at number 27 in World Soccer Magazine's list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century, one place ahead of Zinedine Zidane. Due to the economic and political situation of the time, as well as the Sport Legislation, he played most of his club football in South America where he spent eleven years at Rio de Janeiro club Botafogo. He went on to play in Europe during the final years of his career, a common pattern for South American players until the 1980s, when the economic and political situation changed. Jairzinho replaced his footballing idol Garrincha in both the Botafogo and Brazil teams, and played in three consecutive World Cups: 1966, 1970 and 1974. Biography. Jairzinho was born in Rio de Janeiro, where he went through the youth setup at local club Botafogo. He made his professional debut with the club as a striker at the age of fifteen. His hero Garrincha, whom he would eventually replace for both club and country, also played at Botafogo, albeit in Jairzinho's preferred position on the right wing. This resulted in Jairzinho spending most of his early games playing on the left wing or as a centre forward. However, he would fill in as a right winger, by far his strongest position, when Garrincha was injured. He made his international debut as a 19 year old in 1964 against Portugal, again when Garrincha was injured. He played in the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, however, and with Garrincha back in the side, he played as a left winger. Jairzinho struggled to be effective in this position, and he couldn't prevent Brazil from exiting the competition at the first round. When, after the tournament, Garrincha announced his retirement from international football, Jairzinho finally took over his idol's role for Brazil on the right wing. Now in his favourite position, Jairzinho became a far more effective and consistent performer for country. At the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, Jairzinho was one of Brazil's star players, and made history by scoring in every game for the Seleção, for which he received the epithet ""Furacão da Copa"" (""World Cup Hurricane""). He scored his seventh goal of the tournament in Brazil's 4–1 world cup win over Italy in the final. However, his impressive goals tally at the finals were not enough to win the Golden Boot, which went to Germany's Gerd Müller, who scored ten goals. Jairzinho has claimed that FIFA awarded him a ""best body on the planet"" prize for his athleticism; however, FIFA has no record of this award. Following his display in Mexico, Jairzinho moved to Europe to play for French side Marseille. However, he struggled with Marseille and soon returned to Brazil to play for Cruzeiro, with whom he won the Copa Libertadores in 1976. The Cruzeiro team at the time included the likes of Nelinho and Dirceu Lopes. Jairzinho scored two goals in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which would prove to be his last World Cup for Brazil. The 3rd-Place Final was his last match for Brazil until he was given a one-off farewell cap against Czechoslovakia on March 3, 1982 in a game which Brazil drew 1–1. He scored 33 goals in 81 games during his international career. Jairzinho finished his career playing for Portuguesa in Venezuela, making it one of the greatest teams in Venezuelan history, helping Portuguesa win a record 16 games in a row and their fourth of five championships. Following his retirement Jairzinho became a coach and coached the Gabon national team. However, Jairzinho was sacked by Gabon's Football Federation after a crushing defeat against Angola in a World Cup 2006 Qualifier held in Luanda. Perhaps his greatest achievement as a coach was spotting Ronaldo as a 14 year old whilst he was coaching São Cristóvão. He kick-started the career of the future three-time FIFA World Player of the Year by recommending him to Cruzeiro, his former side, and the Brazil youth team. Jairzinho is currently the manager of Esprof Atletico futebol Clube, a team based in Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro state who play in the Campeonato Carioca. "

wikipedia-1256446," RC Strasbourg  Racing Club de Strasbourg (commonly known as RC Strasbourg, RCS, or simply Strasbourg) is a French association football club founded in 1906 and professional since 1933, based in the city of Strasbourg, in Alsace. They currently play in the Championnat National, the third tier of French football, after successive promotions from CFA 2 and CFA. Once a member of France's Ligue 1 and a former champion, the club was relegated down to the fourth tier of French football at the conclusion of the 2010–11 Championnat National season after going into financial liquidation. The team has played at the Stade de la Meinau since 1914. The club is one of six clubs to have won all three major French trophies: the Championship in 1979, the Coupe de France in 1951, 1966, 2001 and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 2005. Strasbourg is also among the six teams to have played more than 2000 games in France's top flight (56 seasons) and has taken part in 52 European games since 1961. Despite these accomplishments, the RCS has never really managed to establish itself as one of France's leading clubs, experiencing relegation at least once a decade since the early 1950s. Racing has changed its manager 52 times in 75 years of professional play, often under pressure from the fans. The destiny of the RCS has always been wedded to the history of Alsace. Like the region, Racing has changed nationality three times and has a troubled history. Founded in what was then a part of the German Empire, the club from the beginning insisted on its Alsatian and popular roots, in opposition to the first Strasbourg-based clubs which came from the German-born bourgeoisie. When Alsace was returned to France in 1919, the club changed its name from ""1. FC Neudorf"" to the current ""Racing club de Strasbourg"" in imitation of Pierre de Coubertin's Racing Club de France, a clear gesture of francophilia. Racing players lived through World War II as most Alsatians did: evacuated in 1939, annexed in 1940 and striving to avoid nazification and incorporation in the Wehrmacht between 1942 and 1944. When Alsace was definitively returned to France, Racing's identity switched towards Jacobinism with, for example, emotional wins in the cup in 1951 and 1966 amidst Franco-Alsatian controversies. More recently, the club has been eager to promote its European vocation along with its strong local ties. History. Foundation and early years (1906–1945). On 10 June 1933, at the ""Restaurant de la Bourse"", the club made the jump to the professional ranks and thus joined the national championship established just a year before. RCS started competition in Division 2 but immediately earned promotion to the top flight at the end of the 1933–34 season, going through a pair of two-leg playoff matches, first against FC Mulhouse (0–0 and 3–1), and then against AS Saint-Étienne (2–0 and 4–4). Racing earned very decent results in the mid-1930s with a second place finish in 1934–35 and a third place finish the next season. In 1937, the club reached for the first time the final of the Coupe de France, losing to rivals FC Sochaux (1–2). This successful RCS team of the 1930s included two French internationals, Fritz Keller and Oscar Heisserer, as well as German striker Oskar Rohr who still holds the scoring record at Strasbourg. With the outbreak of World War II, professional sport was suspended and Alsatians were evacuated in south-west France, especially in the Dordogne. During the Phoney War, a group of youngsters kept the club existing in Périgueux where they won the Dordogne championship in 1940. After the French defeat, Alsace was ""de facto"" annexed by the Third Reich and, in August 1940, the team took up play as ""Rasensportclub Straßburg"" in the Gauliga Elsaß, a top flight amateur division in German football. RCS captured their group in 1941 and participated in the regional finals, where they were put out by FC Mülhausen. The team earned second place results in each of the following two seasons and made an appearance in the opening round of the DFB Pokal (German Cup) in 1942. Starting in 1942, Alsatians were forcibly conscripted in the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS and several club players—including Alsatian star Oscar Heisserer—fled or had their teammates deliberately wound them to avoid incorporation. Oskar Rohr also had been imprisoned since 1940 after serving in the Légion Etrangère at the outbreak of the war. During a game against SS side ""SG SS Straßburg"", Rasensportclub players wore a uniform consisting of a blue jersey, white shorts and red socks as a clear display of French patriotism. First national successes... and failures (1945–1976). Allied armies retook Alsace in 1944 and the club quickly resumed play as ""Racing Club de Strasbourg"" in France's top flight. The team was then built around Oscar Heisserer—who became in April 1945 the first Alsatian to captain the national team—and Spanish defender Paco Mateo. In 1947, the ""Strasbourgeois"" reached for the second time the final of the cup at Colombes, this time losing to Lille OSC, 0–2. They remained in first division competition until, at the end of the 1948–49 season, it appeared the side would be relegated. However, neighbouring club SR Colmar liquidated their professional team, leaving room for Strasbourg to stay up. In 1951, The ""Bleus"" won their first major trophy, defeating Valenciennes 3–0 to finally bring the Coupe de France home. The significance of this victory went far beyond the sporting realm as Alsace was then shaken by the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre investigation. Fourteen Alsatians, most of them forcibly incorporated in the Das Reich division, had been charged with war crimes, a move that aroused considerable resentment in the region. Immediately after their return in Strasbourg, the players held a symbolical and emotional ceremony at the city's monument to the deaths. Only one year later, Strasbourg was relegated following the worst ever season in the club's history. They were however back in the top flight after only one season in Division 2. In 1954–55, thanks to the arrival of Austrian star Ernst Stojaspal, Strasbourg had one of its best championship seasons in the post-war era, eventually ending with the 4th place. The club, however, was unable to build on this success and was relegated to Division 2 in 1957 and 1960, each time gaining immediate promotion back to the top flight. During the 1960s, the club was able to participate in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup thanks to the city's ""Foire européenne"". In 1964–65 under Paul Frantz's guidance, Racing ousted giants AC Milan and FC Barcelona before falling in the quarter-finals against Manchester United. A year later, they repeated as cup winners beating champions FC Nantes in final by the score of 1–0. On this occasion, captain René Hauss accomplished the remarkable feat of winning two cups with the same club with a 15 years-interval. Other key team members during this era included Raymond Kaelbel and young talents Gilbert Gress and Gérard Hausser. Again, Racing's triumph in the cup was not without controversy, reporter Thierry Roland said on live TV that ""the cup leaving France"", a comment that was deemed offensive by many in Alsace. In 1968, Racing started a process that would eventually lead to a merger with two other clubs, the ""Association Sportive Culturelle de la Meinau"" and, most importantly, the CS des Pierrots 1922 Strasbourg. The merger was effective in 1970 and the new entity was named ""Le Racing Pierrots Strasbourg Meinau"", or RPSM. The ""Pierrots"" were then a very successful amateur team – they won the national amateur championship in 1969 and 1970—but lacked sufficient structures to jump to professional play while Racing was more wealthy but in search for talent. The merger thus appeared as an excellent opportunity to build a powerful football club in Strasbourg and was favoured by business and political circles. However, the wedding was a difficult one with many internal struggles that were evidenced when some of the former ""Pierrots"" left the new entity as soon as 1971 to re-found their former club. That same year, the RPSM was relegated despite the arrival at the end of the season of Yugoslavian star Ivica Osim. As usual, Strasbourg then won immediate promotion with Osim and two French internationals in its ranks: Jean-Noël Huck and Marc Molitor. Back in division 1 in 1972, the club made one of the biggest transfer blunders in its history: Osim was sent to CS Sedan to leave a foreign player spot for Reinhard Libuda. The Yugoslavian left Strasbourg in tears but helped Sedan to decent results while Libuda was quickly suspended due to a match fixing scandal in Germany and eventually released in March 1973. In 1976, the club was again relegated and went back to its old identity as Racing Club de Strasbourg, reflecting the final failure of the RPSM merger. Glorious years (1976–1980). In 1976, the future seemed somewhat dark for Racing: the club had been relegated for the second time in only four years, was torn apart by internal struggles following the failure of the merger and was desperately seeking municipal subventions to reach a balanced budget. Financial difficulties meant that Racing was unable to retain or replace its best players (Huck, Molitor, Gress, Hausser, Spiegel) who left for other clubs or retired. This impossibility to buy on the transfer market meant that, for the first time, Strasbourg had to rely essentially on players out of its youth academy and local amateur clubs. Fortunately for the club, the mid-1970s saw the emergence of a very talented generation of youngsters consisting mainly of Léonard Specht, Jean-Jacques Marx, René Deutschmann, Yves Ehrlacher, Albert Gemmrich, Roland Wagner and Joël Tanter. Along with goalkeeper Dominique Dropsy and captain Jacky Duguépéroux, these players formed the backbone of the team for the superb 1976–1980 period. During these four years, Racing won two championships (D2 in 1977 and D1 in 1979), reached very honourable league rankings the two other years (third in 1978, fifth in 1980) and had its best results ever in European play (UEFA cup round of sixteen in 1979, Champions cup quarter finals in 1980). The start of the 1976–77 season was nevertheless difficult. In November, after a defeat at Amiens, Racing called Alexander Schwartz out of retirement to help and supervise the work of player-manager Heinz Schilcher. Schwartz was an important player of the 1930s team and had a renowned international coaching career behind him, especially with spells at the Netherlands national team and Benfica. Under his guidance, the team quickly improved, finishing ahead of it group to earn promotion to Division 1 and defeating AS Monaco for the Division 2 championship title, the first one in the club's history. After accomplishing his mission, Schwartz definitely retired and was replaced by Gilbert Gress. As a player, Gress had achieved iconic status with Racing supporters. A child of the Neudorf, he was a genial player with a strong personality, the first Frenchman to shine in the neighbouring Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart. His second return to Strasbourg, after a first comeback as a player, was greeted with enthusiasm and his charisma aroused a strong public interest for the team's performances, with attendance rates at an all-time high. The 1977–78 season saw the peculiar dominance of the two promoted sides with Monaco going on to win the championship and Strasbourg reaching an unexpected third place, the best ranking since 1936. Gress printed his mark on the team right away, insisting on the recruitment of experienced, hard-working players (Jacky Novi, Raymond Domenech, Francis Piasecki) instead of foreign stars and putting into practice innovative tactical ideas. A self-proclaimed admirer of Ajax Amsterdam's total football, Gress wanted all his players to both defend and attack and asked for great versatility. This was rather unusual in French football at that time. In most French clubs, defenders were told not to cross the midfield line and strikers had almost no defensive duties. To the contrary, Gress instructed his forwards to exert immediate pressure on the other's side defenders and encouraged offensive initiatives by his own backs. A sign of versatility was the fact the side's top-scorer during that era, Albert Gemmrich, played on the left wing despite being right-footed. Gemmrich developed an ability to score with both feet after an injury that forced him to train using only his left foot and Gress used his peculiar profile to puzzle defenses, with great success. For the 1978–79 season, Racing kept essentially the same team that had won promotion in 1977 and a third place in 1978. The only exceptions were the addition of midfielder Roger Jouve and the exchange between striker Jacques Vergnes and Chadian player Nabatingue Toko. A French international, Vergnes clashed with Gress due to his unwillingness to assume defensive duties and his vocal frustration after being regularly sidelined. He was quickly sent to Bordeaux six games after the start the season. His replacement, Tonko, was the only foreign player on the squad that year, a fact that again was unusual since French club football was at that time still very dependent on the qualities of players from abroad. Strasbourg took the lead early in the season and did not give it back until the end in spite of widespread skepticism from national followers. The absence of big names in the team was considered by many to be a crippling handicap against established teams like AS Saint-Etienne or FC Nantes which had internationally renowned players. For his part, Gress used the critical review of the press to boost his player's motivation and insisted that ""the star is the team"". Racing finished atop the championship on 56 points with an undefeated home record. The return from Lyon, where the title game was played, was triumphant with huge crowds greeting the team at every railway station in Alsace before the arrival of the train at Strasbourg. The club saw same movement during the 1979 inter-season. Chairman Alain Léopold was replaced by the influential André Bord, Duguépéroux ended his pro career and Gemmrich left for Bordeaux. To replace him, Bord imposed the recruitment of Carlos Bianchi to Gress. Bianchi was a prolific goalscorer but he was also a very traditional striker with no intention to commit to defense and teamplay, to Gress' despair. The season was marked by the return of internal struggles, especially with the increasingly confrontational relationship between Gress and Bord, but the team nevertheless achieved a fifth place finish and advanced to the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup, where it was eliminated by Ajax Amsterdam (0–0;0–4). Chronic instability (since 1980). The ""Bleus""' success was short-lived. In September 1980, Gress was controversially sacked and, after several seasons of middling results, Racing was returned to second tier play in 1986. For the first time, Strasbourg failed to win immediate promotion back to the first tier, eventually ending with the 9th place in its group, the worst ranking ever for the club. Success however came back with the 1987–88 season as new manager Henryk Kasperczak led Racing to its second Division 2 title with players like Juan Simon, Peter Reichert and the returning Léonard Specht. Strasbourg, however, was unable to preserve its spot in the top-flight and was back in Division 2 in 1989. With Specht now a manager, Racing failed to secure promotion for the next two seasons, each time falling in the playoffs, first against OGC Nice and then again RC Lens. In 1991–92, Gress came back to his hometown as manager and, after defeating Rennes (0–0; 4–1) in the final promotion playoff match, Strasbourg made a lasting return to the top flight. The 1992–93 season saw the club finish at eighth place, a ranking that has not been equaled since, allowing the likes of José Cobos, Frank Leboeuf and Marc Keller to shine in the top flight. At the end of the 1993–94 season, Gress definitely left Racing due to personal disagreements with the club's direction. He was replaced by Daniel Jeandupeux who was himself fired after eight months. Jacky Duguépéroux then took over the club and led it to its most brilliant period since the 1979 title. During the 1990s, there was a mounting interest for football in France with the rise of the national team and, like other clubs, Racing benefited from this context. The club was then able to attract French major players like Franck Sauzée and foreign stars like Aleksandr Mostovoi. With this mix of established players and rising prospects, the team reached the final of the cup in 1995, losing to Paris Saint-Germain (0–1). In April that same year, Strasbourg was also the only team to defeat champions FC Nantes, 2–0 at la Meinau. After successfully going through the 1995 Intertoto Cup during the summer, Racing was able to participate in the UEFA Cup where they reached the second round, losing to Italian giants AC Milan. In 1996, the Bosman ruling entered into force and made it difficult for French clubs to retain their best players. Strasbourg was no exception. During the summer, the team lost Mostovoi and its two French internationals—Marc Keller and Frank Leboeuf. Despite these departures, Racing fared well in the league, staying most of the season in the top 5 before ultimately settling for a 9th place finish. That same year, the IMG–McCormack Group was chosen by the municipality to take control of the club. The players, still trained by Jacky Duguépéroux, went on to capture the Coupe de la Ligue—the first national trophy in eighteen years—by defeating Bordeaux in a penalty shootout. A good UEFA Cup run followed that victory, allowing young players formed at the club like Olivier Dacourt or Valérien Ismaël to shine in continental play. After a successful qualification round against Glasgow Rangers and Liverpool F.C., Racing defeated Inter Milan 2–0 at la Meinau, but fell 0–3 in the away leg. In the meantime, IMG had taken over the club in the summer of 1997 and Patrick Proisy, former tennis player and head of the French branch, became president. He was joined a year later by his friend Claude Le Roy as manager. The Proisy–Leroy period at Racing was a troubled one with poor results, several scandals and a general disillusionment of the fans towards the club's management. Several suspicious transfers during that period have led Strasbourg's prosecutor to indict Proisy and Le Roy of misuse of company assets and forgery in 2006. During their reign, the club sold all of its best prospects and essentially replaced them with disappointing, expensive foreign players (Diego Hector Garay, Gonzalo Belloso, Mario Haas among others). In 2000–01, the club accomplished the paradoxical feat of being relegated after spending the whole season in the bottom three while winning the French cup with a victory on penalties against Amiens SC. On that occasion, Paraguayan star José Luis Chilavert scored the winning penalty for Strasbourg at the Stade de France. In 2001–02, The club, led by manager Ivan Hasek, immediately re-took its place among the football elite in the Hexagon by finishing runners-up in Division 2. The year 2003 saw the departure of IMG and Proisy, to the fans' pleasure. The club was taken over by a pool of local investors with former player Marc Keller staying as director general. The new ownership focused on cleaning up the club's finances as well as re-gaining the hearts and minds of the Alsatian public. In 2005, Racing won their second domestic trophy in four years when they beat SM Caen 2–1 in the final of the League Cup, a feat which provided them with a passport to the 2005–06 UEFA Cup where they reached the last sixteen. In 2006, Strasbourg was again relegated after a poor season. The club was taken over by real estate investor Philippe Ginestet and celebrated its centennial in the fall of 2006 with various events including an exhibition and a friendly match against Marseille. Ginestet hired French legend Jean-Pierre Papin as the new manager and the club again won immediate promotion to the top flight in 2007, finishing at third place. In spite of this, Papin resigned as manager, citing internal relationship problems, and was succeeded by Jean-Marc Furlan. Under Furlan, the RCS was unable to preserve its spot in Ligue 1, mainly due to eleven consecutive defeats at the end of the 2007–08 season, a record for post-World War II football in France. Furlan was nevertheless confirmed as manager for the following Ligue 2 season but failed in his mission to bring the club back in the top-tier as Racing ended 4th with a blasting defeat at Montpellier. Furlan's contract was subsequently terminated and Phillipe Ginestet stepped down from his position as chairman while remaining the major shareholder. He was succeeded by Léonard Specht who picked the legendary Gilbert Gress as manager. However, Gress quickly entered in conflict with many members of the club, including Ginestet whom he violently attacked just after his side's defeat to Châteauroux in the inaugural league game. Ginestet then convened an extraordinary meeting of the board to sack Gilbert Gress, prompting Léonard Specht's resignation. Gress was replaced by assistant manager Pascal Janin, first as a caretaker and then as permanent manager when Ginestet re-took the club's presidency at the end of August 2009. In the 2009–2010 Season, a final day of the season away defeat relegated Strasbourg to the National as they suffered their second relegation in three seasons. The 2010–2011 season saw them narrowly miss out on promotion back to Ligue 2 as they finished 4th behind Guingamp. On 17 July 2011, Racing Club de Strasbourg entered total liquidation and were removed from the National in favour of AS Cherbourg. On 25 August 2011, after lengthy negotiations with the FFF, Strasbourg were eventually reinstated into the fifth tier of the French footballing, the CFA 2, Group C. Strasbourg won promotion to the CFA, the fourth tier of French Football, at the first attempt in the 2011/12 season finishing on 100 points. Strasbourg finished as champions of the CFA at the end of the 2012–13 season and are back in the National. Colours and crest. While the colours of the town are red and white, Racing has always played in a combination of blue and white. The exact origin of this choice of colours is unknown. Over the years, the most common uniform has been composed of a medium blue jersey, white shorts and medium blue socks. However, during the last ten years the team has regularly switched between medium blue, dark blue, sky blue, and white as the main color of its home jersey. Since 2007, the Flag of Alsace is featured on the back of the club's shirt. Hummel is the current kit designer. Previously (1973–2000; 2004–2007), Racing was equipped by Adidas, which has its French seat in Landersheim, between Strasbourg and Saverne. Asics also supplied the club (2000–03). The current team crest has been in use—with interruptions—since 1976 and is generally considered as the most legitimate one. It includes a stylized stork (symbol of Alsace), a red diagonal stripe from the city's coat of arms and a depiction of the Cathedral along with the club's initials: RCS. Between 1997 and 2006, the club used another logo, introduced by Patrick Proisy. This crest was then considered to be more ""modern"" and was supposed to depict at the same time the Cathedral and a stork. The resemblance, however, was far from being obvious to everyone and the design was quickly derogatively nicknamed ""Pac Man"" due to some common traits with the famous video game. In 2006, the new management of the club, acceding to a supporter demand, re-installed the 1976 crest. Stadium. Racing have been playing at the Stade de la Meinau in southern Strasbourg ever since 1914. The stadium hosted the 1938 World Cup and Euro 1984. Its maximum capacity was downsized from 45,000 to 29,000 during the 1990s to respect new safety standards. La Meinau has been chosen among the 12 stadia composing France's bid for the organization of Euro 2016. Should France be awarded the tournament, its capacity would be upgraded to 36, 000. Supporters. Historically, Racing has its roots in southern Strasbourg in the working-class Neudorf, Meinau and Polygone neighborhoods. In the 1930s, the team was the only one in the area to jump to professional play and, with the help of good results during that decade, it built support all around the town. In Strasbourg like in the rest of France, there is only one pro football club in every city and hence no in-town rivalry, a fact that heavily contrasts with the situation in Great Britain, Italy or Spain. Nowadays, as the only professional football club in Alsace, Racing attracts a large fan base that covers both the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin départements as well as the eastern part of the Moselle. The fan-base ouside of this area is essentially limited to people that, for a reason or another, have a personal link with Alsace. The club also has ties to the other side of the Rhine, especially through a supporter friendship with Karlsruher SC and regular friendly matches during the summer. On average, the attendance in Ligue 1 has been around 20,000 for a stadium capacity of 29,000. Supporters groups include the ""Ultra Boys 90"", the ""Kop Ciel et Blanc"" and the ""Club central des supporters"". Groups websites : ""Ultra Boys 90"" ""Kop Ciel et Blanc""""Club central des supporters"" Most of the supporter groups and the most vocal fans in general have elected location in the Kop at the ""Quart de Virage Nord-Ouest"" (North-West quarter corner). Strasbourg supporters have the reputation to be faithful yet critical. Former captain Corentin Martins has once asserted that the Strasbourg public is ""demanding, but fair"". The club is often dubbed ""L'OM de l'Est"" (""the Olympique Marseille from the East"") in the French media due to passion, regular crises and instability. Racing is always an emotional topic in Alsace. It is often said that some may love it or hate it, or even both at the same time, but that it leaves no one indifferent. Racing Strasbourg's main rivals are FC Metz. The clubs compete is what is generally referred as the ""Derby de l'Est"" (""the Eastern derby"") in France, a rather inappropriate term since the two cities are 150 km. distant. There is however a significant degree of inter-regional rivalry between Alsace and Lorraine, leading to some acrimony between the fans on both sides. The two clubs met each other in the quarter-finals of the 1995 Intertoto Cup in what was the first ever match between two French teams in a European competition. Strasbourg won the game 2–0. When FC Mulhouse was professional, the two sides also nourished a rivalry that persists as far as youth teams are concerned. Ownership and chairmanship. Overview. Racing's history has always been closely intertwined with local business and politics. In the 1930s, the club's jump to professionalism was sustained by car manufacturer Emile Mathis who had his factory just in front of the stade de la Meinau. RCS quickly entered a rivalry with FC Sochaux, a team that was backed by Mathis' competitor Peugeot. After WW2, Mathis ceased activity and the club had to find other sponsors including the Crédit Mutuel—a large banking institution that has its roots in Alsace and appeared on the club's shirt throughout most of the 1960s and 1970s—as well as the town's municipality. In 1980, André Bord, a prominent local Gaullist politician and former minister during the Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou presidencies, became chairman. Bord could boast his connections in business, political and artistic elites and vowed to make Racing a big name in French football. However, he quickly entered a confrontation with charismatic manager Gilbert Gress that culminated in September 1980 when the announcement of Gress' departure provoked crowd anger and riots scenes during a game against FC Nantes. The inability for the influential president and the talented manager to get along with each other and the 1980 trauma may explain why Racing was unable to perform lastingly at the top level after the 1979 title. In 1986, Bord left the professional section and introduced fashion designer Daniel Hechter as his successor. Hechter had previously been banned from pro football following his involvement in the Paris Saint Germain secret funds scandal but was nevertheless able to re-take a president job at Strasbourg thanks to a sentence reduction. It was the first attempt to bring an outsider to the local context at the club's head, but the experiment ended in failure in 1990 as the club neared bankruptcy. Racing was at that time salvaged by the Strasbourg municipality which took a 49% share of the club but had to relinquish it a few years later as the Pasqua legislation restricted public support to professional sport. In 1997, two projects were competing to buy the municipal share and effectively take control of the club. The first was led by then-president Roland Weller, a local businessman. The second bid was made by American IMG- McCormack Group through its French branch headed by Patrick Proisy. At that time, IMG was trying to develop its activities in European football and had failed the previous year in its effort to buy Olympique de Marseille. The American group presented an ambitious project with an entirely new youth academy as well as plans for a renovated stadium, eventually winning the competition for Racing's ownership for a price of 1.5 million euros. The club became a ""Société Anonyme à Objet Sportif"" and then a ""Société Anonyme Sportive Professionnelle"", a status very similar to the general corporate status, albeit with restrictions like the impossibility to enter the stock market and the obligation to keep ties with the original association. Proisy became the chairman of the board with full control over the professional section but not the omni-sport structure that still possessed the club's name and its affiliation to the Fédération Française de Football. This was evidenced in 2002 when Proisy and Bord, still a chairman of the omni-sport, entered a dispute that led to the inability for the pro players to wear the name ""Racing club de Strasbourg"" on their jerseys for some time. Proisy's reign at Strasbourg was fraught with misunderstandings, frustration and poor results on the pitch. The Alsatian public especially resented the fact that Proisy was unwilling to settle in Strasbourg, instead controlling the club's destiny from IMG's offices in Paris. Racing's troubles as well as the town's refusal to finance an extension of the stade de la Meinau to host World Cup 1998 provoked heated debate during the 2001 municipal election and eventually became part of the elements that drove to the defeat of Catherine Trautmann. In 2003, the club was bought back by a pool of local investors including Egon Gindorf who became chairman, Patrick Adler, Pierre Schmidt and Philippe Ginestet who all had been club sponsors during the IMG era. The new ownership bought the club for a symbolical euro to an IMG group eager to cut its losses after the death of Mark McCormack but had to cover a 3 million euro deficit to close the 2002–03 budget. It is estimated that Racing lost 15 million euros during the IMG era, mainly due to a dubious recruitment policy. Thanks to a prudent transfer policy initiated by director Marc Keller and good attendance rates, the new management was able to redress finances but the club's economical situation has remained fragile up to now. In 2004, Gindorf experienced personal and financial difficulties and was willing to scale down his involvement at Racing. It was understood that Philippe Ginestet would become the new chairman at the end of the 2004–05 season. However, this move was opposed by Keller who, in June 2005, clearly announced that he would not work with Ginestet. Keller had in fact been acting as the club's head since 2002 but was only a minor shareholder. He nevertheless was able to mobilize his iconic status with supporters to, at first, block Ginestet's accession to chairmanship, provoking a deadlock that lasted throughout 2005 as the club was looking for an investor. In the fall of 2005, it was announced that Alain Afflelou, the biggest optician in France and a former president of the Girondins de Bordeaux, would be the new owner, but he was eventually out-bided by Ginestet who took control of the club midway through the 2005–06 season, forcing Keller's departure a few months later. Ginestet held a majority share during four years, which he sold in the end of 2009 for a price of 1.6 millions Euros. Presidential history. Below is a list of RC Strasbourg's 15 presidents since the start of the professional era in 1933. The president has not always been the real owner of the club. For example, between 1990 and 1997 the municipality was the major shareholder, but it chose to delegate the chairmanships to independent local entrepreneurs. The 2009–2010 season saw a record of five successive presidents. Early into the season, Léonard Specht stepped down from his position, after the sacking of Glibert Gress, whom he had appointed as manager. but, after some turmoil, Fournier quickly entered a dispute with the new major shareholder, Alain Fontenla. Fournier's contract was terminated in February and he was replaced by Luc Dayan on an interim basis. Players. Current squad. ""As of 10. August 2012"" Reserves squad. Strasbourg's B team plays in the Division d'Honneur, Group A. Pro players also often play for the reserves. Former players. RCS does not have an official hall of fame or an all-time XI. Various selections have been made by press and supporters but none has achieved universal respect. 21 players have been capped for France while playing for Strasbourg. The most notable one is Oscar Heisserer who played a record 18 times with the national team while at Strasbourg and was the first Alsatian and first and only RCS player to wear the armband for France. Dominique Dropsy, Léonard Specht and Gérard Hausser also earned more than 10 caps while Marc Molitor is one of the rare examples of a player being capped for the national team while playing in the Division 2. Unsurprinsgly, it is during the 1978–1979 title season that Racing had the most players included in the national squad. On 7 October 1978 were a record four RCS players (Dominique Dropsy, Roger Jouve, Francis Piasecki, Albert Gemmrich) on the field for a Euro 1980 qualifying game against Luxembourg. This figure was repeated a month later for a friendly against Spain (Dropsy, Piasecki, Gemmrich and Léonard Specht). Frank Leboeuf and Marc Keller were the last RCS players to earn a cap during the 1995–1996 season. Leboeuf is one of the two former RCS in the French team that won World Cup 1998, the other one being Youri Djorkaeff. The last player once at Strasbourg to play for France is Olivier Dacourt while Richard Dutruel is the last international to play for RCS (both in 2004). With regional feelings still strong in Alsace, the performances of local players logically attract special attention. Seven out of the ten players with the most apparitions for Racing are from Alsace: René Hauss (who holds the record), Léonard Specht, René Deutschmann, Edmond Haan, Gérard Hausser, Jean Schuth and Raymond Kaelbel. Since 1979, there is also a peculiar tradition that every Racing team to win a trophy or reach a final featured a Breton as captain, manager or both. Jacky Duguépéroux captained the 1979 team and won the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 2005 as a manager. The 2001 Coupe de France winning team for itself included Yvon Pouliquen as manager and Corentin Martins as captain. Pouliquen also was the captain for the 1995 final. Apart from French internationals and Alsatians, there is a strong tradition to have foreign players from Central and Eastern Europe at Strasbourg. The successful Racing team of the 1930s regularly included Austrians both as players and coaches, a tradition that was continued when Ernst Stojaspal played at la Meinau in the 1950s. Other ""Mitteleuropa"" players fondly remembered include Alexander Schwartz, Ivica Osim, Ivan Hasek, Alexander Vencel or Danijel Ljuboja while Russian Aleksandr Mostovoi is the last world-class star to play for Racing to this date. Managers. Strasbourg has had 48 managers in the professional era, with the holder of the office changing 56 times. This is a record in French football only surpassed by Olympique de Marseille. Gilbert Gress holds the record for the longest-serving manager at the club, both for a single spell (39 months btw. 1977–80, 152 matches) and overall (75 months in three spells, 275 matches). Paul Frantz holds the record for the most spells at Racing with four (73 months overall, 227 matches). Jacky Duguépéroux is the only manager to win two trophies with Strasbourg. The current manager is Pascal Janin, who has occupied virtually every coaching position at the club (youth coach, reserves coach, goalkeeping coach, assistant-manager) before being appointed as Gress' successor. "
wikipedia-1256452," Toulouse FC  Toulouse Football Club, also known simply as Toulouse (familiarly as TFC), is a French association football club based in the city of Toulouse. The club was founded in 1937 and currently play in Ligue 1, the top level of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium Municipal located within the city. The first team is managed by former club player Alain Casanova and captained by defender Jonathan Zebina. ""Les Pitchouns"" have won 3 Ligue 2 and 1 Coupe de France. Toulouse have participated in European competition five times. In 2008, the club, among celebratory fanfare, qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history and, in the following season, played in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Europa League. Toulouse is presided over by French businessman Olivier Sadran. Sadran took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001, which resulted in the club being moved to the Championnat National. Toulouse has served as a springboard club for several players in its existence most notably, Fabien Barthez and André-Pierre Gignac. Barthez established himself at the club before moving to clubs such as Monaco and Manchester United where he won several club honours. He played on the France national team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup serving as a starting goalkeeper. History. Toulouse Football Club was founded on 20 March 1937 and began in Ligue 2. The club finished second in the South Group of 1945–46 Ligue 2 season and were promoted to Ligue 1 almost a decade after its foundation. Toulouse finished in 14th position in its first campaign in the top tier of French football and maintained the category. Following four mid-table finishes, TFC claimed fourth spot in 1949–50 Ligue 1 season, the club's then highest position. However, after reaching its pinnacle, the club suffered a major down low the following term, finishing 17th and being relegated to Ligue 2 in 1951. Notwithstanding, hell didn't last and ""Le Téfécé"" won their first title by claiming the Ligue 2 in 1953, therefore being promoted to the top-flight. This success was followed by the club's Coupe de France triumph in 1957. It was TFC's first and last major honor. Toulouse coped with this lack of titile success by assuring themselves as a Ligue 1 mainstay, regularly finishing in the top half of the table since its return (including a 2nd spot in 1955, the club's best finish ever).  The Pink City was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes. Adopting red and yellow jerseys, the club started out in Ligue 2 and in 1977 reclaimed the name Toulouse FC. Now wearing purple and white, ""Les Pitchouns"" gained top-flight promotion in 1982. A side containing Jacques Santini and Swiss forward Daniel Jeandupeux earned a famous penalty shoot-out victory against Diego Maradona's Napoli in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup, Toulouse's maiden European campaign, but it failed to herald a bright new era. Instead, with goalkeeper Fabien Barthez having made his breakthrough and moved on, Toulouse were relegated in 1994. They subsequently bounced back and forth between Ligues 1 and 2 before slipping to the third flight in 2001 after financial problems. Toulouse were back in the top flight two seasons later, steadily finding their feet before a memorable 2007 campaign when they finished third to earn a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. The draw was unfavourable, however, and Liverpool overpowered them 5-0 on aggregate. For the second match of the 2007–2008 season, Toulouse beat the Olympique Lyonnais 1–0 at the Stadium Municipal with a goal from Johan Elmander. After the victory against Olympique Lyonnais Toulouse struggled all season to avoid relegation. Their Ligue 1 was finally secured on the last day of the season with a 2–1 home win against Valenciennes. The 2008–2009 season marked unexpected success for Toulouse. The club finished fourth in the Ligue 1 table with 64 points, and secured a spot in the new Europa League. After a difficult season the previous year in which the club struggled to avoid relegation, not much was expected of Toulouse. The 2008–2009 season also marked the emergence of striker André-Pierre Gignac, who led all scorers in Ligue 1 with 24 goals and was awarded a call-up to the French national team. Stadium. TFC play their home matches at the Stadium Municipal. Built in 1937, the stadium presently has a capacity of 35,472. The stadium was used in the 1998 World Cup. Colours. The violet is a reference to one of two Toulouse nicknames: ""la Cité des violettes"" (the City of Violets), the second one being ""la Ville rose"" (the Pink City), which explains the colour of former alternate jerseys. The team's logo displays the gold and blood-red Occitan cross, the symbol of Occitania, of which Toulouse is a historical capital. Club rivalries. Derby de la Garonne. The Derby de la Garonne is a football match contested between French clubs Girondins de Bordeaux and Toulouse FC. The name of the derby derives from the fact that Bordeaux and Toulouse are the two major clubs that play in cities that situate themselves along the Garonne River. The consistency and competitiveness of the rivalry developed following Toulouse's return to Ligue 1 after being administratively relegated to the Championnat National in 2001. Players. Current squad. French teams are limited to four players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

wikipedia-1256454," Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi  Major General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi (3 March 1924, Umuahia - 29 July 1966, Lalupon, Oyo State) was a Nigerian soldier. He served as the Head of State of Nigeria from 16 January 1966 until he was overthrown and killed on 29 July 1966 by a group of northern army officers who revolted against the government. Early life. Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi was born to Mazi Ezeugo Aguiyi's on 3 March 1924, in Umuahia-Ibeku, present-day Abia State, Nigeria. When he was eight years old, Ironsi moved in with his older sister Anyamma, who was married to Theophilius Johnson, a Sierra Leonean diplomat in Umuahia. Ironsi subsequently took the last name of his brother-in-law, who became his father figure. At the age of 18, Ironsi joined the Nigerian Army against the wishes of his sister. Military career. Aguiyi-Ironsi enlisted into the Nigerian Army on 2 February 1942 and was admitted and excelled in military training at Eaton Hall, England and also attended Royal Army Ordnance Corps before he was later commissioned officer as an infantry officer in the rank of Lieutenant on 12 June 1949. He soon returned to Nigeria to serve as the ""aide-de-camp"" to John Macpherson, Governor General of Nigeria and he was assigned as equerry to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Nigeria in 1956, for which assignment he was sent to Buckingham Palace to train. During the Congo Crisis of the 1960s, the United Nations Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld, appealed to the Nigerian government to send troops to Congo. Lieutenant Colonel Ironsi led the 5th battalion to the Kivu and Leopoldville provinces of Congo. His unit proved integral to the peacekeeping effort, and he was soon appointed the Force Commander of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. Congo. In 1960 he led the Nigerian contingent in Congo. There he single-handedly negotiated the release of Austrian medical personnel and Nigerian troops when they were ambushed by Katangese rebels. For this he was awarded the 1st class Ritta Kreuz Award. He also single-handedly confronted an angry mob in Leopoldville, disbanding them. This and many other exploits earned him the name ""Johnny Ironside"", a corruption of his name ""Ironsi"" with reference to various British military historical parallels. Ironsi returned from Congo in 1964 during the post-independence ""Nigerianization"" of the country's institutions of government. It was decided that the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Nigerian Army, Major General Welby-Everard, would step down to allow the government to appoint an indigenous GOC. Ironsi led the pack of candidates jostling for the coveted position. A consensus was reached by the ruling Northern People's Congress (NPC) and National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) coalition government, and Ironsi became General Officer Commanding of the Nigerian Army on 9 February 1965. Politics. Fall of the First Republic. The political crisis in post-colonial Nigeria precipitated into a breakdown of law and order in some of the country's provinces. The inability of Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa to quell the situation incited the military to terminate civilian rule in a bloody coup d'etat on 14 January 1966. The revolutionary soldiers, led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, an Igbo from Okpanam near Asaba, present day Delta state, eradicated the uppermost echelon of politicians from the Northern and Western provinces. Though Ironsi, an Igbo, was originally slated for assassination, he was able to outmanoeuvre the rebellious soldiers in Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory. Ironsi then rose from the ashes of the First Republic to become the country's first military Head of State by compelling Acting President Nwafor Orizu to officially surrender power to him. 194 days in office. Ironsi inherited a Nigeria deeply fractured by its ethnic and religious cleavages. The fact that none of the high-profile victims of the 1966 coup were of Igbo extraction, and also that the main beneficiaries of the coup were Igbo, led the Northern part of the country to believe that it was an Igbo conspiracy. Though Ironsi moved swiftly to dispel this notion by courting the aggrieved ethnic groups through political appointments and patronage, his failure to punish the coup plotters and the promulgation of the now infamous ""Decree No. 34""—which abrogated the country's federal structure in exchange for a unitary one— crystallized this conspiracy theory. During his short regime Aguiyi-Ironsi promulgated lots of decrees among them the Emergency Decree known as the Constitution Suspension and Amendment Decree No.1 suspending the Constitution even though he left intact those sections of the constitution that dealt with fundamental human rights, freedom of expression and conscience. Also the Circulation of Newspaper Decree No.2 which removed the restriction to press freedom put in place by the preceding civilian administration. According to Ndayo Uko, the Decree no.2 was to serve ""as a kind gesture to the press.."" to safeguard himself when he went on later to promulgate the Defamatory and Offensive Decree No.44 of 1966 which made it an ""offense to display or pass on pictorial representation, sing songs, or play instruments the words of which are likely to provoke any section of the country."" Also the controversial Unification Decree No. 34 which aimed to unify Nigeria into a unitary state. Even though this decree was abolished when Aguiyi-Ironsi was deposed and killed, the decree was to affect the Nigerian foreign policy decision making system in a significant way: the abolition of ""independence"" of the regions in foreign policy. Until then the Nigerian regional governments could make their own foreign relation policies independent of the federal government. This decree removed Nigeria's many contradictory tunes on foreign policy and various ""mini-embassies"" abroad were closed down. Counter coup and assassination. On July 29, 1966, Ironsi spent the night at the Government House Ibadan as part of a nation-wide tour. His host, Lieutenant Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, Military Governor of Western Nigeria, alerted him to a possible mutiny within the army. Ironsi desperately tried to contact his Army Chief of Staff, Yakubu Gowon, but he was unreachable. In the early hours of the morning, the Government House, Ibadan, was surrounded by soldiers led by Theophilus Danjuma. Danjuma arrested Ironsi and questioned him about his alleged complicity in the coup, which saw the demise of the Sardauna of Sokoto, Ahmadu Bello. Although some have argued that Fajuyi was not a target in this counter-coup, Theophilus Danjuma, William Walbe and others have gone on record to say that they probably wanted him ""for questioning"" as much as they did his boss, Aguiyi-Ironsi. Fajuyi was seen as a so-called progressive, who had supported the Nzeogwu coup in January of that year. The bullet-riddled bodies of Ironsi and Fajuyi were later found in a nearby forest, and Yakubu Gowon became the new Military Head of State. "
wikipedia-1256462," FC Istres  Football Club Istres Ouest Provence (; commonly referred to as simply Istres) () is a French association football club based in Istres. The club was formed in 1920 and currently play in Ligue 2, the second level of French football having achieved promotion to the league following the 2008–09 season. Istres plays its home matches at the Stade Parsemain in Fos-sur-Mer, a commune in the Arrondissement of Istres. The team is managed by José Pasqualetti and captained by defender Gary Coulibaly. History. FC Istres was founded in 1920 by Édouard Guizonnier as SS Istréenne. In 1969, SS Istréenne was merged into the more general sports club Istres Sports, who chose to keep Istréenne's distinctive purple and black colors. In 1977 the club made young entrepreneur Michel Aviet the club's president and ex-Yugoslav goalkeeper Georges Korac the club's manager. During the Aviet-Korac years, the club advanced from France's lower regional divisions all the way up to Ligue 2. In 2004, the club reached Ligue 1 but finished last and was relegated to Ligue 2 the following year. The club returned to Ligue 2 for the 2009–10 season after winning the Championnat National 2008–09. Players. Current squad. ""As of 2 September, 2013."" Notable former players.

wikipedia-1256489," Glenn Ligon  Glenn Ligon is an American conceptual artist whose work explores race, language, desire, sexuality, and identity. Ligon engages in intertextuality with other works from the visual arts, literature, and history, as well as his own life. Early life and career. Ligon was born in 1960 in the Bronx. At the age of 7, his divorced, working-class parents got a scholarship for him and his brother to attend Walden School. Ligon graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in 1982. After graduating, he worked as a proof-reader for a law firm, while in his spare time he painted in the abstract Expressionist style of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. In 1985, he participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program. He currently lives and works in New York City. Work. Ligon works in multiple media, including painting, neon, video, photography, and digital media such as Adobe Flash for his work ""Annotations"". Ligon's work is greatly informed by his experiences as an African American and as a gay man living in the United States. Painting. Although Ligon's work spans sculptures, prints, drawings, mixed media and even neon signs, painting remains a core activity. His paintings incorporate literary fragments, jokes, and evocative quotes from a selection of authors, which he stencils directly onto the canvas by hand. In 1989, he mounted his first solo show, ""How It Feels to Be Colored Me,"" in Brooklyn. This show established Ligon's reputation for creating large, text-based paintings in which a phrase chosen from literature or other sources is repeated over and over, eventually dissipating into murk. ""Untitled (I Am a Man)"" (1988), a reinterpretation of the signs carried during the Memphis Sanitation Strike in 1968 — made famous by Ernest Withers’s photographs of the march —, is the first example of his use of text. Ligon gained prominence in the early 1990s along with a generation of artists like Lorna Simpson, Gary Simmons, and Janine Antoni. In 1993, Ligon began the first of three series of gold-colored paintings based on Richard Pryor's groundbreaking stand-up comedy routines from the 1970s. The scatological and racially charged jokes Ligon depicts speak in the vernacular language of the street and reveal a complex and nuanced vision of black culture. In 1994, the art installation ""To Disembark"" was shown at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. The title alludes to the title of a book of poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks. ""To Disembark"" functions in both works to evoke the recognition that African Americans are still coping with the remnants of slavery and its ongoing manifestation in racism. In one part of the installation, Ligon created a series of packing crates modeled on the one described by ex-slave Henry ""Box"" Brown in his ""Narrative of Henry Box Brown who escaped from Slavery Enclosed in a Box 3 Feet Long and 2 Wide."" Each crate played a different sound, such as a heartbeat, a spiritual, or contemporary rap music. Around each box, the artist placed posters in which he characterized himself, in words and period images, as a runaway slave in the style of 19th century broadsheets circulated to advertise for the return of fugitive slaves. In another part of the exhibition, Ligon stenciled four quotes from a Zora Neale Hurston essay, ""how it feels to be colored me,"" directly on the walls: ""I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background,"" ""I remember the very day that I became colored,"" ""I am not tragically colored,"" and ""I do not always feel colored."" Ligon found Hurston's writing illuminating because she explores the idea of race as a concept that is structured by context rather than essence. In ""A Feast of Scraps"" (1994–98), he inserted pornographic and stereotypical photographs of black men, complete with invented captions (""mother knew,"" ""I fell out"" ""It's a process"") into albums of family snapshots including graduation photographs, vacation snapshots, pictures of baby showers, birthday celebrations, and baptisms, some of which include the artist's own family. Like almost all of Ligon's art, this project draws out the secret histories and submerged meanings of inherited texts and images. For ""Notes on the Margin of the Black Book"" (1991–93), Ligon separately framed 91 erotic photographs of black males cut from Robert Mapplethorpe's 1988 ""Black Book,"" installing them in two horizontal rows. Between them are two more rows of small framed typed texts, 78 comments on sexuality, race, AIDS, art and the politically inflamed controversy over Mapplethorpe's work launched by then-Texas Congressman Dick Armey. Another series of large paintings was based on children's interpretations of 1970s black-history coloring books. Neon works. Since 2005, Ligon has made neon works. ""Warm Broad Glow"" (2005), Ligon’s first exploration in neon, uses a fragment of text from ""Three Lives"", the 1909 novel by American author Gertrude Stein. Ligon rendered the words “negro sunshine” in warm white neon, the letters of which were then painted black on the front. In 2008, the piece was selected to participate in the Renaissance Society's group exhibit, ""Black Is, Black Ain't""., and appeared on the Whitney Museum’s facade in 2011. Other neon works are derived from neon sculptures by Bruce Nauman; ""One Live and Die"" (2006) stems from Nauman’s ""100 Live and Die"" (1984), for example. Film. In 2009, Ligon completed short film based on Thomas Edison's 1903 silent film ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". Playing the character of Tom, Ligon had himself filmed re-creating the last scene of Edison's movie, which also provided his film's title: ""The Death of Tom."" But the film was incorrectly loaded in the hand-crank camera that the artist used so no imagery appeared on film. Embracing this apparent failure, Ligon decided to show his film as an abstract progression of lights and darks with a narrative suggested by the score composed and played by jazz musician Jason Moran. Exhibitions. Ligon's work has been the subject of exhibitions throughout the United States and Europe. Recent solo exhibition include the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2001); the Kunstverein München, Germany (2001), the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2000); the St. Louis Art Museum (2000); the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (1998); and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1996). A first survey of Ligon's work opened at The Power Plant in Toronto in June 2005 and traveled to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh; Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston; Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus; Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in Vancouver, and the Mudam in Luxembourg. The first comprehensive mid-career retrospective devoted to Ligon's work was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in 2011. Group shows in which Ligon has participated include the Whitney Biennial (1991 and 1993), Biennale of Sydney (1996), Venice Biennale (1997), Kwangju Biennale (2000), and documenta 11 (2002). Collections. Ligon's work is represented in many public collections including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Tate Modern, London; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. In 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington bought the painting ""Untitled (I Am a Man)"" (1988). In 2012, Ligon was commissioned to create the first site-specific artwork for the New School's University Center building, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The work will feature about 400 feet of text from Walt Whitman’s ""Leaves of Grass"" rendered in pink neon lights, running around the top of a wall in the center’s first-floor café. Recognition. In 2005, Ligon won an Alphonse Fletcher Foundation Fellowship for his art work. In 2006 he was awarded the Skowhegan Medal for Painting. In 2010, he won a United States Artists Fellow award. In 2009, President Barack Obama added Ligon's 1992 ""Black Like Me No. 2"", on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, to the White House collection, where it was installed in the President's private living quarters. The text in the selected painting is from John Howard Griffin's 1961 memoir ""Black Like Me"", the account of a white man's experiences traveling through the South after he had his skin artificially darkened. The words ""All traces of the Griffin I had been were wiped from existence"" are repeated in capital letters that progressively overlap until they coalesce as a field of black paint. Art market. On the occasion of Ben Stiller and David Zwirner’s ""Artists For Haiti"" charity auction at Christie's in 2011, Jennifer Aniston set a record prize for Glenn Ligon's work by purchasing his ""Stranger #44"" (2011). At $450,000, Aniston beat Ligon’s previous record of $434,500 for ""Invisible Man (Two Views)"" (1991), realized at Sotheby's in September 2010. Ligon is represented by Regen Projects in Los Angeles; Luhring Augustine in New York; and Thomas Dane Gallery in London. "
wikipedia-1256547," Tajuddin Ahmad  Tajuddin Ahmad () (July 23, 1925 – November 3, 1975) was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman who served as the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh. He was a prominent leader of the Awami League party and served as its General Secretary during the critical period of the Bangladesh independence movement.  Ahmad was instrumental in forming the Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, popularly known as the Mujibnagar Government, during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After the independence of Bangladesh, Tajuddin served as Finance Minister until 1974. After the assassination of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 1975, Tajuddin was arrested by the military government and executed by a group of renegade army officers in Dhaka Central Jail on 3 November 1975.  Named as ""one of the most influential political leaders in the history of Bangladesh"", he is highly regarded by Bangladeshis for his leadership of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh in 1971 and for being a staunch secular democrat. Early life. Family. Tajuddin born in a middle class conservative Muslim family. His father was Moulavi Muhammad Yasin Khan and his mother Meherunnesa Khanam. There were ten brothers and sisters—four brothers and six sisters. Education. His education began at the village maktab (religious school) founded by his father. Later on he was enrolled in Bhuleswar Primary School, two kilometers from the family house. When he was in class (grade) four he was enrolled in Kapasia Minor English School, a distance of five kilometers from Dardoria. His enrollment at this school was due to the encouragement of his mother. While a student at Kapasia M.E. School Tajuddin drew the attention of three senior revolutionary leaders who had dedicated their lives to liberating their country from the British rule. They were impressed by Tajuddin’s merit and planted the seed of patriotism in young Tajuddin’s heart. They recommended to his teachers that their student be sent on to a better school. Accordingly he was admitted into St. Nicholas Institution in Kalinganj. At this school, as well, he so distinguished himself that the headmaster advised that he be admitted into Muslim Boys’ School in Dhaka, and then he went on to St. Gregory’s High School. He passed his matriculation exam in first division while earning a twelfth position in merit list nationwide in 1944 from St. Gregory's High School in Kolkata Board. He earned fourth position in his Matriculation examinations in 1948 and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in Economics from Dhaka University in 1953. He also later obtained a law degree. He studied the Quran and, becoming a ""Hafidh"". Political career. Ahmad organized protests and other activities during the Language Movement of 1952. He was arrested by police and imprisoned for several months. After his release, he was elected to the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly in 1954 but was arrested following the dismissal of the A. K. Fazlul Huq-led government. He would be arrested again following the imposition of martial law by Ayub Khan in 1958 after taking power in a military coup. Ahmed worked in the pro-democracy campaign led by the Awami League and other political parties in Pakistan. He organized protests against the arrest of Mujib in 1966 on charges of sedition. He participated at the round table conference in Rawalpindi convened by Ayub Khan to resolve the crisis between the government and the opposition parties. Following the restoration of democracy, he was elected member of the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1970.  Following the arrest of Mujib on March 25, 1971 by the Pakistan Army, which continued to kill civilians, Ahmad organized a government-in-exile popularly known as the Mujibnagar government to win his nation freedom. Ahmad named the capital Mujibnagar, after Shaikh Mujibur Rahman. The oath taking ceremony of the first government of Bangladesh took place on the soil of Bangladesh, in Meherpur, Kushtia on April 17, 1971. He presided over the significant Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971 that created and formed the entire Bangladesh Forces under the command of General M. A. G. Osmani. As the first Prime Minister he led efforts to organize a guerrilla insurgency of Bengali civilians and armed forces and win international support. During this period, Ahmad encountered vehement intra party strife led by Khandokar Mushataq Ahmad who conspired to harm the national struggle for independence through a failed attempt to form a confederacy with Pakistan. Among Ahmad's great diplomatic achievements were to win international support and recognition of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation by the government of India. After the independence of Bangladesh, Ahmad returned to Dhaka on 22 December 1971. In the subsequent cabinet formed under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ahmad was given charge of the ministries of finance and planning. He was also appointed member of the committee in charge of writing the Constitution of Bangladesh. However, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was influenced to question the integrity of Tajuddin for the party and for himself by the parties within the Awami League who were proved redundant during the Liberation war. Tajuddin was widely publicized by them to be a stooge of the neighbouring Indian government probably because of the respect he commanded from Mrs Gandhi, the then prime minister of India and also for his declared gratefulness for the assistance that India gave during the war. The sycophants of Mujib also portrayed Tajuddin as aspiring to be the next Prime Minister of the country. Khondokar Mushtaque who was a pro-Pakistan conspirator during the war led the effort to malign Mr. Tajuddin. He had active support from the student leadership who also had contempt for Tajuddin as they too were restrained by him from taking advantage of the situation during the war. Till today Awami League failed to evaluate Tajuddin Ahmad's role. Assassination. When Mujib assumed the title of President and banned other political parties in 1975, Ahmad opposed the forming of a one-party system known as BAKSAL. When Mujib was assassinated by a group of army officers on 15 August 1975, Ahmad was immediately placed under house arrest. On August 22, he was arrested with other political leaders by the regime of the new president Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed and imprisoned at the Dhaka Central Jail. On November 3, in what became infamously known as the ""Jail Killing Day"", Ahmad along with Syed Nazrul Islam, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman and Muhammad Mansur Ali were killed at midnight by a group of army officers on the instruction of President Ahmed. The release on March 25, 2007 of a documentary, ""Tajuddin Ahmad: An Unsung Hero"" (directed by Tanvir Mokammel), reflects a growing interest in the life and works of Ahmad. On January 6, 2009, Ahmad's son Tanzim Ahmed, was appointed Minister of State for Home Affairs, in the Awami League Administration. "
wikipedia-1256550," Benjamin Mays  Benjamin Elijah Mays (August 1, 1894 – March 28, 1984) was a United States minister, educator, scholar, social activist and the president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia from 1940 to 1967. Mays was also a significant mentor to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and was among the most articulate and outspoken critics of segregation before the rise of the modern civil rights movement in the United States. Biography. Early Life & Education. Benjamin Elijah Mays was born in 1894 in Ninety Six, South Carolina, the youngest of eight children; his parents were tenant farmers and former slaves. As a child, seeing his father threatened by a white mob on horseback in the aftermath of the Phoenix Election Riot made a deep impression. After spending a year at Virginia Union University, he moved north to attend Bates College in Maine, where he obtained his B.A. in 1920, then entered the University of Chicago as a graduate student, earning an M.A. in 1925 and a Ph.D. in the School of Religion in 1935. His education at Chicago was interrupted several times: he was ordained a Baptist minister in 1922 and accepted a pastorate at the Shiloh Baptist Church of Atlanta, then later taught at Morehouse and at South Carolina State College.  While in graduate school mays worked as a Pullman Porter. He also worked as a student assistant to Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams, pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago and President of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. Career. While working on his doctorate, Mays and Joseph Nicholson published a study entitled ""The Negro's Church"", the first sociological study of the black church in the United States. Four years later in 1938, he published ""The Negro's God as Reflected in His Literature"".  In 1926, he was appointed executive secretary of the Tampa, Florida Urban League. After two years at this post he became National Student Secretary of the YMCA.  Mays accepted the position of dean of the School of Religion at Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1934. During his six years as dean, Mays traveled to India, where, at the urging of Howard Thurman, a fellow professor at Howard, he spoke at some length with Mahatma Gandhi.  In 1940, Mays became the president of Morehouse College. His most famous student there was Martin Luther King Jr. The two developed a close relationship that continued until King's death in 1968; As his lifelong mentor, Mays delivered the eulogy for King. Mays final stop in academia was at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, SC. Mays emphasized two themes throughout his life: the dignity of all human beings and the gap between American democratic ideals and American social practices. Those became key elements of the message of King and the American civil rights movement. Mays explored these themes at length in his book ""Seeking to Be a Christian in Race Relations"", published in 1957.  Mays gave the benediction at the close of the official program of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. After his retirement in 1967 from Morehouse, Mays was elected president of the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education, where he supervised the peaceful desegregation of Atlanta's public schools. He published two autobiographies, ""Born to Rebel"" (1971), and ""Lord, the People Have Driven Me On"" (1981). In 1982, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Benjamin E. Mays High School in Atlanta, The Mays Hall of Howard University (where the School of Divinity is housed), and the Benjamin Mays Center at Bates College are named in Mays' honor, as well as Benjamin E. Mays International Magnet School in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mays died in Atlanta on March 28, 1984. He was entombed on the campus of Morehouse College. His wife Sadie is entombed beside him. Mays was a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Benjamin Mays on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. The Mays family has initiated a petition to honor Dr. Mays’ legacy through a nomination for the high honor of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. "
wikipedia-1256558," GNU Zebra  Zebra is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing services with routing protocols support such as RIP, OSPF and BGP. Zebra also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior. In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Zebra also supports IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX protocol, Zebra provides routing protocol management information bases. Zebra uses an advanced software architecture to provide a high quality, multi server routing engine. Zebra has an interactive user interface for each routing protocol and supports common client commands. Due to this design, new protocol daemons can be easily added. Zebra library can also be used as a program's client user interface. Zebra is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Background. The idea for Zebra originally came from Kunihiro Ishiguro, after he realized the need for quality routing software. While working at an ISP joint venture between British Telecom and Marubeni, Ishiguro encountered venture capitalist Yoshinari Yoshikawa. Yoshinari Yoshikawa shared Ishiguro's vision for a new routing engine and they combined resources to create the world's first routing engine software. The resulting entity, known as the Zebra Project, was started in 1996. Present. Ishiguro and Yoshikawa lead the IP Infusion company and market a commercial version of Zebra, known as ""ZebOS"". This ZebOS is being used in networking products, such as the Citrix NetScaler. Future. Since its last release (version 0.95) in 2005-09-08, development of Zebra appears to have stopped. A new project has emerged as the unofficial successor of Zebra: Quagga. Worldwide, many Linux/BSD based BGP-routers which were using Zebra are switching to Quagga. The OpenBSD project created its own routing suites. OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD were developed as an alternative to Linux-focused routing suites such as Quagga, because they don't meet the OpenBSD project's requirements and quality standards. "
wikipedia-1256559," Facial nerve paralysis  Facial nerve paralysis is a common problem that involves the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve. The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted, and so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis. The most common is Bell's palsy, an idiopathic disease that may only be diagnosed by exclusion. A thorough medical history and physical examination are the first steps in making a diagnosis. During the physical examination, a distinction must first be made between paralysis and paresis (incomplete paralysis). Not surprisingly, paralysis is far more serious and requires immediate treatment. It must also be determined whether the forehead is involved in the motor defect or not. This is usually accomplished by assessing how well a patient can raise his or her eyebrows. The question is an important one because it helps determine if the lesion is in the upper motor neuron component of the facial nerve, or in its lower motor neuron component. If the mimetic muscles do not contract anymore, facial nerve surgery is indicated, for example smile surgery. Laboratory investigations include an audiogram, nerve conduction studies (ENoG), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Causes. Supranuclear and nuclear lesions. Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. Infranuclear lesions. Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis (>80%). Previously considered idiopathic, it has been recently linked to herpes simplex infection. Another more severe form of facial palsy, called Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, is linked to herpes zoster infection of the facial nerve. Other, less common, etiologies are Lyme disease polio, TB. Bell's palsy is an exclusion diagnosis. Some factors that tend to rule out Bell's palsy include: Bell's palsy is believed in the most recent studies to be due to herpes virus. Other proposed etiologies include vascular problems in the inner ear. Treatment includes steroids and antivirals. Trauma. Physical trauma, especially fractures of the temporal bone, may also cause acute facial nerve paralysis. Understandably, the likelihood of facial paralysis after trauma depends on the location of the trauma. Most commonly, facial paralysis follows temporal bone fractures, though the likelihood depends on the type of fracture. ""Transverse fractures"" in the horizontal plane present the highest likelihood of facial paralysis (40-50%). Patients may also present with hemotympanum (blood behind the tympanic membrane), sensory deafness, and vertigo – the latter two symptoms due to damage to vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) and the inner ear. ""Longitudinal fracture"" in the vertical plane present a lower likelihood of paralysis (20%). Patients may present with hematorrhea (blood coming out of the external auditory meatus), tympanic membrane tear, fracture of external auditory canal, and conductive hearing loss. Traumatic injuries can be assessed by computed tomography (CT) and nerve conduction studies (ENoG). In patients with mild injury, management is the same as with Bell's palsy – protect the eyes and wait. In patients with severe injury, progress is followed with nerve conduction studies. If nerve conduction studies show a large (>90%) change in nerve conduction, the nerve should be decompressed. The facial paralysis can follow immediately the trauma due to direct damage to the facial nerve, in such cases a surgical treatment may be attempted. In other cases the facial paralysis can occur a long time after the trauma due to oedema and inflammation. In those cases steroids can be a good help. Herpes zoster oticus. Herpes zoster oticus is essentially a herpes zoster infection that affects cranial nerves VII (facial nerve) and VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve). Patients present with facial paralysis, ear pain, vesicles, sensorineural hearing loss, and vertigo. Management includes Antiviral drugs and oral steroids. Acute and chronic otitis media. Otitis media is an infection in the middle ear, which can spread to the facial nerve and inflame it, causing compression of the nerve in its canal. Antibiotics are used to control the ""otitis media"", and other options include a wide myringotomy (an incision in the tympanic membrane) or decompression if the patient does not improve. Chronic ""otitis media"" usually presents in an ear with chronic discharge (otorrhea), or hearing loss, with or without ear pain (otalgia). Once suspected, there should be immediate surgical exploration to determine if a cholesteatoma has formed as this must be removed if present. Inflammation from the middle ear can spread to the canalis facialis of the temporal bone - through this canal travels the facial nerve together with the steatoacoustisus nerve. In the case of inflammation the nerve is exposed to edema and subsequent high pressure, resulting in a periferic type palsy. Neurosarcoidosis. Facial nerve paralysis, sometimes bilateral, is a common manifestation of neurosarcoidosis (sarcoidosis of the nervous system), itself a rare condition. Moebius syndrome. Moebius syndrome is a bilateral facial paralysis resulting from the underdevelopment of the VII cranial nerve (facial nerve), which is present at birth. The VI cranial nerve, which controls lateral eye movement, is also affected, so people with Moebius syndrome cannot form facial expression or move their eyes from side to side. Moebius syndrome is extremely rare, and its cause or causes are not known. Multiple. Tumors. A tumor compressing the facial nerve anywhere along its complex pathway can result in facial paralysis. Common culprits are facial neuromas, congenital cholesteatomas, hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, parotid gland neoplasms, or metastases of other tumours. Patients with facial nerve paralysis resulting from tumours usually present with a progressive, twitching paralysis, other neurological signs, or a recurrent Bell's palsy-type presentation. The latter should always be suspicious, as Bell's palsy should not recur. A chronically discharging ear must be treated as a cholesteatoma until proven otherwise; hence, there must be immediate surgical exploration. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging should be used to identify the location of the tumour, and it should be managed accordingly. Often, since facial neoplasms have such an intimate relationship with the facial nerve, removing tumors in this region becomes perplexing as the physician is unsure how to manage the tumor without causing even more palsy. Typically, benign tumors should be removed in a fashion that preserves the facial nerve, while malignant tumors should always be resected along with large areas of tissue around them, including the facial nerve. While this will inevitably lead to heightened paralysis, safe removal of a malignant neoplasm is worth the often treatable palsy that follows. In the best case scenario, paralysis can be corrected with techniques including hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, end-to-end nerve repair, cross facial nerve grafting, or muscle transfer/transposition techniques, such as the gracilis free muscle transfer.

wikipedia-1256573," Aouzou Strip  The Aouzou Strip (; Arabic قطاع أوزو, alternatively Aozou Strip) is a strip of land in northern Chad which lies along the border with Libya, extending south to a depth of about 100 kilometers into Chad's Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region for an area of 114,000 km². The region played a significant role in the Chadian–Libyan conflict. Inclusion in Italian Libya. The Aouzou strip was defined for the first time in the discussions between France and Italy after World War I, in relation to an award to Italy for the victory in that war. At the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Kingdom of Italy did not receive any of the German colonies, but instead was given the Oltre Giuba from Great Britain, and France agreed to give some Saharan territories to Italian Libya. After many discussions during the 1920s, in 1935 the Franco-Italian Agreement was signed between Benito Mussolini and Pierre Laval, which included a provision under which Italy would receive the Aouzou strip, which was to be added to Libya. France's other motivations in concluding this agreement with Italy were to settle the status of the Italian Tunisian community in its protectorate of the country, to remove irredentist Italian claims to Nice, and to prevent Italy from growing closer to Nazi Germany by keeping it closely aligned with France and the United Kingdom (the Stresa Front). This policy failed two years later after Italy drifted into the German orbit by concluding the Pact of Steel with Nazi Germany, leading to the ""instruments of ratification"" of the Mussolini-Laval Treaty never being exchanged with France. Despite this the new border was conventionally assumed to be the southern boundary of Libya until 1955. History. Claimed to be rich in uranium deposits, the area was the cause of dispute with Libya, which led to a war between the two countries. In 1973, Libya engaged in military operations in the Aouzou Strip to gain access to minerals and to use it as a base of influence in Chadian politics. This ultimately resulted in the Chadian–Libyan conflict. Libya argued that the territory was inhabited by indigenous people who owed vassalage to the Senoussi Order and subsequently to the Ottoman Empire, and that this title had been inherited by Libya. It also supported its claim with an unratified 1935 treaty between France and Italy (the ""Mussolini-Laval Treaty""), the colonial powers of Chad and Libya, respectively, that confirmed the possession of the strip by Italy. After consolidating its hold on the strip, Libya annexed it in 1936. The frontier claimed by the Chadian government was based on a 1955 treaty between France and Libya, which, in turn, referred back to an 1899 agreement between Great Britain and France about ""spheres of influence"". Despite other differences, this was one position on which all Chadian political parties and factions were able to agree. During the so-called Toyota War in 1987, the final stage of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, Chadian forces were able to force the Libyans to retreat from the Aouzou Strip. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, followed by unsuccessful negotiations over the next several years. Finally a 1994 International Court of Justice decision found (by a majority of 16 to 1) in favour of Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, and ended the Libyan claim. The United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Aouzou Strip Observer Group in Resolution 915 (May 1994) to monitor the withdrawal of Libyan troops, and was terminated in Resolution 926 (June 1994) when it was completed.

wikipedia-1256577," Tellabs  Tellabs, Inc. is a telecommunications company that designs, develops and supports telecommunications networking products. The company serves telecommunications service providers (including mobile wireless communication companies), independent operating companies, multiple-system operator cable companies, enterprises and government agencies. The company has ranked among the BusinessWeek InfoTech 100. Tellabs is part of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index and the S&P Midcap 400. Over one third of the world's wireless calls travel via networks owned by Tellabs customers such as T-Mobile and Verizon Communications History. Tellabs traces its roots to a meeting in 1975 over a kitchen table in suburban Chicago.  In a booklet on Tellabs' first quarter century, ""Twenty-Five Years of Clear Ideas: Tellabs 1975-2000"", founder Michael Birck, the first chief executive officer and still chairman, described the formation of the company. Birck said that six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. He said they wanted to build a company that offered customers products and services that met their specific needs. The partners raised $110,000 in capital. They incorporated as Tellabs in the spring of 1975. The name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, a second-hand soldering iron picked up for $25 and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making echo suppressors, which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. Family members supported the new company by mortgaging their homes, cleaning Tellabs' offices and even posing as assembly line workers when potential customers were taken through the “plant.” Birck said, “None of the six of us gave any thought whatsoever to where we'd be 25 years hence--we were far more concerned with surviving the first year or two….We ended that first year with 20 employees, US$312,000 in sales and a modest loss.” Tellabs continued to grow, adding plants and expanding its product line. Hambrecht & Quist of San Francisco took the company public in July 1980. Tellabs ended 1980 with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry's first echo canceller, an advance over the original echo suppressors that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million. Expands products, makes acquisitions. Tellabs made several acquisitions and expanded globally in the 1980s and into the 1990s, including Coherent Communications Systems Corp. and Martis Oy in Finland. In 1991, the company took a new direction, releasing its SONET-based TITAN 5500 digital cross-connect system. These systems switch traffic from one circuit to another, connecting traffic inside and between networks. SiliconIndia confirmed the Titan's success: “The product was superior to all others on the market and rapidly gained customer acceptance at a number of blue chip companies including MCI Inc., Sprint, the various RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies), various cellular, paging and data service providers. Through the 1990s, Tellabs enjoyed rapid sales growth and was one of the top 10 stocks in all performance from 1991-1999. Sales increased tenfold from under $200 million to more than $2 billion and profitability increased more than twentyfold over that period.” In 1995, as the Internet was emerging, Tellabs launched its first Web site at www.tellabs.com. That year, when the company had $600 million in revenue, Birck set a goal of “$2B by 2K”: $2 billion in revenue by the year 2000. When that objective was met during the telecom boom in 1999, Birck upped the goal to boost Tellabs from $2 billion in revenues in 2000 to $6 billion in 2003. The ""$6 Billion Man"" arrives, with the telecom bust. Richard Notebaert, who had led Ameritech, the Midwestern AT&T spin-off until it was acquired by SBC in 1999, took over Tellabs as CEO in September 2000. Notebaert was dubbed by news media as the “$6 billion man.” But it wasn't to be, as the telecom industry went into a nosedive. The Chicago Sun-Times reported: “Telecom went from boom to bust as venture capital dried up and customers cancelled orders for the sort of equipment made by Tellabs and its competitors, including Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies.” Notebaert confirmed the $6 billion goal wouldn't be met: ""Not by '03. Not unless we do some serious acquiring."" The ""Chicago Sun-Times"" said his job description changed “from empire builder to cost-cutter as he trimmed Tellabs' sails to ride out the recessionary storm.” Notebaert left Tellabs to run Qwest in 2002. In 2003, following industry trends and after 28 years as a manufacturer, Tellabs sold its last plant in Illinois and outsourced its manufacturing. The company continued downsizing its operation. Prabhu takes Tellabs in new directions. Krish Prabhu, former chief operating officer of Alcatel, took over as CEO in February 2004. Prabhu led the company in new directions to meet needs created by the public's growing use of the Internet and faster connections, enabling video and better VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calling. Tellabs acquired Advanced Fibre Communications (AFC), which made access gear linking phone companies to homes and small businesses. By 2006, Tellabs stated that more than half of wireless calls were being made on networks owned by Tellabs' customers. By 2007, nearly half of Tellabs' revenue came from products added since 2003. Prabhu also presided over more cutbacks as the telecom industry continued to struggle. In January 2008, Tellabs announced that it was cutting 225 jobs during the year. This would leave Tellabs with about 3,500 jobs, down from a peak of 9,000 during the boom in 2001. Prabhu stepped down in March 2008 for personal reasons. He said in announcing his departure: ""The Tellabs team has successfully broadened the product portfolio, established new relationships with large service providers, and made progress in repositioning the company. This is the right time for a new leader to begin the next chapter at Tellabs."" Birck said Prabhu was a good strategic planner, creating a ""formidable"" product line, especially digital products that enable Tellabs' telephone company customers to deliver video and other services to consumers' homes. He said industry consolidation made it difficult for suppliers to be profitable. He said the telephone companies ""know how to wring it out of you. It's happening to all the suppliers."" Birck told the Chicago Sun-Times: ""Honestly, this industry in its current state kind of wore the guy down."" The Pullen Years. Robert W. Pullen 45, who had 23 years of experience at Tellabs in research and development, sales, and services, took over as chief executive and president on March 1, 2008. He started his career at Tellabs in 1985 as an electrical engineer and had been senior vice president of optical networking. He was Chairman of the executive board of Telecommunications Industry Association. Tellabs acquired WiChorus, a Silicon Valley start-up with a mobile packet core platform, in 2009. WiChorus is based out of San Jose. Pullen died of cancer at age 50 on July 2, 2012. Corporate affairs. Tellabs has its corporate headquarters in Naperville, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. It also has representation in 30 countries. Products and services. Along with its stand-alone products, Tellabs offers integrated “solutions” with a variety of functions. Its equipment helps wireless providers handle increased traffic and allows phone companies to offer voice, data and video services to residential homes over fiber connections. Tellabs solutions (products) and services include: Some of Tellabs' customers include Verizon Communications, BellSouth, NTT Communications of Japan, British Telecommunications of United Kingdom, T-Mobile (globally), Telekom Malaysia, Telstra of Australia, Telkom South Africa, Telecom Italia and Vodafone (globally).

wikipedia-1256582," Qarmatians  The Qarmatians ( ""Qarāmita"" ""Those Who Wrote in Small Letters""; also transliterated ""were a Shi'a Ismaili group centered in eastern Arabia, where they attempted to establish a utopian republic in 899 CE. They are most famed for their revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate. Mecca was sacked by the sect’s leader Ṭāhir Sulaymān, outraging the great majority of other Muslims, particularly with their theft of the Black Stone and desecration of the Well of Zamzam with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE. The Qarāmiṭah were also known as ""the Greengrocers"" (""al-Baqliyyah"") because of their strict vegetarian habits. History. Early developments. Under the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE), various Shī‘ī groups organised in secret opposition to their rule. Among them were the supporters of the proto-Ismā‘īlī community, of whom the most prominent group were called the ""Mubārakiyyah"". According to the Ismaili school of thought, Imām Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (702–765) designated his second son, Isma'il ibn Jafar (ca. 721–755), as heir to the Imamate. However, Ismā‘īl predeceased his father. Some claimed he had gone into hiding, but the proto-Ismā‘īlī group accepted his death and therefore accordingly recognized Ismā‘īl's eldest son, Muḥammad ibn Ismā‘īl (746–809), as Imām. He remained in contact with the Mubārakiyyah group, most of whom resided in Kūfah. The split among the Mubārakiyyah came with the death of Muḥammad ibn Ismā‘īl (ca. 813 CE). The majority of the group denied his death; they recognized him as the Mahdi. The minority believed in his death and would eventually emerge in later times as the Fāṭimid Ismā‘īlī, the precursors to all modern groups. The majority Ismā‘īlī missionary movement settled in Salamiyah (in present-day Syria) and had great success in Khuzestan (Southwestern Persia), where the Ismā‘īlī leader al-Husayn al-Ahwāzī converted the Kūfan man Ḥamdān in 874 CE, who took the name ""Qarmaṭ"" after his new faith. Qarmaṭ and his theologian brother-in-law ‘Abdān prepared southern Iraq for the coming of the Mahdi by creating a military and religious stronghold. Other such locations grew up in Yemen, in Bahrain in 899 CE and in North Africa. These attracted many new Shī‘ī followers due to their activist and messianic teachings. This new proto-Qarmaṭī movement continued to spread into Greater Iran and then into Transoxiana. The Qarmatian Revolution. A change in leadership in Salamiyyah in 899 led to a split in the movement. The minority Ismā‘īlīs, whose leader had taken control of the Salamiyyah centre, began to proclaim their teachings - that Imām Muḥammad ""had"" died, and that the new leader in Salamiyyah was in fact his descendant come out of hiding. Qarmaṭ and his brother-in-law opposed this and openly broke with the Salamiyyids; when ‘Abdān was assassinated, he went into hiding and subsequently repented. Qarmaṭ became a missionary of the new Imām, Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (873–934), who founded the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa in 909. Nonetheless, the dissident group retained the name Qarmaṭī. Their greatest stronghold remained in Bahrain, which at this period included much of eastern Arabia as well as the islands that comprise the present state, was under Abbasid control at the end of the ninth century, but a slave rebellion in Basra disrupted the power of Baghdad. The Qarmaṭians seized their opportunity under their leader, Abū-Saʿīd Jannābī, who captured Bahrain’s capital Hajr and al-Hasa in 899, which he made the capital of his republic and once in control of the state he sought to set up a utopian society. The Qarmaṭians instigated what one scholar termed a ""century of terrorism"" in Kufa. They considered the pilgrimage to Mecca a superstition and once in control of the Bahraini state they launched raids along the pilgrim routes crossing Arabia: in 906 they ambushed the pilgrim caravan returning from Mecca and massacred 20,000 pilgrims. Under Abu Tahir Al-Jannabi (ruled 923–944) the Qarmaṭians came close to raiding Baghdad in 927 and sacked Mecca and Medina in 930. The assault on Islam's holiest sites saw the Qarmatians desecrate the Well of Zamzam with corpses of Hajj pilgrims and take the Black Stone from Mecca to Al-Hasa. Holding the Black Stone to ransom they forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return in 952. The revolution and desecration shocked the Muslim world and humiliated the Abbasids. But little that could be done; for much of the tenth century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, controlling the coast of Oman and collecting tribute from the caliph in Baghdad as well as from a rival Ismaili imam in Cairo, whom they did not recognize. Qarmatian society. The Qarmatians aimed to build a society based on reason and equality. The state was governed by a council of six with a chief who was a first among equals. All property within the community was distributed evenly among all initiates. The Qarmatians were organized as an esoteric society but not as a secret one. Their activities were public and openly propagated, but new members had to undergo an initiation ceremony involving seven stages. In an echo of cyclical Mazdean thought, the Qarmatian world view was one where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again. The land they ruled over was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash: The sack of Mecca followed millenarian fervour among the Qarmatians (as well as in Persia) over the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 928—an event which the Qarmat leader Abū Ṭāhir al-Ḏj̲annābī believed indicated the end of the epoch of Islam and the beginning of the final religious era. The year 931 was also highly important for the Qarmatians' mahdi fervor, as it was 1,500 years after the prophet Zoroaster's death and the end of the epoch of Alexander, which predicted the reign of the Magians. Therefore, in 931 Abu Tahir handed over power to a young Persian man whom he believed to be the awaited mahdi. This new Persian Qarmatian leader acted unexpectedly, forbidding Islamic law and prayer, ordering the cursing of many imams and Muslim prophets, supported the worship of fire, killed prominent Qarmati leaders, and proclaimed a religion centered on Adam, the first man. The expected mahdi ruled only 80 days; Abu Tahir had no choice but to kill him, though his bizarre rule severely destabilized the Qarmatian movement. Collapse. After defeat by the Abbasids in 976 the Qarmatians began to look inwards and their status was reduced to that of a local power. This had important repercussions for the Qarmatians' ability to extract tribute from the region; according to Arabist historian Curtis Larsen: In Bahrain and eastern Arabia the Qarmatian state was replaced by the Uyunid dynasty, while it is believed that by the middle of the eleventh century Qarmatian communities in Iraq, Iran and Transoxiana had either been won over by Fatimid proselytising or had disintegrated. The last contemporary mention of the Qarmatians is that of Nasir ibn Khosrau, who visited them in 1050, although Ibn Battuta, visiting Qatif in 1331, found it inhabited by Arab tribes whom he described as ""extremist Shi`is"" (""rafidhiyya ghulat""), which historian Juan Cole has suggested is how a 14th Century Sunni would describe Ismailis. Religious beliefs. There is a general tendency in the Sunnite and Shiite sources, when referring to the Ismailis, often erroneously call them Qarmatians without perception of the distinction between them. "
wikipedia-1256600," Cultural periods of Peru  This is a chart of cultural periods of Peru and the Andean Region developed by Edward Lanning and used by some archaeologists studying the area. An alternative dating system was developed by Luis Lumbreras and provides different dates for some archaeological finds. Most of the cultures of the Late Horizon and some of the cultures of the Late Intermediate joined the Inca Empire by 1493, but the period ends in 1534 because that marks the fall of the Inca empire after the Spanish conquest. Most of the cut-off years mark either an end of a severe drought or the beginning of one. These marked a shift of the most productive farming to or from the mountains, and tended to mark the end of one culture and the rise of another. The more recent findings concerning the Norte Chico civilization are not included on this list, as it was compiled before the site at Caral was investigated in detail. Alternative timeline by Luis Lumbreras: "
wikipedia-1256620," Electrocyclic reaction  In organic chemistry, an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic rearrangement where the net result is one pi bond being converted into one sigma bond or vice-versa. These reactions are usually categorized by the following criteria: Classical Examples. The Nazarov cyclization reaction is a named electrocyclic reaction converting divinylketones to cyclopentenones. A classic example is the thermal ring-opening reaction of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene. The cis isomer exclusively yields ""cis,trans-2,4-hexadiene"" whereas the trans isomer gives the trans,trans diene: This reaction course can be explained in a simple analysis through the frontier-orbital method: the sigma bond in the reactant will open in such a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product (a butadiene). The only way to accomplish this is through a conrotatory ring-opening which results in opposite signs for the terminal lobes. Stereospecificity of ring-closing reactions. When performing an electrocyclic reaction it is sometimes desirable to predict the cis/trans geometry of the reaction's product. The first step in this process is to determine whether a reaction proceeds through conrotation or disrotation. Although the mechanism of these reactions is complex, only two pieces of information are needed to predict conrotation or disrotation. For the example given below, the thermal reaction of (trans,cis,trans)-octa-2,4,6-triene will happen through a disrotatory mechanism. After determining the type of rotation, whether the product will be cis or trans can be determined by examining the starting molecule. In the example below, the disrotation causes both methyls to point upwards, causing the product to be cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene. In addition, the torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction of rotation. For example, a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions, producing enantiomeric products. A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess. Stereospecificity of ring-opening reactions. The rules for the conrotation or disrotation of a ring-closing reaction are different than for a ring-opening reaction. In effect, each entry of the table is switched from conrotatory to disrotatory, and vice versa.  If the reaction shown above (octatriene to cis-cyclohexadiene) was performed in reverse, then cis-cyclohexadiene would undergo a ring-opening reaction. Examining the rules for ring-openings, the thermal reaction of a 4n molecule would proceed through a disrotatory mechanism. Further analysis shows that the product would be (trans,cis,trans)-octa-2,4,6-triene. This demonstrates how these reactions are actually an equilibrium between the cyclic and acyclic molecules. The above information and reasoning on ""Stereospecificity of ring-opening reactions"" is overcomplicating the problem. The rules of conrotation and disrotation are the same regardless of the reaction being an electrocylic ring-opening or ring-closing. With regard to the octatriene to cis-cyclohexadiene system, the ring-opening and closing should always be thought of as a ""4n+2"" electron process and thus disrotatory in both directions, in agreement with the unmodified table as shown in the ""Stereospecificity of ring-closing reactions"" above. Mechanism of thermal reactions. Woodward-Hoffman Rules. Correlation diagrams, which connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry, can then be constructed for the two processes. These correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene is symmetry allowed whereas only a disrotatory ring opening of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is symmetry allowed. This is because only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition state. Also, the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an excited state. Frontier molecular orbital Theory. According to the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory, the sigma bond in the ring will open in such a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product. For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, only a disrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene. For the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene, on the other hand, only a conrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene. Mechanism of photochemical reactions. If the ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene were carried out under photochemical conditions the resulting electrocyclization would be occur via a disrotatory mode instead of a conrotatory mode as can be seen by the correlation diagram for the allowed excited state ring opening reaction. Only a disrotatory mode, in which symmetry about a reflection plane is maintained throughout the reaction, would result in maximum orbital overlap in the transition state. Also, once again, this would result in the formation of a product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited state of the reactant compound. Electrocyclic Reactions in Biological Systems. Electrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature. One of the most common such electrocyclizations is the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. The first step involves a photochemically induced conrotatory ring opening of 7-dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3. A [1,7]-hydride shift then forms vitamin D3. Another example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin, a naturally occurring oxepine, and its related compounds. Enzymatic epoxidation of phenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine forms the arene oxide, which undergoes a 6π disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon, forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in aranotin and its related compounds. The benzonorcaradiene diterpenoid (A) was rearranged into the benzocycloheptatriene diterpenoid isosalvipuberlin (B) by boiling a methylene chloride solution. This transformation can be envisaged as a disrotatory electrocyclic reaction, followed by two suprafacial 1,5-simatropic hydrogen shifts, as shown below. Electrocyclic reactions in organic synthesis. An often studied electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring-opening of benzocyclobutane. The reaction product is a very unstable ortho-quinodimethane but this molecule can be trapped in an endo addition with a strong dienophile such as maleic anhydride to the Diels-Alder adduct. The chemical yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in ""scheme 2"" is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R. With a reaction solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110°C, the yield increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to trimethylsilylmethyl. The increased reaction rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by silicon hyperconjugation as the βC-Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C-C bond by donating electrons.  An biomimetic electrocyclic cascade reaction was discovered in relation to the isolation and synthesis of certain endiandric acids:  Asymmetric electrocyclic reactions are an emerging field in contemporary organic synthesis. The most commonly studied reactions in this field are the 4π Staudinger β-lactam synthesis and the 4π Nazarov reaction; asymmetric catalysis of both reactions have been controlled by use of a chiral auxiliary, and the Nazarov reaction has been performed catalytically using chiral Lewis acids, Brønsted acids and chiral amines. "
wikipedia-1256645," Cycloaddition  A cycloaddition is a pericyclic chemical reaction, in which ""two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity."" The resulting reaction is a cyclization reaction. Many but not all cycloadditions are concerted. Cycloadditions are usually described by the backbone size of the participants. This would make the Diels-Alder reaction a (4 + 2)cycloaddition, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a (3 + 2)cycloaddition and cyclopropanation of a carbene with an alkene a (2+1)cycloaddition. This type of reaction is non-polar addition reaction. Reaction mechanism. Thermal cycloadditions are those cycloadditions where the reactants are in the ground electronic state. They usually have (4n + 2) π electrons participating in the starting material, for some integer n. These reactions occur, for reasons of orbital symmetry, in a suprafacial-suprafacial or antarafacial-antarafacial manner (rare). There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n π electrons (for example the + 2 cycloaddition); these proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense, such as the dimerisation of ketene, in which the orthogonal set of p orbitals allows the reaction to proceed via a crossed transition state. Cycloadditions in which 4n π electrons participate can also occur via photochemical activation. Here, one component has an electron promoted from the HOMO (π bonding) to the LUMO (π* antibonding). Orbital symmetry is then such that the reaction can proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. An example is the DeMayo reaction. Another example is shown below, the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid.The two ""trans"" alkenes react head-to-tail, and the isolated isomers are called ""truxillic acids"". Supramolecular effects can influence these cycloadditions. The cycloaddition of ""trans""-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene is directed by resorcinol in the solid-state in 100% yield. Some cycloadditions instead of π bonds operate through strained cyclopropane rings; as these have significant π character. For example, an analog for the Diels-Alder reaction is the quadricyclane-DMAD reaction:  In the (i+j+...) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition. In this notation a Diels-Alder reaction is a (4+2)cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is a (3+2)cycloaddition. The IUPAC preferred notation however, with takes electrons into account and not atoms. In this notation the DA reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a [4+2cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a [2+2+2]cycloaddition. Types of cycloaddition. Diels-Alder reactions. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2]cycloaddition reaction. Huisgen cycloadditions. The Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a [2+3]cycloaddition. Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition. The Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition is a [3+2]cycloaddition. Formal cycloadditions. Cycloadditions often have metal-catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs, however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions. When in a cycloaddition charged or radical intermediates are involved or when the cycloaddition result is obtained in a series of reaction steps they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make the distinction with true pericyclic cycloadditions.  One example of a formal [3+3]cycloaddition between a cyclic enone and an enamine catalyzed by ""n""-butyllithium is a Stork enamine / 1,2-addition cascade reaction: "
wikipedia-1256646," Lion Air  PT Lion Mentari Airlines, operating as Lion Air, is Indonesia’s largest privately run airline, capturing the largest share of the domestic market. Headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, Lion Air flies to cities within Indonesia and to Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia and some charter routes to China Mainland and Hong Kong. Its main base is Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta. It operates scheduled passenger services on an extensive network from Jakarta to 79 Destinations. Lion Air has been rapidly expanding its fleet to meet the need for medium-haul jets in the world's fourth most populous country. On March 2013 Lion Air & Airbus signed a $24-billion contract - recorded as the most valuable commercial order booked in history - for 234 A320s. The second biggest was also made by Lion Air in 2011, in a $22.4-billion order for 230 Boeing jets. History. The airline was established in October 1999 and started operations on June 30, 2000, when it began scheduled passenger services between Jakarta and Pontianak using a leased Boeing 737-200. It is owned by Rusdi Kirana and family. The airline is planning to join IATA and therefore hoping to become the second IATA Indonesian member carrier after Garuda Indonesia. Lion Air failed, in early 2011, the initial IATA assessments for membership due to safety concerns. Lion Air and Boeing are pioneering the use of required navigation performance (RNP) procedures in Indonesia, having successfully performed validation flights at the two terrain-challenged airports of Ambon and Manado. Starting February 2010, Lion Air increased the number of flights to Jeddah to five times weekly. This route is being served by two Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which are fitted with 496 seats each. From 19 July 2011, Lion Air has grounded 13 planes due to sanction caused by bad on-time performance (OTP) until Lion Air can fulfill at least 80 percent of OTP. The transportation ministry recorded that Lion Air's OTP of 66.45 percent was the worst of six airlines in an assessment conducted from January to April 2011 at 24 airports nationwide. On the other hand, airlines using Jakarta airport face considerable delays to their schedules due to runway congestion. On 18 November 2011, the airline jointly announced with Boeing for a record-setting order of 201 Boeing 737 MAX and 29 Boeing 737-900ER planes, setting the record for the world's biggest single order of 230 planes for a commercial airline worth $21.7 billion. In January 2012, the Transportation Ministry said that it sanctioned Lion Air because some of its pilots and crew members were found in recent months to be in possession of crystal methamphetamine. In late 2011 Muhammad Nasri and two other co-pilots were arrested at a party in Tangerang; in early 2012 a pilot was caught with crystal meth in Makassar. On 4 February 2012, another Lion Air pilot was arrested following a positive urinalysis test for use of methamphetamine; he was scheduled to fly on Surabaya-Makassar-Balikpapan-Surabaya flight hours later. The licenses of the pilots and crew have been revoked. Lion Air has a drug test program, in which the company's pilots, maintenance and engineering personnel, flight attendants and flight despatchers are required to undergo random drug tests. These tests can occur at anytime. Lion also cooperates with Indonesia's National Narcotics Board, and Lion has an ongoing internal advertising and PR campaign, ""Say No To Drugs"". Lion Air has launched a full-service airline called Batik Air, which began operations in May 2013 using 737-900ERs. Lion Air also signed a commitment with Boeing to order five 787 Dreamliners, making it the first Indonesian airline to order the type since Garuda Indonesia cancelled its firm orders for 10 Dreamliners in 2010; it hopes to have them delivered by 2015. The airline had been considering ordering the competing Airbus A330 widebody but opted to purchase the 787. On 11 September 2012, Lion Air and National Aerospace & Defence Industries Sdn Bhd (Nadi) signed a joint-venture agreement to set up a new airline in Malaysia, to be called Malindo Airways by May 2013. The two partners agreed to form another joint venture to provide maintenance services to all aircraft in the Lion Air Group, including any joint-venture airlines. Destinations. Lion Air serves 60 destinations, 55 domestic and 4 international (as of December 2012). Fleet. Current fleet. As of December 2012, the Lion Air fleet consists of the following aircraft with an average age of 5 years: Orders. Lion Air was the launch customer for the largest variant of the Boeing 737, the 737-900ER, which it placed an order for in 2005. On 26 May 2005, Lion Air signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing for the purchase of up to 60 Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, valued at $3.9 billion at list prices. Lion Air confirmed their order in July 2005 and became the launch customer for the Boeing 737-900ER with firm orders for 30 aircraft and options for 30 more, which were later converted into firm orders. The -900ER can carry up to 215 passengers in a single-class layout, and is powered by CFM56-7B turbofan engines. On 27 April 2007, Boeing delivered the first 737-900ER to Lion Air. The aircraft was delivered in a special dual-paint scheme that combines Lion Air's logo on its vertical stabilizer and the Boeing ""Dreamliner"" livery on the fuselage. Lion Air set a record when it placed an order for 230 aircraft from Boeing, making this the largest order in terms of aircraft ordered as well the cost of the order. In November 2011, Lion Air and Boeing announced that the airline planned to buy 29 737-900ER and 201 737 MAX aircraft, with options for 150 more, valued at $21.7 billion at the time. A firm order was signed on 14 February 2012, with the 737 MAX aircraft identified as 737 MAX 9s, making Lion Air the launch customer for that variant. By the time of the signing, the order's value had risen to $22.4 billion at list prices, the largest aircraft order in history. Additionally, the engines for the -900ERs, CFM 56-7s, cost about $580 million and the engines for the MAXs, CFM LEAP-1Bs, cost about $4.8 billion. Deliveries of the -900ERs are to start in 2016, with the MAXs to follow in 2017. On Monday 18 March 2013 Lion Air placed an order for 234 A320 jets with Airbus, the largest single order ever made surpassing previous record by Boeing ($22.4 Billion). The contract, which was signed at the Elysée Palace in the presence of President François Hollande and several government ministers, is worth €18.4 billion ($24 billion) at catalogue prices, the French presidency said. EU aviation blacklist. Lion Air is one of several Indonesian carriers currently banned from operating in European airspace, because the European Commission has concerns about the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) ability to provide proper regulatory oversight of the Indonesian airline industry. Private jet business. In early 2012, the Transportation Ministry said that the airline was processing an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) for their private business jets. Private-jet services will be launched in the third quarter of 2012 with 4 of nine-seater jets Hawker 900 XP. The aim is to serve clients from the country's mining industry and will compete with Susi Air and Royal Jet. "
wikipedia-1256648," Sigmatropic reaction  A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction wherein the net result is one σ-bond is changed to another σ-bond in an uncatalyzed intramolecular process. The name ""sigmatropic"" is the result of a compounding of the long-established sigma designation from single carbon–carbon bonds and the Greek word ""tropos"", meaning turn. In this type of rearrangement reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system. True sigmatropic reactions are usually uncatalyzed, although Lewis acid catalysis is possible. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [3,3] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis. Overview of sigmatropic shifts. Woodward–Hoffman sigmatropic shift nomenclature. Sigmatropic rearrangements are concisely described by an order term which is defined as the migration of a σ-bond adjacent to one or more π systems to a new position (i−1) and (j−1) atoms removed from the original location of the σ-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain. An odd number is an indication of the involvement of a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a CC double bond. Thus, [1,5 and shifts become [1,4 and [2,3] shifts with heteroatoms, while preserving symmetry considerations. Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity.  A convenient means of determining the order of a given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor. In the case of hydrogen atom migrations, a similar technique may be applied. When determining the order of a sigmatropic shift involving a hydrogen atom migration it is critical to count across all atoms involved in the reaction rather than only across the closest atoms. For example, the following hydrogen atom migration is of order attained by counting counterclockwise through the π system, rather than the [1,3 order designation through the ring CH2 group that would mistakenly result if counted clockwise. Suprafacial and antarafacial shifts. In principle, all sigmatropic shifts can occur with either a retention or inversion of the geometry of the migrating group, depending upon whether the original bonding lobe of the migrating atom or its other lobe is used to form the new bond. In cases of stereochemical retention, the migrating group translates without rotation into the bonding position, while in the case of stereochemical inversion the migrating group both rotates and translates to reach its bonded conformation. However, another stereochemical transition effect equally capable of producing inversion or retention products is whether the migrating group remains on the original face of the π system after rebonding or instead transfers to the opposite face of the π system. If the migrating group remains on the same face of the π system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.  Classes of sigmatropic rearrangements. [1,3] Shifts. Thermal hydride shifts. In a thermal [1,3] hydride shift, a hydride moves three atoms. The Woodward–Hoffmann rules dictate that it would proceed in an antarafacial shift. Although such a shift is symmetry allowed, the Mobius topology required in the transition state prohibits such a shift because it is geometrically impossible, which accounts for the fact that enols do not isomerize without an acid or base catalyst. Thermal alkyl shifts. Thermal alkyl shifts, similar to [1,3 hydride shifts, must proceed antarafacially. Here the geometry of the transition state is prohibitive, but an alkyl group, due to the nature of its orbitals, can invert its geometry, form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital, and therefore proceed via a suprafacial shift. These reactions are still not common in open chain systems because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state, which is more readily achieved in cyclic molecules. Photochemical [1,3] shifts. Photochemical [1,3] shifts should proceed through suprafacial shifts; however, most are non-concerted because they proceed through a triplet state (i.e., have a diradical mechanism, to which the Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not apply). [1,5] Shifts. A [1,5] shift involves the shift of 1 substituent (–H, –R or –Ar) down 5 atoms of a π system. Hydrogen has been shown to shift in both cyclic and open chain systems at temperatures at or above 200 ˚C. These reactions are predicted to proceed suprafacially, via a Huckel-topology transition state.  Photoirradiation would require an antarafacial shift of hydrogen. Although rare, there are examples where antarafacial shifts are favored: In contrast to hydrogen shifts, there have never been any observed [1,5 alkyl shifts in an open-chain system. Several studies have, however, been done to determine rate preferences for [1,5] alkyl shifts in cyclic systems: carbonyl and carboxyl> hydride> phenyl and vinyl» alkyl.  Alkyl groups undergo shifts very poorly, usually requiring high temperatures, however, for cyclohexadienes, the temperature for alkyl shifts isn’t much higher than that for carbonyls, the best migratory group. A study showed that this is because alkyl shifts on cyclohexadienes proceed through a different mechanism. First the ring opens, followed by a [1,7 shift, and then the ring reforms electrocyclically: This same mechanistic process is seen below, without the final electrocyclic ring-closing reaction, in the interconversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2. [1,7] Shifts. sigmatropic shifts are predicted by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules to proceed in an antarafacial fashion, via a Mobius topology transition state. An antarafacial [1,7 shift is observed in the conversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2, where following an electrocyclic ring opening to previtamin D2, a methyl hydrogen shifts.  Bicyclic nonatrienes also undergo [1,7] shifts in a so-called walk rearrangement, which is the shift of divalent group, as part of a three-membered ring, in a bicyclic molecule. [3,3] Shifts. [3,3] sigmatropic shifts are well studied sigmatropic rearrangements. The Woodward–Hoffman rules predict that these six electron reactions would proceed suprafacially, via a Huckel topology transition state. Claisen rearrangement. Main article: Claisen rearrangement Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a rearrangement. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. An example of Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3 rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which upon heating yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl. The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction, unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements, inherently irreversible.  Aromatic Claisen rearrangement. The ortho-Claisen rearrangement involves the [3,3] shift of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol. When both the ortho positions on the benzene ring are blocked, a second ortho-Claisen rearrangement will occur. This para-Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri-substituted phenol. Cope rearrangement. Main article: Cope rearrangement The Cope rearrangement is an extensively studied organic reaction involving the [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It was developed by Arthur C. Cope. For example 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene heated to 300 °C yields 2,6-octadiene. Oxy-Cope rearrangement. The Oxy-Cope rearrangement a hydroxyl group is added at C3 forming an enal or enone after Keto-enol tautomerism of the intermediate enol: Carroll rearrangement. The Carroll rearrangement is a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry and involves the transformation of a β-keto allyl ester into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation. Fischer indole synthesis. Main article: Fischer indole synthesis The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.  The choice of acid catalyst is very important. Bronsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid have been used successfully. Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts. Several reviews have been published. [5,5] Shifts. Similar to shifts, the Woodward-Hoffman rules predict that [5,5 sigmatropic shifts would proceed suprafacially, Huckel topology transition state. These reactions are rarer than sigmatropic shifts, but this is mainly a function of the fact that molecules that can undergo [5,5 shifts are rarer than molecules that can undergo [3,3] shifts. [2,3] shifts. An example of an 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement is the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement: Walk rearrangements. The migration of a divalent group, such as O, S, N R or C R2, which is part of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycle(norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [1,5 alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening.  Proceeding through a shift, the walk rearrangement of norcaradienes is expected to proceed suprafacially with a retention of stereochemistry. Experimental observations, however, show that the 1,5-shifts of norcaradienes proceed antarafacially. Theoretical calculations found the [1,5 shift to be a diradical process, but without involving any diradical minima on the potential energy surface. "
wikipedia-1256678," Prime Minister of Ukraine  The Prime Minister of Ukraine () is Ukraine's head of government presiding over the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, which is the highest body of the executive branch of the Ukrainian government. The position replaced Soviet post of the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR that existed since March 25, 1946. In the absence of the President of Ukraine assumes the role of the country's acting President (Article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Since Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been 15 Prime Ministers (19 counting acting PMs). Mykola Azarov is the incumbent Prime Minister as of March 11, 2010. Appointment and dismissal. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President with the consent of Verkhovna Rada. The consent is deemed granted by the parliament when a simple majority of its constitutional membership votes in favour of the candidate nominated by the President. The highest parliamentary approval to this date was received by Yulia Tymoshenko who was appointed the Prime Minister on February 4, 2005 with 373 votes in the Verkhovna Rada. Other prime ministers who received more than 300 votes were Vitold Fokin (332) and Leonid Kuchma (316). The procedure of granting consent by the parliament is usually preceded by several days of comprehensive consultations and interviews of the candidate by the parliamentary factions. The approval by the legislature is not a mere formality. Some candidates were ratified by a narrow margin and a candidate may be turned down. For instance, in 1999, Valeriy Pustovoitenko fell short of 3 votes to be re-confirmed after he tendered his resignation at the second inauguration of President Leonid Kuchma in 1999. Kuchma chose Viktor Yushchenko as his alternative candidate. Another example is the approval of Yuriy Yekhanurov candidacy (he fell short of 3 votes to get approved and was confirmed on the second attempt 2 days later). When the constitutional reform of late 2004 was still valid (on October 1, 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 amendments, considering the procedure of their approval unconstitutional), the President was restricted in his choice of the Prime Minister candidacy and was virtually obliged to nominate the person proposed by the parliamentary coalition. The President may also dismiss any government minister or deputy minister (including the Prime-minister) at any time. At times when the Prime Minister is absent the Cabinet is presided by the First Deputy Prime Minister as an acting Prime Minister. Prime Minister, as any members of executive branch, can not be a Member of Parliament. Duties and powers. The Prime Minister heads Ukraine's executive branch of government, the Cabinet of Ministers and signs decrees passed by the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has the authority to announce their candidacies to the Verkhovna Rada for ministry offices (with the exception of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense which are proposed by the President). The Prime Minister can also propose candidacies of heads of regional administrations to the President for consideration. The Prime Minister can also countersign decrees and laws passed by the President. The constitution is silent on the exact regulation of the countersigning. The Prime Minister (and the respective minister) are responsible for the execution of laws passed by the Cabinet. While in office, the Prime Minister is granted full legal immunity from all prosecutions and legal proceedings. The Prime Minister's office is headquartered in the Cabinet of Ministries building in central Kiev. The Prime Minister was paid a yearly salary of 202,776 UAH (16,898/month) (US$26,770) in 2005. In 2013 on a petition of the ""Fokus"" magazine the secretariat of Cabinet of Ukraine informed that the monthly salary of Prime Minister accounts for 33,980 UAH (US$4,173.42) which 11 times more than an average salary in the country. On May 13, 2010 Prime Minister Mykola Azarov claimed that ninety percent of decisions taken by the second Tymoshenko Government had not been implemented. Ukrainian Prime Minister are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems (sometimes successful); in 2012 Prime Minister Azarov received dozens of personal pleas every day on his Facebook page. By-passing local Governments is an ages old practice in Ukraine. Vice-Prime Ministers. The Prime Minister has his ""First Vice-Prime Minister"" or for brevity the First Deputy who heads the cabinet in the absence of the Prime Minister (resignation, dismissal, etc.). Among the most notable First deputies were Yukhym Zvyahilsky and Mykola Azarov who served as the acting Prime minister longer for anyone. Beside them the position of the ""acting"" also served Valentyn Symonenko, Vasyl Durdynets, Oleksandr Turchynov and others. Aside of the First Vice-Prime Minister there are also several Vice-Ministers who support the Prime Minister and may be in charge of a ministry or a combination of several. In 1991–1992 there also was introduced an office of the State Minister-Minister. Traditionally Vice-Prime Ministers are in charge of a general state government policy vectors such as the Agro-Industrial Complex, Humanitarian Affairs, Economical Affairs, Regional Policy, others. On certain occasions those deputies may be given regular ministerial portfolios as well, similar to the 2010 Azarov Government. Dismissal and resignation. The Prime Minister, as well as any other Cabinet member, may resign voluntarily by tendering their resignation to the President. A resignation by the Prime Minister results in the dismissal of the entire Cabinet. After the adoption of the current Constitution (1996), only Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko lost his post this way. Before the constitutional reform of 2004, the Prime Minister was usually dismissed unilaterally by the President. After the reform, the Prime Minister could only be dismissed by the parliament. Formally, the Verkhovna Rada needed to pass a resolution of no confidence in the Cabinet, which had to result in the PM's resignation. However, the parliament could not put the resolution on vote within one year after the approval of the Cabinet's official programme. The Cabinets of Prime Ministers Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were dismissed this way with the latter refusing to tender his resignation to the President claiming a violation of the one-year period condition. The Cabinet of Yuriy Yekhanurov had also been formally dismissed, but the parliamentary act was subsequently repealed. After the annulment of the constitutional reform the President once again has the right to dismiss the Prime Minister at any time at his or her own discretion, while the parliament still retains the right to pass a censure motion against the Cabinet which leads to obligatory resignation of the Cabinet. With each new presidential term, the Prime Minister (and the Cabinet) are obliged to resign. While the Prime Minister does not have a set term limit, he or she stays in office for the duration of the President's term (unless he or she resigns or is dismissed earlier). Prime Ministers of Ukraine (1991 – present). Since Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been 15 Prime Ministers (19 including acting PMs). Yulia Tymoshenko was the first (and only) female Prime Minister in Ukraine. Before the re-appointed as Prime Minister of Mykola Azarov the length of holding the post of Prime Minister was held by Tymoshenko, she served two terms for the total of 1,029 days (days of serving as acting Prime Minister are not included in these numbers). Since incumbent Azarov was re-appointed as Prime Minister on 13 December 2012 he since then broke Tymoshenko's record. "
wikipedia-1256680," CO₂ retention  CO2 retention is a pathophysiological process in which too little carbon dioxide is removed from the blood by the lungs. The end result is hypercapnia, an elevated level of carbon dioxide dissolved in the bloodstream. Various diseases may lead to this state; disturbed gas exchange may lead to impaired excretion of the gas. In addition, breathing air with a high carbon dioxide concentration may also lead to hypercapnia. The principal result of the increased amount of dissolved CO2 is acidosis (respiratory acidosis when caused by impaired lung function); other effects include tachycardia (rapid heart rate) seizures, coma, respiratory arrest and death. CO2 retention is a problem in various respiratory diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD who receive excessive supplemental oxygen can develop CO2 retention, and subsequent hypercapnia. The mechanism that underlies this state is a matter of controversy. Some authorities point to a reduction in the hypoxic ""drive"", a condition called carbon dioxide narcosis. When carbon dioxide levels are chronically elevated, the respiratory center becomes less sensitive to as a stimulant of the respiratory drive, and the PaO2 provides the primary stimulus for respirations. Administering excess supplemental oxygen can potentially suppress the respiratory center. However, it is unclear whether such a hypoxic drive exists in the first place. An alternative explanation is that, in patients with COPD, the administration of oxygen leads to an increase in the degree to which diseased alveoli are perfused with blood relative to other, less-diseased alveoli. As a result, a larger fraction of blood passes through parts of the lung that are poorly-ventilated, with a resulting increase in the CO2 concentration of the blood leaving the lungs. As CO2 levels increase, patients exhibit a reduction in overall level of consciousness as well as respiratory effort. Severe increases in CO2 levels can lead to respiratory arrest. CO2 retention is the hallmark of type II respiratory failure. While in type I any degree of hypoxia is compensated for by hyperventilation (and a decrease in CO2), this mechanism fails in type II. Mechanical ventilation (through intubation), CPAP or BIPAP may be indicated, or infusion of doxapram. In diving. CO2 retention with its attendant dangers of death from convulsions and hypoxia (low oxygen level) is primarily of concern to the scuba diver due to ""skip breathing"". Other mechanisms of CO2 retention are breath-hold diving, breathing in a sealed environment, faulty regulator, exercise at extreme depth and using contaminated air. Symptoms include rapid respiration in 4-6%, rapid pulse rate, shortness of breath in 7-10% and convulsions and unconsciousness in 11-20%. The CO2 level in the blood is unchanged by the ambient pressure (i.e., the depth) per se, since the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a scuba diver's blood is a function only of metabolism and the rate and depth of breathing—the same factors that determine blood CO2 concentration on land. All of the CO2 developed during breathing from open circuit equipment underwater is normally expelled from the apparatus in the exhaled breath as bubbles. The partial pressure of CO2 produced by the body does not increase with depth as do other gases in breathing mixes, such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Abnormal carbon dioxide accumulation in the blood can occur from too high a level of metabolism, such as from exercise at depth, or from inadequate breathing. If the diver takes shallow breaths or skip breathes, a larger proportion of the CO2 is not completely expelled and is re-inhaled on the next breath. The medical term for high carbon dioxide in the blood is hypercapnia; when the level is high enough it can cause ""CO2 toxicity,"" which can lead to shortness of breath, headache, confusion and drowning (depending on how severe). Elevated CO2 levels play a significant role in oxygen toxicity and in nitrogen narcosis. The acceptable CO2 level for diving operations is 1.5% surface equivalent (10.5 mmHg); the acceptable level for hyperbaric oxygen therapy operations is one that allows a vent schedule of 4 scfm per person displacement. Closed circuit equipment. With the increased usage of rebreather diving, mainly by the military—but recently by more and more civilian divers, there is the possibility of hypercapnia (high CO2 levels), among other medical considerations. Signs and symptoms that need to be observed are hyperventilation, shortness of breath and tachycardia (rapid heart beat), headache and excessive sweating, mental impairment and finally, unconsciousness. This hypercapnia comes about due to malfunction of the soda lime CO2 absorbent canisters and can be avoided by decreasing the exercise rate, watching out for the operating limits of the canister, checking for leaks at the start of the dive, ensuring that the absorbent is well packed with no possibility of tunneling (formation of clear passages through the absorbent allowing gas to bypass the reactive material) and not reusing the absorbent. "
wikipedia-1256692," Adriana Lecouvreur  Adriana Lecouvreur is an opera in four acts by Francesco Cilea to an Italian libretto by Arturo Colautti, based on the 1849 play ""Adrienne Lecouvreur"" by Eugène Scribe and Ernest Legouvé. It was first performed on 6 November 1902 in Milan. Background. The same play by Scribe and Legouvé which served as a basis for Cilea's librettists was also used by at least three different librettists for operas carrying exactly the same name, ""Adriana Lecouvreur"", and created by three different composers. The first was an opera in three acts by Tommaso Benvenuti (premiered in Milan in 1857). The next two were lyric dramas in 4 acts by Edoardo Vera (to a libretto by Achille de Lauzières) which premiered in Lisbon in 1858, and by Ettore Perosio (to an anonymous libretto), premiered in Geneva in 1889. After Cilea created his own ""Adriana"", however, none of those by others were performed anymore and they remain largely unknown today. The opera is based on the life of the French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur (1692–1730). While there are some actual historical figures in the opera, the episode it recounts is largely fictional, its death-by-poisoned violets plot device often signalled as verismo opera's least realistic. It is often condemned as being among the most confusing texts ever written for the stage, and cuts that have often been made in performance only make the story harder to follow. The running time of a typical modern performance is about 135 minutes (excluding intervals). Performance history. The opera premiered at the Teatro Lirico, Milan, on 6 November 1902, with the well-known verismo soprano Angelica Pandolfini in the title role, Enrico Caruso in the role of Maurizio, and the lyric baritone Giuseppe De Luca as Michonnet.  The opera was first performed in the United States by the San Carlo Opera Company on January 5, 1907 at the French Opera House in New Orleans with Tarquinia Tarquini in the title role. It gained its Metropolitan Opera premiere on 18 November 1907 (in a performance starring Lina Cavalieri and Caruso). It had a run of only three performances that season, however, due in large part to Caruso's ill-health. Subsequently, it was revived at the Met from time until a new production was commissioned in 1963. That 1963 production continued to be remounted at the same theatre, with differing casts, for the next few decades. It was in the lead role of this opera that the Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo made his Met debut in 1968, alongside Renata Tebaldi in the title role. He sang again in ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" in February 2009, although his voice was by then in decline.  The title role in ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" has always been a favorite of sopranos with large voices, which tend to sit less at the very top of their range. This part has a relatively low tessitura but requires great vocal power, and is a meaty and challenging one to tackle on a dramatic level – especially during the work's so-called ""Recitation"" and death scene. Famous Adrianas of the past 75 years have included Claudia Muzio, Magda Olivero, Leyla Gencer, Montserrat Caballé, Renata Tebaldi, Raina Kabaivanska, Renata Scotto, Mirella Freni and Joan Sutherland. Angela Gheorghiu tackled the role at the Royal Opera, London in 2010 with Jonas Kaufmann as Maurizio.."" A recording of part of the opera's last act duet ""No, più nobile"", rejigged into a self-contained tenor aria, was made by Caruso as early as 1902 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company in Milan and its affiliates, with Cilea at the piano.  In Decca's 1990 complete performance of the work, with Dame Joan Sutherland as the female lead, the Australian conductor Richard Bonynge made sure that he restored a long-lost passage that Cilea had cut originally from the score. Its restoration made the opera's plot more transparent. Synopsis. Act 1. ""Backstage at the Comédie-Française"" Preparing for a performance, the company bustle around Michonnet, the stage manager. The Prince de Bouillon, admirer of the actress Duclos, is with his companion, the Abbé. Adriana enters reciting. Complimented, she sings 'Io son l'umile ancella' (""I am the humble servant of the creative spirit""). The Prince hears that Duclos is writing a letter, and arranges for its interception. Left alone with Adriana, Michonnet wants to express his love for her, but Adriana explains she has a lover – a soldier in the service of the Count of Saxony. Maurizio is in reality the count himself. He enters and declares his love for Adriana, 'La dolcissima effigie'. They will meet after the performance. Adriana gives him some violets to put in his buttonhole. The Prince and the Abbé return. They have obtained the letter from Duclos – asking for a meeting with Maurizio later that evening near the Prince's villa. The Prince decides to arrange a party for the company at the villa in order to expose the couple. He sends the letter on to Maurizio who then cancels his appointment with Adriana. She receives his letter on stage. Adriana agrees to join the Prince's party. Act 2. ""A villa by the Seine"" The Princess de Bouillon, not the actress Duclos, is waiting for Maurizio. She loves him, 'Acerba voluttà, dolce tortura'. He enters. She sees the violets, and asks where he got them. He presents them to her. Maurizio is grateful for her help at court but admits he no longer loves her. She guesses that he has a lover but he won't reveal who she is. The Prince and the Abbé suddenly arrive and the Princess hides. Maurizio realizes they think he is with Duclos. Adriana enters and learns Maurizio's true identity. He tells Adriana the assignation was political. They must arrange the escape of a woman who is in hiding. She is not Duclos. Adriana trusts him and agrees to help. During the intermezzo that follows the house is darkened, and Adriana tells the Princess she can escape. However, the two women are mutually suspicious and the rescue attempt turns into a blazing quarrel before the Princess finally leaves. Michonnet notices a bracelet dropped by the Princess. He gives it to Adriana. Act 3. ""The Hôtel de Bouillon"" Maurizio has been imprisoned for debt, and the Princess is desperate to discover the identity of her rival. The Prince, who has an interest in chemistry, is putting away a powerful poison that the government has asked him to analyze. Michonnet and Adriana arrive for the reception. The Princess thinks she recognizes her voice. She announces that Maurizio has been wounded in a duel and Adriana faints. Soon afterwards Maurizio enters uninjured and Adriana is ecstatic. He sings of his war exploits, 'Il russo Mencikoff'. A ballet is performed: the 'Judgement of Paris'. The Princess and Adriana challenge each other in growing recognition that they are rivals for Maurizio's affection. Adriana learns that the bracelet Michonnet found belongs to the Princess. The latter pointedly suggests that Adriana should recite a scene from 'Ariadne abandoned' but the Prince asks instead for a scene from ""Phèdre"". Adriana uses the final lines of the text to make a headstrong attack on the Princess, who determines to have her revenge. Act 4. ""A room in Adriana's house"" Michonnet is waiting. Adriana is delirious with anger and jealousy. Members of the theatre company come to visit her, bringing her presents on her name day, trying to persuade her to return to the theatre. Michonnet has retrieved a diamond necklace, previously pawned by Adriana to help Maurizio pay off his debts. A casket is delivered with a note from Maurizio. Adriana looks at the note and immediately feels unwell. She looks in the box and takes out the faded violets that she had once given Maurizio in the theatre. She is hurt that he should send them back to her. She kisses the flowers, 'Poveri fiori', and throws them in the fire. Maurizio enters. He wishes to marry her. They embrace, but he finds she is shaking. Maurizio tells her that he didn't send the flowers. She becomes deranged. Michonnet and Maurizio realize that she has been poisoned. She becomes lucid again, 'Ecco la luce', and dies. References. Notes Sources "
wikipedia-1256700," Transleithania  Transleithania (, , ) was an unofficial term for a large part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual monarchy created in 1867 and dissolved in 1918. It comprised the Kingdom of Hungary proper with Transylvania incorporated into it, Croatia-Slavonia, and the city of Fiume. The Transleithanian lands were officially known as the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crown of Hungary. The Latin name ""Transleithania"" referred to the parts of the Empire ""beyond"" (""trans"") the ""Leitha"" (or ""Lajta"") River, as most of its area lay to the east of that river or ""beyond"" it, from an Austrian perspective. Cisleithania, i.e. the Habsburg lands of the Dual Monarchy that formerly were part of the Holy Roman Empire with Galicia and Dalmatia, lay to the weston this sideof the Leitha river. The territory reached from the arc of the Carpathian Mountains in present-day Slovakia to the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea. The capital of Transleithania was Budapest. Extent. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Transleithania consisted of the Kingdom of Hungary (including the former Principality of Transylvania (""Erdélyi Fejedelemség"") as well as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar), the internally self-governed Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia with the Military Frontier, and the free port of Fiume. Politics. The Transleithanian lands were under the rule of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I as Apostolic King of Hungary and King of Croatia and Slavonia. He was succeeded by his grand-nephew Emperor Charles I (King Charles IV) in 1916. On 18 February 1867 the Hungarian Minister-President Count Gyula Andrássy convened the diet. According to the Croatian–Hungarian Agreement of 1868, the ""Sabor"" assembly of the former Kingdom of Croatia gained partial sovereignty to legislate in the areas of justice, education and religious matters, and interior affairs. The existence of Transleithania came to an end, when the Croatian ""Sabor"" assembly at Zagreb decided to join the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 29 October 1918. The diet at Budapest repealed the Austro-Hungarian Compromise as of 31 October 1918, after which the Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed on November 16. King Charles IV however never abdicated and from 1920 until 1944 the restored Kingdom of Hungary was governed by Miklós Horthy as a regent. "
wikipedia-1256704," Christ Church Greyfriars  Christ Church Greyfriars, also known as Christ Church Newgate Street, was a church in Newgate Street, opposite St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. Established as a monastic church in the thirteenth century, it became a parish church after the dissolution of the monastery. Following its destruction in the Great Fire of London of 1666, it was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. Except for the tower, the church was largely destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The ruins are now a public garden. History. Gothic church. Christ Church Greyfriars had its origins in the conventual church of a Franciscan monastery, the name ""Greyfriars"" being a reference to the grey habits worn by Franciscan monks. The first church on the site was built in the thirteenth century, but this was soon replaced by a bigger building, begun in 1306 and consecrated in 1326 This new church was the second largest in medieval London, measuring long and wide, with at least eleven altars. It was built partly at the expense of Marguerite of France, second wife of King Edward I. She was buried at the church, as was Isabella, widow of Edward II. The heart of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III, was also interred there. Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London founded a library in connection with the church in 1429. The monastery was dissolved in 1538 during the English Reformation. The building and fittings suffered heavy damage in this period. Tombs disappeared, sold for their marble and other valuable materials; monuments were defaced. In 1546 Henry VIII gave the priory and its church, along with the churches of St Nicholas Shambles and St Ewin, Newgate Market, to the City Corporation. A new parish of Christ Church was created, incorporating those of St Nicholas and St Ewin, and part of that of St Sepulchre. The priory buildings later housed Christ's Hospital school, founded by Edward VI, and the church became its pupils' principal place of worship. Wren's church. The medieval church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Reconstruction was assigned to Wren, who oversaw a decades long-programme that rebuilt St. Paul's Cathedral and approximately 50 parish churches in the fire zone. There appears to have been some debate about the form the new Christ Church should take. A surviving unused design shows a structure considerably larger than what was eventually built. The parish was united with that of St Leonard, Foster Lane, which was not rebuilt Parishioners raised £1,000 to begin work on the design that in the end was selected. To save time and money, the foundations of the gothic church were partially reused. The new church and tower (without  steeple) were completed in 1687, at a total cost of £11,778 9s. shillings 7¼d. Smaller than the gothic  structure, the building measured long and wide, occupying only the eastern end of the site of the medieval church, the western part becoming its churchyard. The tower, rising from the west end of the church, had a simple round-arched main entranceway and, above, windows decorated with neoclassical pediments. Large carved pineapples, symbols of welcome,  graced the four roof corners of the main church structure. Unique among the Wren churches, the east and west walls had buttresses. The interior was divided into nave and aisles by Corinthian columns, raised on tall plinths so that their bases were level with the gallery floors. The aisles had flat ceilings, while the nave had a shallow cross-vault. The north and south walls had large round-arched windows of clear glass, which allowed for a brightly lit interior. The east end had trinity windows, a large wooden altar screen and a carved hexagonal pulpit, reached by stairs.  There was elaborate carved wainscoting. A pavement of reddish brown and grey marble to the west of the altar rails was said to date from the original gothic church. Galleries stood over the north and south  aisles, built at special request of the officers of Christ's Hospital as seating for the school's students. Pews were said to have been made from the timbers of a wrecked Spanish galleon. The organ, on the west wall over the main nave door, was built by Renatus Harris in 1690, according to a pre-war guide to the church. The steeple, standing about tall, was finished in 1704 at an additional cost of £1,963, 8s. 3½ d. It has three diminishing storeys, square in plan, the middle one with a freestanding Ionic colonnade. Over the course of the church’s existence, significant modifications were made. In 1760, a vestry house was built against the facade’s south side and part of the church's south wall. At some point, rooms were  enclosed in the north and south aisles beneath the galleries. Stained glass depicting Jesus with the children was installed in the centre trinity window to replace the original clear glass. The church functioned as an important centre of City of London society and music. The Lord Mayor attended an annual service to hear the Ancient Spital Sermon on the second Wednesday after Easter, placing his ceremonial sword in a special holder. Felix Mendelssohn played Bach's A minor fugue and other works on the organ in 1837. Samuel Wesley also performed at the church. The Christ's Hospital boys continued to attend services, sitting in the galleries. According to the pre-war guide book to the church, they included the young Samuel Coleridge and Charles Lamb. Sixth Form boys tasked with maintaining order sat in special seats placed over those of the younger students. A few boys carved initials in the woodwork. Decline of the congregation. Around the turn of the 20th century, Christ's Hospital moved out of the City to Horsham, West Sussex, ending the Sunday influx of its schoolboys. A new vicar, T.R. Hine-Haycock, took over in 1912. A July  1922 Christ Church newsletter preserved at Guildhall Library shows that at that time it had an 8:30 a.m. Holy Communion service every Sunday, and musical services at 11 a.m. every first and third Sunday.  The church was open daily for private prayer from noon to 3 p.m. In its final years, the congregation continued to drop in size, a common trend for City churches as people relocated to suburban neighbourhoods of  London. Parish records at the Guildhall Library show there were 112 members in April 1933, mostly residents of places outside the parish boundaries. Many of those who made their homes in the parish were ""housekeepers"", people who lived in and looked after commercial buildings. In April 1937, the membership had dropped to 77. Destruction. The church was severely damaged in the Blitz on 29 December 1940. During one of the Second World War's fiercest air raids on London, a firebomb struck the roof  and tore into the nave. Much of the surrounding neighbourhood was also set alight—a total of eight  Wren churches burned that night. At Christ Church, the only fitting known to have been saved was the cover of the finely carved wooden font, recovered by an unknown postman who ran inside as the flames raged. The roof and vaulting collapsed into the nave; the tower and four main walls, made of stone, remained standing but were smoke-scarred and gravely weakened. A photograph taken the following day shows two firemen hosing down smouldering rubble in the nave. Post-war period. In 1949, in a reorganisation of Church of England parishes in London, authorities decided not to rebuild Christ Church. The remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In 1954, the Christ Church parish was merged with that of the nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.  The steeple, still standing after the wartime damage, was disassembled in 1960 and put back together using modern construction methods. The surviving east wall was demolished in 1962 to make way for a widening of King Edward Street. In 1981, neo-Georgian brick offices were constructed against the southwest corner of the ruins, in imitation of the 1760 vestry house that had stood there. In 1989, the former nave area became a public garden and memorial. The tower functioned as commercial space, although it has now been converted into a private residence. In 2002, the financial firm Merrill Lynch completed a regional headquarters complex on land abutting to the north and the west. In conjunction with that project, the Christ Church site underwent a major renovation and archeological examination, King Edward Street was returned to its former course, and the site of the church regained its pre-war footprint. The churchyard was spruced up and its metal railings restored. In 2006, work was completed to convert the tower and spire into a modern twelve-level private residence. The nave area continues as a memorial; the wooden font cover, topped by a carved angel, can today be seen in the porch of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. "
wikipedia-1256713," Diving medicine  Diving medicine, also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how relationships of a diver's fitness to dive affect a diver's safety. Hyperbaric medicine is a corollary field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving related illnesses, decompression illness and arterial gas embolism. Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and an important part of diver education. Range and scope of diving medicine. The scope of diving medicine must necessarily include conditions that are specifically connected with the activity of diving, and not found in other contexts, but this categorization excludes almost everything, leaving only deep water blackout, isobaric counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. A more useful grouping is conditions that are associated with exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Further conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver, rather than the specialist medical practitioner, as they are useful background to diver first aid training. The scope of knowledge necessary for a practitioner of diving mediciene includes the medical conditions associated with diving and their treatment, physics and physiology relating to the underwater and pressurised environment, the standard operating procedures and equipment used by divers which can influence the development and management of these conditions, and the specialised equipment used for treatment. Scope of knowledge for diving medicine. The ECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2011) specify the following scope of knowledge for Diving Medicine: Scope of knowledge for hyperbaric medicine. The ECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2011) specify the following scope of knowledge for Hyperbaric Medicine additional to that for Ddiving medicine: Diagnostics. The signs and symptoms of diving disorders may present during a dive, on surfacing, or up to several hours after a dive. Divers have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings, which can be much greater than on the surface. The ambient pressure underwater increases by for every of depth. The principal conditions are: decompression illness (which covers decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities. The disorders are caused by breathing gas at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox, which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at recreational depths (up to about ). Helium may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about , because a helium–oxygen mixture (heliox) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox, a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this. Decompression sickness. Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. Pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism. If the breathing gas in a diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, the lungs may be expanded beyon their compliance, and the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The gas may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. Nitrogen narcosis. Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces impairment to the nervous system. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills, and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. High pressure nervous syndrome. Helium is the least narcotic of all gases, and divers may use breathing mixtures containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of . However, it was found that different symptoms, such as tremors, occurred at shallower depths around . This became known as high pressure nervous syndrome, and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for the individual. Oxygen toxicity. Although oxygen is essential to life, in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes toxic, overcoming the body's natural defences (antioxidants), and causing cell death in any part of the body. The lungs and brain are particularly affected by high partial pressures of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around indefinitely, and up to for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of oxygen toxicity, a convulsion resembling an epileptic seizure. Susceptibility to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a smaller extent from day to day for the same diver. Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present – most distinctly that of an aura. Treatments. Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is the definitive treatment for most incidences of decompression illness.. Hyperbaric treatment using other breathing gases is also used for treatment of decompression sickness if HBO is inadequate. Oxygen therapy. The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer term treatment. Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. Now, it is a highly specialized treatment modality that has been found to be effective in the treatment of many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure has been found to be beneficial. Studies have shown it to be quite effective in some 13 indications approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, but in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues in severe cases of decompression illness. Education and registration of practitioners. Specialist training in underwater and hyperbaric medicine is available from several institutions, and registration is possible both with professional associations and governmental registries. Registration. The American Medical Assocition recognises the sub-speciality ""Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine"" held by someone who is already Board Certified in some other speciality. The South African Department of Labour registers two levels of ""Diving Medical Practitioner"". Level 1 is qualified to conduct annual examinations and certification of medical fitness to dive, on commercial divers (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 1. Medical Examiner of Divers), and Level 2 is qualified to provide medical advice to a diving contractor and hyperbaric treatment for diving injuries (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 2D Diving Medicine Physician) Australia has a four tier system: In 2007 there was no recognised equivalence with the European standard. Training of divers and support staff in relevant first aid. Divers. A basic knowledge understanding of the causes, symptoms and first aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers, both to help the diver avoid the disorders, and to allow appropriate action in case of an incident resulting in injury. Recreational divers. A recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public, and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid or other medical skills. Nevertheless, first aid is training is recommended by most, if not all, recreational diver training agencies. Recreational diving instructors and divemasters, on the other hand, are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant training standards of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Oxygen administration for diving accidents. Professional divers. Professional divers usually operate as members of a team with a duty of care for other members of the team. Divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in fescuoe procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice.  Diving supervisors have a similar duty of care, and as they are responsible for operational planning and safety, generally are also expected to mange emergency procedures, including the first aid that may be required. The level of first ait training, competence and certification will generally take this into account. Diver Medic. A diver medic is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid. A Diver Medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering First Aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a doctor pending the arrival of more skilled medical aid, and therefore must be able to effectively communicate with a doctor who is not on site, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The Diver Medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures provide advice as to when more specialised medical help should be requested, and must be fit to provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency, and must therefore hold a valid certificate of medical fitness to dive. Training standards for Diver Medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training. "
wikipedia-1256736," Rural municipality  A rural municipality, often abbreviated RM, is a form of municipality in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, perhaps best comparable to counties or townships in the western United States. Unlike most counties in the United States or Canada, rural municipalities specifically exclude designated official cities, towns, villages, and First Nations Indian reserves from their territory. They are essentially the rural portion of what would normally be a county. In this way, they could perhaps best be compared to certain counties in the state of Virginia that have independent cities excluded from their territory, although, in Virginia there is usually only one independent city per county, whereas there can be many officially excluded communities in the geographical territory of rural municipalities. History. The Municipal Ordinance of 1883 was enacted by the North-West Territories to provide services to a rural area and provide some means of municipal governing. Saskatchewan and Alberta became provinces in 1905.  North West Territorial Government issues Statute Labour Ordinance (1897) and sets of Fire Districts, Statute Labour and Fire (SLF) Districts or Statute Labour Districts. Community residents could pay taxes or supply a couple days per quarter section labour constructing roads, bridges, fireguards instead of paying taxes. The prairie fire in the 19th century were devastating affairs. Fire districts were later called Local Improvement Districts which themselves were reformed into Rural Municipalities.  In Saskatchewan, Local Improvement Districts (1898), typically called LID, were the precursors of Rural Municipalities. December 13, 1909 saw the beginning of the discontinuance of Local improvement districts in favour of smaller rural municipal areas. Typically, an RM consists of about nine townships, each 6 miles by six miles in area. Settled areas of denser populations could form urban municipalities with as village, town or city governance. Above the tree line in northern Saskatchewan the large Northern Local Improvement District was replaced by the Department of Northern Saskatchewan in 1972 and was not subdivided into smaller Rural Municipalities. Old Post, Saskatchewan is the largest Rural Municipality and it was formed from the last Local Improvement District.  Alberta had numerical Improvement Districts which became Municipal Districts. "
wikipedia-1256768," Ene reaction  The ene reaction (also known as the Alder-ene reaction) is a chemical reaction between an alkene with an allylic hydrogen (the ene) and a compound containing a multiple bond (the enophile), in order to form a new σ-bond with migration of the ene double bond and 1,5 hydrogen shift. The product is a substituted alkene with the double bond shifted to the allylic position. This transformation is a group transfer pericyclic reaction, and therefore, usually requires highly activated substrates and/or high temperatures. Nonetheless, the reaction is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups that can be appended to the ene and enophile moieties. Also,many useful Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions have been developed which can afford high yields and selectivities at significantly lower temperatures, making the ene reaction a useful C–C forming tool for the synthesis of complex molecules and natural products. Ene component. Enes are π-bonded molecules that contain at least one active hydrogen atom at the allylic, propargylic, or α-position. Possible ene components include olefinic, acetylenic, allenic, aromatic, cyclopropyl, and carbon-hetero bonds. Usually, the allylic hydrogen of allenic components participates in ene reactions, but in the case of allenyl silanes, the allenic hydrogen atom α to the silicon substituent is the one transferred, affording a silylalkyne. Phenol can act as an ene component, for example in the reaction with dihydropyran, but high temperatures are required (150–170°C). Nonetheless, strained enes and fused small ring systems undergo ene reactions at much lower temperatures. In addition, ene components containing C=O, C=N and C=S bonds have been reported, but such cases are rare. Enophile. Enophiles are π-bonded molecules which have electron-withdrawing substituents that lower significantly the LUMO of the π-bond. Possible enophiles contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, acetylenes, benzynes), carbon-hetero multiple bonds (C=O in the case of carbonyl-ene reactions, C=N, C=S, C≡P), hetero-hetero multiple bonds (N=N, O=O, Si=Si, N=O, S=O), cumulene systems (N=S=O, N=S=N, C=C=O, C=C=S, SO2) and charged π systems (C=N+, C=S+, C≡O+, C≡N+). Mechanism. Concerted pathway and transition states. The main frontier-orbital interaction occurring in an ene reaction is between the HOMO of the ene and the LUMO of the enophile (Figure 2). The HOMO of the ene results from the combination of the pi-bonding orbital in the vinyl moiety and the C-H bonding orbital for the allylic H. Concerted, all-carbon-ene reactions have, in general, a high activation barrier, which was approximated at 33 kcal/mol in the case of propene and ethene, as computed at the M06-2X/def2-TZVPP level of theory. However, if the enophile becomes more polar (going from ethane to formaldehyde), its LUMO has a larger amplitude on C, yielding a better C–C overlap and a worse H–O one, determining the reaction to proceed in an asynchronous fashion. This translates into a lowering of the activation barrier until 14.7 kcal/mol (M06-2X/def2-TZVPP), if S replaces O on the enophile. By computationally examining both the activation barriers and the activation strains of several different ene reactions involving propene as the ene component, Fernandez and co-workers have found that the barrier decreases along the enophiles in the order H2C=CH2 > H2C=NH > H2C=CH(COOCH3) > H2C=O > H2C=PH > H2C=S, as the reaction becomes more and more asynchronous and/or the activation strain decreases. The concerted nature of the ene process has been supported experimentally, and the reaction can be designated as [σ2s + π2s + π2s] in the Woodward-Hoffmann notation. The early transition state proposed for the thermal ene reaction of propene with formaldehyde has an envelope conformation, with a C–O–H angle of 155°, as calculated at the 3-21G level of theory. Schnabel and co-workers have studied an uncatalyzed intramolecular carbonyl-ene reaction, which was used to prepare the cyclopentane fragment of natural and non-natural jatropha-5,12-dienes, members of a family of P-glycoprotein modulators. Their DFT calculations, at the B1B95/6-31G* level of theory for the reaction presented in Figure 3, propose that the reaction can proceed through one of two competing concerted and envelope-like transition states. The development of 1,3-transannular interactions in the disfavored transition state provides a good explanation for the selectivity of this process. The study of Lewis acid promoted carbonyl-ene reactions, such as aluminum-catalyzed glyoxylate-ene processes (Figure 4), prompted researchers to consider a chair-like conformation for the transition state of ene reactions which proceed with relatively late transition states. The advantage of such a model is the fact that steric parameters such as 1,3-diaxial and 1,2-diequatorial repulsions are easy to visualize, which allows for accurate predictions regarding the diastereoselectivity of many reactions. Radical mechanism. When a concerted mechanism is geometrically unfavorable, a thermal ene reaction can occur through a stepwise biradical pathway. Another possibility is a free-radical process, if radical initiators are present in the reaction mixture. For example, the ene reaction of cyclopentene and cyclohexene with diethyl azodicarboxylate can be catalyzed by free-radical initiators. As seen in Figure 5, the stepwise nature of the process is favored by the stability of the cyclopentenyl orcyclohexenyl radicals, as well as the difficulty of cyclopentene and cyclohexene in achieving the optimum geometry for a concerted process. Regioselection. Just as in the case of any cycloaddition, the success of an ene reaction is largely determined by the steric accessibility of the ene allylic hydrogen. In general, methyl and methylene H atoms are abstracted much more easily than methine hydrogens. In thermal ene reactions, the order of reactivity for the abstracted H atom is primary> secondary> tertiary, irrespective of the thermodynamic stability of the internal olefin product. In Lewis-acid promoted reactions, the pair enophile/Lewis acid employed determines largely the relative ease of abstraction of methyl vs. methylene hydrogens. The orientation of ene addition can be predicted from the relative stabilization of the developing partial charges in an unsymmetrical transition state with early formation of the σ bond. The major regioisomer will come from the transition state in which transient charges are best stabilized by the orientation of the ene and enophile. Internal asymmetric induction. In terms of the diastereoselection with respect to the newly created chiral centers, an endo preference has been qualitatively observed, but steric effects can easily modify this preference (Figure 6). Intramolecular ene reactions. Intramolecular ene reactions benefit from less negative entropies of activation than their intrermolecular counterparts, so are usually more facile, occurring even in the case of simple enophiles, such as unactivated alkenes and alkynes. The high regio- and stereoselectivities that can be obtained in these reactions can offer considerable control in the synthesis of intricate ring systems. Considering the position of attachment of the tether connecting the ene and enophile, Oppolzer has classified both thermal and Lewis acid-catalyzed intramolecular ene reactions as types I, II and III, and Snider has added a type IV reaction (Figure 7). In these reactions, the orbital overlap between the ene and enophile is largely controlled by the geometry of the approach of components. Lewis acid - catalyzed ene reactions. Advantages and rationale. Thermal ene reactions have several drawbacks, such as the need for very high temperatures and the possibility of side reactions, like proton-catalyzed olefin polymerization or isomerization reactions. Since enophiles are electron-deficient, it was reasoned that their complexation with Lewis acids should accelerate the ene reaction, as it occurred for the reaction shown in Figure 8. Alkylaluminum halides are well known as proton scavengers, and their use as Lewis acid catalysts in ene reactions has greatly expanded the scope of these reactions and has allowed their study and development under significantly milder conditions. Since a Lewis acid can directly complex to a carbonyl oxygen, numerous trialkylaluminum catalysts have been developed for enophiles that contain a C=O bond. In particular, it was found that Me2AlCl is a very useful catalyst for the ene reactions of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, as well as of other aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. The reason behind the success of this catalyst is the fact that the ene-adduct- Me2AlCl complex can further react to afford methane and aluminum alkoxide, which can prevent proton-catalyzed rearrangements and solvolysis (Figure 9). In the case of directed carbonyl-ene reactions, high levels of regio- and stereo-selectivity have been observed upon addition of a Lewis Acid, which can be explained through chair-like transition states. Notably, some of these reactions (Figure 10) can run at very low temperatures and still afford very good yields of a single regioisomer. Reaction conditions. As long as the nucleophilicity of the alkyl group does not lead to side reactions, catalytic amounts of Lewis acid are sufficient for many ene reactions with reactive enophiles. Nonetheless, the amount of Lewis acid can widely vary, as it largely depends on the relative basicity of the enophile and the ene adduct. In terms of solvent choice for the reactions, the highest rates are usually achieved using halocarbons as solvents; polar solvents such as ethers are not suitable, as they would complex to the Lewis acid, rendering the catalyst inactive. Reactivity of enes. While steric effects are still important in determining the outcome of a Lewis acid catalyzed ene reaction, electronic effects are also significant, since in such a reaction, there will be a considerable positive charge developed at the central carbon of the ene. As a result, alkenes with at least one disubstituted vinylic carbon are much more reactive than mono or 1,2 disubstituted ones. Mechanism. As seen in Figure 11, Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions can proceed either through a concerted mechanism that has a polar transition state, or through a stepwise mechanism with a zwitterionic intermediate. The ene, enophile and choice of catalyst can all influence which pathway is the lower energy process. In general, the more reactive the ene or enophile-Lewis acid complex is, the more likely the reaction is to be stepwise.  Chiral Lewis acids for the asymmetric catalysis of carbonyl-ene reactions. Chiral dialkoxytitanium complexes and the synthesis of laulimalide. A current direction in the study of Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions is the development of asymmetric catalysts for C–C bond formation. Mikami has reported the use of a chiral titanium complex (Figure 12) in asymmetric ene reactions involving prochiral glyoxylat esters. The catalyst is prepared in situ from (i-PrO)2TiX2 and optically pure binaphthol, the alkoxy-ligand exchange being facilitated by the use of molecular sieves. The method affords α-hydroxy esters of high enantiomeric purities, compounds that represent a class of biological and synthetic importance (Figure 12). Since both (R)- and (S)-BINOL are commercially available in optically pure form, this asymmetric process allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of α-hydroxy esters and their derivatives. However, this method is only applicable to 1,1-disubstituted olefins, due to the modest Lewis acidity of the titanium-BINOL complex.  As shown in Figure 13, Corey and co-workers propose an early transition state for this reaction, with the goal of explaining the high enantioselectivity observed (assuming that the reaction is exothermic as calculated from standard bond energies). Even if the structure of the active catalyst is not known, Corey’s model proposes the following: the aldehyde is activated by complexation with the chiral catalyst (R)-BINOL-TiX2 via the formyl lone electron pair syn to the formyl hydrogen to form a pentacoordinate Ti structure. CH—O hydrogen bonding occurs to the stereoelectronically most favorable oxygen lone pair of the BINOL ligand. In such a structure, the top (re) face of the formyl group is much more accessible to a nucleophile attack, as the bottom (si) face is shielded by the neighboring naphtol moiety, thus affording the observed configuration of the product. The formal total synthesis of laulimalide (Figure 14) illustrates the robustness of the reaction developed by Mikami. Laulimalide is a marine natural product, a metabolite of various sponges that could find a potential use as an anti-tumor agent, due to its ability to stabilize microtubuli. One of the key steps in the strategy used for the synthesis of the C3-C16 fragment was a chirally catalyzed ene reaction that installed the C15 stereocenter. Treatment of the terminal allyl group of compound 1 with ethyl glyoxylate in the presence of catalytic (S)-BINOL-TiBr2 provided the required alcohol in 74% yield and >95% ds. This method eliminated the need for a protecting group or any other functionality at the end of the molecule. In addition, by carrying out this reaction, Pitts et al. managed to avoid the harsh conditions and low yields associated with installing exo-methylene units late in the synthesis. Chiral C2-symmetric Cu(II) complexes and the synthesis of (+)-azaspiracid-1. Evans and co-workers have devised a new type of enantioselective C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts to which substrates can chelate through two carbonyl groups. The catalysts were found to afford high levels of asymmetric induction in several processes, including the ene reaction of ethyl glyoxylate with different unactivated olefins. Figure 15 reveals the three catalysts they found to be the most effective in affording gamma-delta-unsaturated alpha-hydroxy esters in high yields and excellent enantio-selectivities. What is special about compound 2 is that it is bench-stable and can be stored indefinitely, making it convenient to use. The reaction has a wide scope, as shown in Figure 16, owing to the high Lewis acidity of the catalysts, which can activate even weakly nucleophilic olefins, such as 1-hexene and cyclohexene. In the case of catalysts 1 and 2, it has been proposed that asymmetric induction by the catalysts results from the formation of a square-planar catalyst-glyoxylate complex (Figure 17), in which the Re face of the aldehyde is blocked by the tert-butyl substituents, thus allowing incoming olefins to attack only the Si face. This model does not account however for the induction observed when catalyst 3 was employed. The current view is that the geometry of the metal center becomes tetrahedral, such that the sterically shielded face of the aldehyde moiety is the Re face. Initially, the value of the method developed by Evans and coworkers was proved by successfully converting the resulting alpha-hydroxy ester into the corresponding methyl ester, free acid, Weinreb amide and alpha-azido ester, without any racemization, as shown in Figure 18. It is worth noting that the azide displacement of the alcohol that results from the carbonyl ene reaction provides a facile route towards the synthesis of orthogonally protected amino acids. The synthetic utility of the chiral C2-Symmetric Cu(II) catalysts was truly revealed in the formation of the C17 stereocenter of the CD ring fragment of (+)-azaspiracid-1, a very potent toxin (cytotoxic to mammalian cells) produced in minute quantities by multiple shellfish species including mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, and cockles. As shown in Figure 19, the reaction that establishes the C17 stereocenter is catalyzed by 1 mol % Cu(II) complex 2 (Figure 15), and the authors note that it can be conducted on a 20 g scale and still give very good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Furthermore, the product can be easily converted into the corresponding Weinreb amide, without any loss of selectivity, allowing for the facile introduction of the C14 methyl group. Thus, this novel catalytic enantioselective process developed by Evans and coworkers can be easily integrated into complex synthesis projects, particularly early on in the synthesis, when high yields and enantioselectivites are of utmost importance.

Her works are primarily serialized in ""Ribon"" magazine, with series published in collected volumes by Shueisha. For the 15th anniversary since her debut, she was involved in creating a CD featuring songs based on ten of her heroines. Tanemura contributed to a dōjinshi along with other manga artists that was sold for charity efforts for the March 2011 Japanese earthquake. As of November 2011, Tanemura has become a free agent manga artist, no longer solely affiliated with Shueisha. However, Sakurahime Kaden will continue to be published in Ribon magazine until the series is completed. Tanemura stated herself that a new series is planned during AnimeFest 2012 in Dallas, Texas. ""Sakura Hime Kaden"" recently ended in December 2012 on the 12th volume. Her newest series, ""Neko to Watashi no Kinyoubi"" (translation: ""The Cat and My Friday"") started on February 5th in ""Margaret"" magazine. She also has an upcoming series, ""31 Ai Dream"" that will serialized in Hakusensha's ""Melody"" magazine.

wikipedia-1256774," Angevin Empire  The term Angevin Empire is a modern term describing the collection of states once ruled by the Angevin Plantagenet dynasty. The Plantagenets ruled over an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland during the 12th and early 13th centuries, located north of the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon. This ""empire"", originally established by Henry Plantagenet, as Count of Anjou, and as Henry II, King of England, extended over roughly half of medieval France, all of England, and some of Ireland.  However, despite the extent of Plantagenet rule, his son John, King of England was defeated by the King of France, Philip II Augustus of the House of Capet, which left the empire split in two, having lost the provinces of Normandy and Anjou. This defeat, after which the ruling Plantagenets retained their English territories and the French province of Gascony, set the scene for the Saintonge and Hundred Years' War. Origin of the term and its application. The Angevin Empire is a neologism defining the lands of the Plantagenets: Henry II and his sons Richard I and John. Another son Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany ruled Brittany and established a separate line there. As far as historians know, there was no contemporary term for the region under Angevin control; however, descriptions such as ""our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be"" were used. The term ""Angevin Empire"" was coined by Kate Norgate in her 1887 publication, ""England under the Angevin Kings"". In France, the term ""Espace Plantagenêt"" (Plantagenet Area) is sometimes used to describe the fiefdoms the Plantagenets had acquired. The adoption of the ""Angevin Empire"" label marked a re-evaluation of the times, considering that both English and French influence spread throughout the dominion in the half century during which the union lasted. The term Angevin itself is the adjective applied to the residents of Anjou and its historic capital, Angers; the Plantagenets were descended from Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, hence the term. The use of the term ""Empire"" has engendered controversy among some historians, as the area was a collection of the lands inherited and acquired by Henry. It is unclear whether or not these dominions shared any common identity. Some historians argue that the term should be reserved solely for the Holy Roman Empire, the only Western European political structure actually named an empire at that time, although Alfonso VII of León and Castile had taken the title ""Emperor of all Spain"" in 1135. Other historians argue that Henry II's empire was neither powerful, centralised, nor large enough to be seriously called an empire. There was no imperial title, as implied by the term ""Angevin Empire"". However, even if the Plantagenets themselves did not claim any imperial title some chroniclers, often working for Henry II himself, did use the term ""empire"" to describe this assemblage of lands. In essence the highest title was ""king of England"", to which were added the titles of dukes and counts held in France that were completely and totally independent from the royal title, and not subject to any English royal law. Because of this some historians prefer the term ""commonwealth"" to ""empire"", emphasising that the Angevin Empire was more of an assemblage of seven fully independent, sovereign states loosely bound to each other. Geography and administration. At its largest extent, the Angevin Empire consisted of the Kingdom of England, the Lordship of Ireland, the duchies of Normandy, Gascony and Aquitaine (also called Guyenne) as well as of the Counties of Anjou, Poitou, Maine, Touraine, Saintonge, Marche, Périgord, Limousin, Nantes and Quercy. While the duchies and counties were held with various levels of vassalage to the King of France, the Plantagenets held various levels of control over the Duchies of Brittany and Cornwall, the Welsh princedoms, the county of Toulouse, and the Kingdom of Scotland, although those regions were not formal parts of the empire. Further claims were laid over Berry and Auvergne, but these were not fulfilled. The frontiers were sometimes well known and easy to draw, like the one between the royal Demesne of the King of France and the Duchy of Normandy. In other places they were not as clear, especially as regards the eastern frontier of Aquitaine where there often was a difference between the frontiers Henry II and, later, Richard I claimed and the ones where their real power ended. One of the most important characteristics of the Angevin Empire was its ""polycratic"" nature, a term taken from one of the most important political pamphlets written by a subject of the Angevin Empire: the ""Policraticus"" by John of Salisbury. In Aquitaine and Anjou, although ducal and comital authorities did exist, it was not homogeneous. For example, the Lusignan dynasty, powerful in these lands, proved important opponents of the Plantagenets. Economy and revenue. The economy of the Angevin Empire was quite complicated due to the varying political structure of the fiefdoms. Areas like England which had a centralised power structure generated larger revenues than the more loosely administrated regions such as Limousin; where local princes could mint their own coins. It is commonly believed that money raised in England was used for continental issues. Also, due to the high level of administration of England and, to a lesser extent, Normandy, it was the only area where revenue was fairly consistent. The English revenues themselves varied from year to year: In Ireland, the revenue was fairly low at a mere £2,000 for 1212; however, records are missing for the most part. For Normandy, there were a lot of fluctuations relative to the politics of the Duchy. In 1180, the Norman revenues were only £6,750 while they reached £25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England. What was more impressive was the fact the Norman population was considerably smaller than England's, an estimated 1.5 million as opposed to England's 3.5 million. For Aquitaine, Anjou and Gascony there is no record about revenues. It is not that these regions were poor; there were large vineyards, important cities and iron mines. This is what Ralph of Diceto, an English chronicler, wrote about Aquitaine: The Capetian kings did not record such incomes, although the royal principality was more centralized under Louis VII and Philip II than it had been under Hugh Capet or Robert the Pious. The wealth of the Plantagenet kings was definitely regarded as bigger, Gerald of Wales commented on this wealth with these words: Petit Dutailli had commented that: ""Richard maintained a superiority in resources which would have given him the opportunity, had he lived, to crush his rival."" There is another interpretation, not widely followed and proven wrong, that the king of France could have raised a stronger income, that the royal principality of the king of France generated alone more incomes than all of the Angevin Empire combined. Formation of the Angevin Empire (1135–1156). Context before the Anarchy. The Counts of Anjou had been vying for power in north-western France for a long time. The Counts were recurrent enemies of the Dukes of Normandy and of the Dukes of Brittany and sometimes even of the King himself. Fulk IV claimed rule over Touraine, Maine and Nantes; however, of these only Touraine proved to be effectively ruled, as the construction of the castles of Chinon, Loches and Loudun exemplify. Fulk IV married his son Fulk V to Eremburga, the heiress of Maine, thus unifying it with Anjou. While the dynasty of the Angevins was successful, their rivals, the Normans, had conquered England, while the Poitevins had become Dukes of Aquitaine as well as Dukes of Gascony and the Count of Blois became Count of Champagne. King Henry I of England had defeated his brother Robert Curthose, made an enemy of Robert's son William Clito (who became Count of Flanders in 1127), and used his paternal inheritance to claim the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England. Henry I tried to establish an alliance with Anjou against Flanders by marrying his only legitimate son, William Adelin, to Fulk V's daughter, but William died in the White Ship disaster in 1120. Then, Henry I married his daughter Matilda to Geoffrey V, however, the Anglo-Normans had to accept Matilda's inheritance to the throne of England. There had been only one occurrence of a medieval Europan queen regnant before, Urraca of Castile, and it wasn't an encouraging precedent; nevertheless, in January 1127 the Anglo-Normans barons and prelates recognized Matilda as heiress to the throne in an oath. On June 17, 1128, the wedding was celebrated in Le Mans. The Anarchy and the question of the Norman succession. In order to secure the succession, castles and supporters were needed in both England and Normandy. Had Matilda and Geoffrey succeeded, there would have been two authorities in England: King Henry I and his daughter, Matilda. Henry I prevented the disunion by refusing to hand over any castle to Matilda as well as confiscating the lands of the nobles he suspected of supporting her. By 1135, major disputes between Henry I and Matilda drove the barons loyal to Henry I against Matilda. In November 1135, Henry ""Beauclerc"" was dying; Matilda was with her husband in Maine and Anjou while Stephen of Blois, Matilda's cousin and another contender for the throne, was in Boulogne. Stephen rushed to England upon the news of Henry I's death and was crowned King of England in December 1135. Geoffrey V first sent Matilda alone to Normandy, in a diplomatic mission to be recognized Duchess of Normandy to replace Stephen. However, Geoffrey V was not far behind, at the head of his army, and he quickly captured several fortresses in southern Normandy, which he was never to lose. It was then that an Angevin noble, Robert III of Sablé, rose up, opening a front on Geoffrey's rear and forcing him to withdraw to Anjou to end the revolt. When Geoffrey V returned to Normandy in September 1136, the region was plagued with local struggles and infighting among the barons. Stephen was not able to travel to Normandy and as result, the situation remained chaotic. Geoffrey had found new allies with the Count of Vendôme and, most importantly, the Duke of Aquitaine. At the head of a new army and prepared to conquer Normandy, Geoffrey V was wounded and was forced to return to Anjou once more. Adding to that, an outbreak of diarrhea plagued his army. Orderic Vitalis stated ""the invaders had to run for home leaving a trail of filth behind them"". Stephen finally arrived in Normandy in 1137 and restored order, but he had lost much of credibility in the eyes of his supporter Robert of Gloucester. Geoffrey took control of the strongholds of Caen and Argentan without resistance, but he now had to defend Robert's possession in England against the anger of the King. In 1139, Robert and Matilda crossed the channel and arrived in England while Geoffrey kept the pressure on Normandy. Stephen was captured in February 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln, which prompted the collapse of Normandy. Geoffrey now controlled almost all of Normandy, but no longer had the support of Aquitaine. King Louis VII of France was now Duke of Aquitaine by his marriage to Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1137; he had no interest in the shifts in Norman politics, since he already ruled vast and powerful territories. While Geoffrey V asserted control of Normandy, Matilda was suffering defeats against Stephen's allies. At Winchester, Robert of Gloucester was captured while covering Matilda's retreat. Matilda freed Stephen in exchange for Robert. In 1142, Geoffrey V was beseeched to cross the Channel to assist Matilda but he refused; he had become more interested in Normandy. Following the capture of Avranches, Mortain and Cherbourg, Geoffrey V launched a decisive attack on Rouen capturing it in 1144. He then anointed himself as Duke of Normandy and, in exchange for the cession of Gisors to Louis VII, was formally recognized by the King. Satisfied with his new role in Normandy, Geoffrey V made no effort to assist Matilda in England even as she was on the verge of defeat. Helie (Elias), Geoffrey's younger brother, felt that he deserved his fair share and asked for Maine. No sooner had that issue been settled, another Angevin noble rebelled: Gerald Berlay, newly appointed seneschal of Poitou by Louis VII, led a revolt in southern Anjou against Geoffrey V. Accession of Henry and nominal foundation of the Angevin Empire. Stephen had by no means given up his claims on Normandy. Even though Louis VII had clearly recognised Geoffrey Plantagenet as duke, an alliance between the two Kings was possible because of the issue over Gerald Berlay. Louis VII agreed to recognise Geoffrey's son Henry as the new duke in 1151 in exchange of concessions in Norman Vexin. The death of Geoffrey, aged only 38, made Henry count of Anjou in 1151. According to the story told by William of Newburgh (in the 1190s) Geoffrey declared that Henry would have to hand down Anjou to one of his young brothers, also called Geoffrey, if he was to win the crown of England. To compel Henry to follow his will, Geoffrey V had ordered that he be left without sepulture until Henry swore an oath that he would renounce Anjou if he were to acquire England. In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine divorced under the pretext of consanguinity at the council of Beaugency because the couple was not getting along. The terms of the divorce left Eleanor as Duchess of Aquitaine but under rule of the King; eight weeks later she married Henry (who was no less related to her than was Louis VII). With Henry thus becoming Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony, it was obvious he would never give Anjou up to his brother, since it would mean splitting his land into two parts. A coalition of all of Henry's enemies was set up by Louis VII: King Stephen of England and his son Eustace IV of Boulogne (married to Louis' sister), Henry the Liberal (promised to Eleanor's daughter), Robert of Dreux (Louis VII's brother) and Geoffrey who no longer had hope of being given Anjou. In July 1152, Capetian troops attacked Aquitaine while Louis VII himself, along with Eustace IV, Henry of Champagne and Robert of Dreux attacked Normandy. Geoffrey raised a revolt in Anjou while Stephen attacked Angevin loyalists in England. Several Anglo-Norman nobles switched allegiance, sensing an impending disaster. Henry was about to sail for England to pursue his claim when his lands were attacked. He first reached Anjou and compelled Geoffrey to surrender. He then took the decision to sail for England in January 115 to meet Stephen. Luckily enough Louis VII fell ill and had to retire from the conflict while Henry's defences held against his enemies. After seven months of both battles and political gambles Henry failed to get rid of King Stephen; then Eustace IV died in dubious circumstances, ""struck by the wrath of god."" This was the last straw and King Stephen gave up the struggle by ratifying the Treaty of Winchester. He made Henry his heir on condition that the land possessions of his family were guaranteed in England and France—the same terms Matilda had refused after her victory at Lincoln. Henry became Henry II of England in December 1154. Subsequently the question was again raised of Henry's oath to cede Anjou to his brother Geoffrey. Henry II received a dispensation from Pope Adrian IV under the pretext the oath had been forced upon him, and he proposed compensations to Geoffrey at Rouen in 1156, but the latter refused and returned to Anjou to rise once again against his brother. If Geoffrey had a solid moral claim, his position was nonetheless weak. Louis VII would not interfere since Henry II paid homage to the King of France for Normandy, Anjou and Aquitaine as vassal. Henry II crushed Geoffrey's revolt, and Geoffrey had to be satisfied with an annual pension. Expansions of the Angevin Empire. Henry II clearly claimed further lands and worked on the creation of a ring of vassal states, especially around England and Normandy, as buffers. The most obvious ones were Scotland, Wales, Brittany and Flanders, which could be also used as starting points for further expansions. David of Scotland had taken advantage of The Anarchy to seize Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. In Wales important leaders like Rhys of Deheubarth and Owain Gwynedd had emerged. In Brittany, there is no evidence that the Duke of Brittany, namely Eudes, had recognised the Norman overlordship. Two vital frontier castles, Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins, had never been taken back by Geoffrey Plantagenet and were in the hands of Robert of Dreux. Count Thierry of Flanders had joined the alliance formed by Louis VII in 1153. Further south, the Count of Blois acquired Amboise. From Henry II's perspective, there were some issues to solve. King Henry II showed himself to be an audacious and daring king; he was also active and mobile. Though he was often more present in France than in England as Ralph of Diss, Dean of St Paul's, said with irony: Castles and strongholds in France. Henry II bought Vernon and Neufmarché back in 1154. From now on this new strategy regulated the Plantagenets-Capetians relationship. Louis VII couldn't deny his own unsuccessful attempt at breaking Henry II down. Because of the Angevin control of England in 1154 it was pointless to object to the superiority of the overall Angevin forces over the Capetian ones. Yet, Henry II wouldn't stop claiming the land until the Norman Vexin was entirely recovered. Thomas Beckett was sent as ambassador to Paris in 1158 for leading negotiations and he displayed all the wealth the Angevins could boast of to the Capetians. Louis VII's daughter, Margaret who was still a baby was promised to Henry the ""future young king"" (King Henry II's son). Although a baby, Margaret was old enough to be given a dowry at her wedding. This dowry happened to be the Norman Vexin. Henry II was given back the castles of Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins. Theobald the Good handed Amboise back to him. Flanders. Although Dietrich of Alsace had taken part in the assaults against Henry II along with Louis VII the wool trade between England and Flanders favoured a cordial relationship between the two men up to the point that the Count appointed Henry II guardian of his lands so that he undertake on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem without concerns. In 1159, William of Blois died without an inheritance, he was Stephen's last son, leaving the titles of Count of Boulogne and Count of Mortain vacant. Henry II absorbed the County of Mortain but wanted to grant Boulogne to Thierry's son, Matthew, who married Marie of Boulogne. The title of Count of Boulogne was accompanied with important manors in London and Colchester. England traded much of its wool with Flanders via the port of Boulogne. An alliance with these two counties was then logically sealed by this wedding and the concessions of manors. Henry II had to get Marie out of her convent first, which had been a common practice in England since the Normans. In 1163, the few official remaining documents showed Henry II and Thierry renewed the treaty signed by William the Conqueror. Flanders would provide Henry II with knights in exchange of an annual tribute in money. Brittany. In Brittany, the duke Conan III declared his son Hoël a bastard and disinherited him. It was his sister Bertha who became Duchess of Brittany making her husband of the time, Eudes, nominally Duke. Hoël was then co-ruler with his brother in law, and had to be satisfied as Count of Nantes. Bertha was the widow of Alan de Bretagne with whom she already had a son, Conan. Conan who had become Earl of Richmond in 1148 was Henry II's perfect candidate to become the new Duke of Brittany as any Duke with possessions of importance in England could be easier to control. In 1156, the Duchy of Brittany was hit by civil unrest which led to Conan IV's accession while in Nantes the population called for Henry II's help against Hoël. Geoffrey (Henry II's brother again) was made new Count of Nantes by Henry II, but he did not hold the position for long, as he died in 1158 at only 24 years of age. In 1158, Conan IV briefly ruled as Count of Nantes however, Henry II took the title that same year by mustering an army in Avranches to threaten Conan. In 1160 Henry II married his cousin Margaret of Scotland to Conan in an arranged wedding. He then appointed the archbishop of Dol. Without a tradition of a strong rule in Brittany, discontent grew among the nobles. This led to a revolt that Henry II answered in 1166. He betrothed his own 7-year-old son, Geoffrey, to Conan's daughter and later forced Conan to abdicate for his future son-in-law, making Henry II the ruler of Brittany, yet not the Duke. Breton nobles strongly opposed this, and more attacks on Brittany followed, first in 1167, then in 1168, and finally in 1173. Each of these invasions were followed by confiscations, and Henry II installed his men, William Fitzhamo and Rolland of Dinan, in the area. Although it was not formally part of the Plantagenet fiefdom, Brittany was under firm control. Scotland. Henry II met Malcolm IV in 1157 about Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland previously seized by his grandfather, David I of Scotland. In 1149, before Henry II became powerful, he made an oath to David that the lands north of Newcastle should belong to the King of Scotland forever. Malcolm reminded him of this oath but Henry II did not comply. There is no evidence that Henry II got a dispensation from the pope this time, as William of Newburgh put it, ""prudently considering it was the king of England who had the better of the argument by reason of his much greater power."" Malcolm IV gave up and paid homage in return for Huntingdon, which he inherited from his father. William the Lion, the next King of Scotland, was unhappy with Henry II since he was given Northumberland by David I in 1152 and therefore lost it to Henry II when Malcolm IV handed it back in 1157. As a part of the coalition set by Louis VII, William the Lion first invaded Northumberland in 1173 and then again in 1174, as a result he was captured near Alnwick and had to sign the tough Treaty of Falaise. Garrisons were to be set in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick. Southern Scotland was from then under firm control just as Brittany was. Richard I of England would end the Treaty of Falaise in exchange for money to fund his own crusade, setting a context for cordial relationships between the two awe- inspiring kings. Wales. Rhys of Deheubarth, also called Lord Rhys, and Owain Gwynedd were closed to negotiations. Henry II had to attack Wales three times, in 1157, 1158 and 1163 to have them answer his summons to the court. The Welsh found his terms too harsh and largely revolted against him. Henry then undertook a fourth invasion in 1164, this time with a massive army. According to the Welsh chronicle ""Brut y Tywysogion"", Henry raised ""a mighty host of the picked warriors of England and Normandy and Flanders and Anjou and Gascony and Scotland"" in order to ""carry into bondage and to destroy all the Britons."" Bad weather, rains, floods, and constant harassment from the Welsh armies slowed the Angevin army and prevented the capture of Wales (see the Battle of Crogen); a furious Henry II had Welsh hostages mutilated. Wales would remain safe for a while, but the invasion of Ireland in 1171 pressured Henry II to end the issue through negotiations with Lord Rhys. Ireland. Further plans of expansion were considered as Henry II's last brother didn't have a fiefdom. The Holy See was most likely to support a campaign in Ireland which would bring its church into the Christian Latin world of Rome. Henry II was given Rome's blessing in 1155 under the form of a Papal bull but had to postpone the invasion of Ireland because of all the issues in his domains and around them. In the terms of the Bull ""Laudabiliter"", ""Laudably and profitably does your magnificence contemplate extending your glorious name on earth."" William X, Count of Poitou died in 1164 without being installed in Ireland, but Henry II didn't gave up on the conquest of Ireland. In 1167 -Dermot of Leinster- an Irish King, was recognised as ""prince of Leinster"" by Henry II and was allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales to use in Ireland against the other Kings. The knights first met great success in carving themselves lands in Ireland, so much it worried Henry II enough to land himself in Ireland in October 1171 near Waterford and confronted to such demonstration of power most native kings of Ireland recognised him as their lord. Even Rory O' Connor, the king of Connacht who claimed to be High King of Ireland paid homage to Henry II. Henry II installed some of his men in strongholds like Dublin and Leinster (as Dermot was dead). He also gave unconquered kingdoms such as Cork, Limerick and Ulster to his men and left the Normans carving their lands in Ireland. In 1177 he made John, his son, the first Lord of Ireland, though John was too young and landed in Ireland only in 1185. He failed to install his authority on the land and had to return to Henry II. Only 25 years later John would return to Ireland while others built castles and installed their interests. Toulouse. Much less tenable was the claim over Toulouse. Eleanor's ancestors claimed the huge County of Toulouse as it used to be the central power of the ancient Duchy of Aquitaine back in the times of Odo the Great. Henry II and maybe even Eleanor were probably totally unrelated to this ancient line of dukes (Eleanor was a Ramnulfid while Henry II was an Angevin). Toulouse was a very large city, heavily fortified and much richer than many cities of the time. It was of strategical importance as it is between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. The County of Toulouse was the largest state of the Kingdom of France with its large access to the Mediterranean Sea itself, and included significant cities like Narbonne, Cahors, Albi, Nîmes and Carcassonne. Toulouse wasn't easy prey though. The city was incredibly large and fortified for a medieval city. Not to mention the least, Raymond V was married to Louis VII's sister therefore attacking Toulouse would have endangered the policy of peace with the King of France. The County of Toulouse had also many heavily fortified areas like Carcassonne and its five sons: Queribus, Aguila, Termes, Peyrepertuse and Puylaurens and many more castles and fortified cities. In June 1159 Henry II gathered in Poitiers what probably was the biggest army he had ever sent, formed by troops from all of his fiefdom (from Gascony to England), that army also included reinforcements sent by Thierry and Malcolm IV. Henry II attacked from the north while other of his allies, namely the Trencavels and Ramon Berenguer opened a different front. Henry II couldn't capture Toulouse proper and the recurrent conflicts with Toulouse would be called the Forty Years War with Toulouse by William of Newburgh. Henry II captured Cahors though as well as various castles in the Garonne valley (in the Quercy region), he came back in 1161 and then too busy with conflicts elsewhere in his fiefdom he left his allies fighting against Toulouse. Alfonso II the King of Aragon himself having interests there joined the war. In 1171 Henry II set an alliance with Humbert of Maurienne adding one more enemy of Raymond V to his alliance. In 1173, in Limoges, Raymond finally gave up after over a decade of constant fights. He paid homage to Henry II, to his son also called Henry and to his other son Richard the Lionheart newly appointed new Duke of Aquitaine. Pinnacle of the Angevin Empire (1160–1199). Louis VII was known by his contemporaries for his piety and love of peace. Stephen of Paris wrote of King Louis VII: Even Walter Map, a contemporary English satirical chronicler, had been kind toward Louis VII and praised him marking a contrast with the harsh critiques he did toward other kings. King Louis VII was a man of peace who hated violence and war but the attacks on Toulouse made clear that peace with Henry II wasn't peace at all but just the opportunity to make war elsewhere. Louis VII himself was in an awkward position: his subject was more powerful than he was by a large degree and worst of all he had no male heir. Constance, his second wife, died in childbirth in 1160 and Louis VII announced he would remarry at once, in the urgent need of a male heir, with Adèle of Champagne. The young Henry was finally married to Margaret aged only 2, under the pressure of Henry II, and as declared in 1158 the Norman Vexin went to him as the dowry. Had Louis VII died without a male heir, Henry the Young would have been in a comfortable position to become the next King of France himself. In 1164 King Louis found a dangerous ally in Archbishop Thomas Becket. King Louis and Becket had met previously in 1158, but now the circumstances were very different. Louis had got already a few clerical refugees in his land, and was then called ""Rex Christianisimus"" (most Christian king) by John of Salisbury. Indeed there were growing conflicts between the king of England and the archbishop and Henry II provoked Becket's murder by pronouncing words like, ""What miserable traitors have I nourished in my household who led their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerck!"" Becket was murdered in 1170, and the Christian world put the blame on Henry. By contrast, Louis, who had protected Becket, gained widespread approval. Although his secular power was still much weaker than Henry's, Louis now had the moral advantage. In 1165, the idea of a possible succession of Henry the Young to the throne of France was all gone away when Adèle gave birth to a son, named Philip. With the arrival of a clear French heir, the fragile peace was at an end. In 1167 Henry II marched on Auvergne, and in 1170 he also attacked Bourges. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges. At that point, not just Louis VII was wondering if Henry II's expansionism would ever end. Henry II never treated his land as a coherent sovereign but much more as private possessions he planned to distribute to his children. Henry the young was crowned King of England in 1170 though he never actually ruled; Richard the Lionheart became Duke of Aquitaine in 1172; Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany in 1181; John became Lord of Ireland in 1185; while Leonora (born in 1161) was promised to Alfonso VII with Gascony as dowry during the campaign against Toulouse in 1170. This partition of the lands between his children made it much harder for him to control them, as several of them would then turn against him. Following his coronation Henry the Young King asked for part of his inheritance, at least England or Normandy or Anjou, but Henry II refused. Henry the Young then joined Louis VII at his court, while Eleanor of Aquitaine herself joined the conflict and both Richard the Lionheart and Geoffrey of Brittany joined their brother at the court of the King. From then, states that Henry II had pressured joined the conflict against him. Another King to join Louis VII was William the Lion, King of Scotland. Philip, the Count of Flanders also joined the conflict, as well as the Count of Boulogne and Theobald the Count of Blois. Henry II emerged victorious: because of his wealth he could recruit very large amount of mercenaries, and he had captured and imprisoned Eleanor early on as well as captured William the Lion and forced him into the Treaty of Falaise. Henry II bought the County of Marche, then he asserted the French Vexin and Bourges should be given at once, but this time there was no invasion to back the claim. Philip II Augustus and Richard I the Lionheart. Louis VII died and was buried in the Saint Denis Basilica in 1180. His son, aged only 15, ascended to the throne of France in 1183. Philip II of France's policy was to use Henry II's sons against him. Richard the Lionheart administered Aquitaine since 1175 but his policy of centralisation of the Aquitanian government had grown unpopular in the eastern part of the Duchy, notably Périgord and Limousin. Richard the Lionheart was accused of many crimes there, including murders and rapes. If Richard was unpopular in Aquitaine, Philip II was equally unliked by his contemporaries with comments describing him as: ""astute, manipulative, calculating, penurious and ungallant ruler."" In 1183, Henry the Young King joined a revolt led by Limoges and Geoffrey of Lusignan against Richard in order to take Richard's place. They were joined by Philip II, Raymond V and by Duke Hugh III of Burgundy. Henry the Young died suddenly of a fatal illness in 1183, saving Richard's position. Henry the Young King was buried in Notre Dame de Rouen. Richard was then Henry II's oldest son and inherited much of Henry the Young King's status. Henry II ordered him to hand down Aquitaine to John Lackland, but Richard refused to comply. Henry II had too much to cope with at the time to take care of this: Welsh princes were now contesting his authority, William the Lion was asking for his castles to be given back and as Henry the Young was dead Philip II asked for the Norman Vexin to be given back. Henry II finally asked Richard I to surrender Aquitaine to Eleanor while Richard retained the control. Still in 1183, Raymond V had taken Cahors back and Henry II asked Richard to mount an expedition against Toulouse. Geoffrey of Brittany was quarrelling violently with his brother Richard and it was obvious Geoffrey could be used by the Capetians, but his sudden death in 1186 in a tournament killed the plot. In 1187, Philip II and Richard were more than strong allies, as Roger of Hoveden reported: In 1188 Raymond V attacked again, joined by the Lusignans. It was rumoured that Henry II himself financed the revolts. By this time Philip II attacked Henry II in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry. In 1188, Philip II and Henry II met to discuss peace again, Henry II refused to make Richard his heir. One story reports that Richard said ""Now at last, I must believe what I had always thought impossible."" This was the final collapse of all Henry's strategy. First Richard paid homage to the King of France for all the lands his father held. As Richard and Philip II attacked Henry II no one in Aquitaine stood for him and the Bretons seized the opportunity to attack him too. Even Henry's birthplace, Le Mans, was captured and Tours also soon fell. He was simply encircled in his castle of Chinon. Henry was finally compelled to surrender. He gave a large tribute in money to Philip II and swore that all his subjects in France and England would recognise Richard as their lord. Henry II died two days later, learning John had joined Richard and Philip. The old king was buried in Fontevraud Abbey. Eleanor, who was Henry's hostage, was then freed while Lord Rhys raised and began to reconquer the southern parts of Wales that Henry had annexed. Richard I was crowned King in Westminster Abbey in November 1189, while he was already installed as Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine. Philip II asked for the Norman Vexin to be given back but the issue was settled when Richard I announced he would marry Alys, Philip II's sister. Richard I also recognised Auvergne was meant to belong to the crown of France and not to the Duke of Aquitaine ending Henry's claim on the place. In Britain King William of Scotland opened negotiations with King Richard of England (the two lion kings) to revoke the Treaty of Falaise and an agreement was reached. The Third Crusade. The next priority was the crusade, it had been delayed long enough and Richard I considered it was time to do his religious duty. Beyond purely religious matter, his ancestor Fulk V had been King of Jerusalem and Guy de Lusignan was a Poitevin noble while his wife -Sybilla- was no less than Richard's cousin. The crusade as well as French issues would be the reason for Richard's absence in England: the Lion Heart would spend less than six months of his reign in England. Before leaving, Richard I had to make sure nothing went wrong while he was in the Holy Land. There was little doubt Raymond V would take the opportunity to expand his lands in Aquitaine. To counter that threat, he built an alliance with Sancho VI the Wise the King of Navarre. On the way to the Holy Land, Richard I married Berengaria the princess of Navarre in 1191, therefore repudiating Alys. To calm down Philip II, he accepted that if he had two sons the youngest should take Normandy or Aquitaine or Anjou and rule it for the King of France. The administration left behind worked rather well, as an attack from the Count of Toulouse was repelled with the help of Sancho VI. The Siege of Acre was over. (Richard I had also upset Leopold V the Virtuous by removing his banner from Acre.) Much has been said about the reasons Philip II went back to France; it is often considered his dysentery was the principal reason. Other causes could have been the way his sister had been treated by Richard I or that he couldn't stand that his subject had more power and wealth than he did or even that following the Count of Flanders's death, Philip came back to ask for his share of the land of Artois. Richard I left Palestine in October 1192 and would have retrieved his lands intact had he reached home in time. But Leopold V arrested him near Vienna, accusing him of the murder of his cousin Conrad, and then handed him down to Emperor Henry VI. John Lackland was summoned to Philip II's court and accepted to marry Alys with no less than Artois has a dowry. In return, the entire Norman Vexin would be given to the King of France. After all, no one was sure if Richard I would be ever released. Yet, all of the forces John could gather were a bunch of mercenaries as even William the Lion did not join his revolt and also sent money for Richard's ransom. Another revolt in Aquitaine was suppressed by Elias de la Celle, but in Normandy Philip II himself was leading the operations. By April 1193 he had reached Rouen and although the ducal capital couldn't be taken, he and his allies were then controlling all the ports from the Rhine to Dieppe. Confronted to the situation, Richard's regents conceded the Treaty of Mantes in July 1193, confirming Philip II's control on all the land he had taken including the entire Norman Vexin, the castles of Drincourt and Arques in Normandy and the castles of Loches and Châtillon in Tourraine as well as adding a substantial payment once Richard is back. In a new treaty in 1194, concessions to the King of France went much further, when Tours with all the castles of Tourraine and all of Eastern Normandy except for Rouen were surrendered. The County of Angoulême was declared independent of Aquitaine, Vendôme was given to Louis of Blois and Geoffrey III of Perche acquired Moulins and Bonmoulins. Emperor Henry VI finally released Richard I in 1194 in exchange of the ransom. Richard freed, recovers his lands, and finally dies. Richard I was in a difficult position, Philip II had taken over large parts of his lands and had inherited of Amiens and Artois. England was Richard's most secure possessions, Hubert Walter who had been to the crusade with the King of England was appointed his justiciar. King Richard took over John's lordship over Ireland and rejected William the Lion's claim over the northern territories. Richard I had merely crossed the English Channel to claim back his territories that John Lackland betrayed Philip II by murdering the garrison of Évreux and handing the town down to Richard I. ""He had first betrayed his father, then his brother and now our King"" said William the Breton. Sancho the Strong, the future King of Navarre, joined the conflict and attacked Aquitaine, capturing Angoulème and Tours. Richard himself was known to be a great military commander. The first part of this war was difficult for Richard who suffered several setbacks, for Philip II was also a great commander and politician. But by October the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, left the Capetian side and joined Richard's. He was followed by Baldwin IV of Flanders, the future Latin Emperor, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II. In 1197, Henry VI died and was replaced by Otto IV, Richard I's own nephew. Renaud de Dammartin, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II. Baldwin IV was invading Artois and captured Saint-Omer while Richard I was campaigning in Berry and inflicted a severe defeat to Philip II at Gisors, close to Paris. A truce was accepted, and Richard I had almost recovered all Normandy and now held more territories in Aquitaine than he had before. Richard I had to deal with a revolt once again, but this time from Limousin. He was struck by a bolt in April 1199 at Châlus-Chabrol and died of a subsequent infection. His body was buried at Fontevraud like his father. John's reign and the collapse (1199–1217). John was not king yet; he had to fight to keep his lands. Following the news of Richard's death, Philip II captured Évreux in a rush. John tried to take the Angevin treasure and the castle of Chinon to install his power. But, in the local custom, the son of an older brother was preferred to a claimant. Henceforth they recognised Arthur as their ruler, son of Geoffrey of Brittany, depriving John of the Angevins' ancestral land. Only in Normandy and England he could install his rule. In Rouen, Normandy, he was made Duke in April 1199 and he was crowned King of England in May at Westminster Abbey. He left his mother, Eleanor, controlling Aquitaine. His allies, Aimeri of Thouars and three Lusignan nobles led an attack on Tours in an attempt to capture Arthur and install John as count. Aimeri of Thouars was promised the title of seneschal had he captured Arthur. By this time John went to Normandy to negotiate a truce with Philip II. He took profit of this truce to gather Richard's former allies, especially the Count of Boulogne, the Count of Flanders and the Holy Roman Emperor. In the end no less than 15 French counts swore allegiance to John who was now definitely in a much stronger position than Philip II. A strong supporter of the King—William des Roches—even switched side in front of so much power and handed down Arthur, whom he was supposed to protect, to John. Arthur managed to escape and join Philip II's court very soon though. It was also the moment the Count of Flanders and many knights decided to join the crusade in 1199 and deserted John's court. John's dominant position was short-lived and then he had to accept the Treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. Philip II was confirmed over the lands he had taken in Normandy joined by further concessions in Auvergne and Berry. John was recognised at the head of Anjou in return of what he swore he would not interfere if Baldwin IV or Otto IV attacked Philip II. The Lusignans' case and decisive defeats. Hugh IX of Lusignan took Eleanor in hostage; John then recognised him as Count of Marche, thus expanding Lusignan power in the region. In August 1200, John had his first marriage annulled and he married Isabella who was already betrothed to Hugh X. John then confiscated La Marche. The Lusignans themselves called for Philip II's intervention, and he summoned John to his court. John refused to meet his King, so Philip II used his power of suzerainty to confiscate all the lands John held in France. Phillip then accepted Arthur's homage, granting Arthur control of Poitou, Anjou, Maine, and Tours in 1202. Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, joined Philip II, as did Renaud de Dammartin. Most of John's other allies were either in the Holy Land or had deserted him. Of them, only Sancho VII the Strong remained, and he was in a weak position and unable to render much assistance to John. Arthur launched an attack in Poitou with his Lusignan allies, while Philip II attacked Normandy and captured many castles on the frontier. John was in Le Mans when the attacks were launched and decided to move southward. John's forces captured Arthur along with Hugh X and 200 knights; this success was quickly followed by the capture of the Viscount of Limoges, who John imprisoned in Chinon. The year 1202 was a time of triumph for John, who had distinguished himself from Richard I nor Henry II by successfully stifling his enemies. Unfortunately, John suffered from a fatal character flaw: ""he could not resist the temptation to kick a man when he was down."" He took pleasure in humiliating his enemies. After Arthur was murdered in prison (almost certainly at John's command), many of John's supporters deserted him. John's former allies, many of whom now actively fought against him, handed Alençon over to Philip II in Normandy. Vaudreuil was delivered to the King of France without a fight. John, who was trying to retake Alençon, was forced to withdraw once Philip II arrived. Château Gaillard itself had fallen in 1204 after a six-month siege; this was a devastating loss for the Angevins. Philip II continued campaigning in Normandy and successfully captured Argentan, Falaise, Caen, Bayeux and Lisieux in only three weeks. At the same time, a force of Breton knights captured the Mont Saint-Michel and Avranches. Tours fell in 1204, Loches and even Chinon followed in 1205; only Rouen and Arques continued to resist. Rouen finally capitulated and opened its gates to the King. The ducal castle was then destroyed and a bigger one was commissioned. Eleanor died in 1204. Most of the Poitevin nobles joined Philip II since they were loyal to Eleanor, but not to John. After Eleanor's death, Alfonso VIII asked for Gascony, which was part of the dowry Henry II had given his daughter. Gascony was one of the few French portions of the once-powerful ""Angevin Empire"" to remain loyal to the Angevins; the Gascons resisted Alfonso and the territory remained under John's control. The two kings finally agreed to a truce in 1206. The ""Angevin Empire"" had been reduced to only Gascony, Ireland, and England. Campaigns in the British Isles and return to France. John had to make his rule on the isles undisputed following the loss of Normandy and Anjou. He campaigned in South Wales in 1208, the Scottish border in 1209, Ireland in 1210, and North Wales in 1211. These campaigns often met with success. John used all resources he could muster to finance a campaign in France. Taxation of the Jews generated additional incomes, while all land property of the church was seized, which led to John's excommunication. In 1212, John was ready to land and invade France, but a revolt in Wales forced him to delay his plans and then a baronnal revolt in England made it worse. Philip II was then also in preparation for an invasion of England, but his fleet was destroyed while anchored at Damme by the Earl of Salisbury, William Longespee. Hearing of the news, John ordered all the forces he had set to defend England to sail for Poitou. He landed in La Rochelle in 1214 and was then allied with Renaud de Dammartin, Count Ferdinand of Flanders and of course with Otto IV. His allies would attack in the northeast of France while he would attack from the southwest. John went to Gascony and tried to install his garrison in Agens, but it was expelled. Unlike Normandy, Philip II had never invaded Poitou; it had just switched its allegiance. In order to invade Paris from England, it was much easier to go through Normandy than through the southwest. Thus, King Philip II concentrated his efforts there. The sword swung two ways, as for Philip II it was easier to launch an invasion of England from Normandy. As a consequence, Poitou was left without a strong royal presence. John betrothed his daughter, Joan, to Hugh IX of Lusignan's son Hugh X, in return for which the Lusignans were granted Saintonge and the Island of Oleron, as well as possibilities of further concessions in Touraine and Anjou. These were huge gains for the Lusignans, yet John called that ""bringing them to submit.""  Peter was the Duke of Brittany of the time. He was loyal to the King of France, but his claim to the rule of Brittany was fairly weak. If anything, Eleanor of Brittany had a stronger claim, as she was the elder sister of the defunct Arthur. John had her captured and used her as blackmail against Peter with one hand, while tempting him by offering Richmond with the other hand. Peter refused to change allegiance in the end, and not even the capture of his brother Robert III of Dreux near Nantes made him change his stance. John entered Angers and captured a newly built castle at Roche-au-Moine; but Prince Louis rushed from Chinon with an army and took it back by pushing John to retreat. Even though this was a setback, John had at least made the job of his allies easier by dividing the Capetian army. Then happened the disastrous Battle of Bouvines, in which all his allies were defeated by King Philip II. John was beaten, the economy of the Kingdom of England was bankrupted, and he was seen as a failed plunderer. All of the money that he could gather and all of the power that he used, brought nothing and his allies were all dead or captured. Unable to regain Brittany, he also abandoned the idea to release his niece, in order to prevent her potential threat to his throne, leading the deserted princess to end up in prison decades later. This quote, taken from ""Capetian France 987–1328"", summarises the reasons of the Angevin collapse: Capetians in England. In 1215, the English barons, convinced that John would not respect the terms of the recently signed Magna Carta, sent a letter to the French court offering the crown of England to Prince Louis, now a maternal grandson-in-law of Henry II. By November a Capetian garrison was sent to London to support the rebels. On 22 May 1216 Capetian forces landed at Sandwich led by Prince Louis himself. John fled, allowing Louis to capture London and Winchester. By August, Louis controlled most of eastern England; only Dover, Lincoln, and Windsor remained loyal to John. Even King Alexander II of Scotland travelled to Canterbury and paid homage to Prince Louis, recognizing him as King of England. John died two months later, defeated even in England. In contrast to John's failure to honour the terms of Magna Carta, the regency which followed him (Henry III being a minor) ruled in compliance with it. The Anglo-Norman barons therefore withdrew their support from Louis. He was defeated nearly a year later at Lincoln and Sandwich, and dropped his claim to the English crown by the Treaty of Lambeth in September 1217. Cultural influence. The hypothetical continuation and expansion of the Angevin Empire over several centuries has been the subject of several tales of alternate history. Historically both English and French historians had viewed the juxtaposition of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an aberration and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an encumbrance, while French historians considered the union to be an English empire. This is what Whig historian Macaulay, in 1849, wrote in his ""History of England"" about the union of the two lands. The Plantagenet kings adopted wine as their main drink, replacing the beer and cider used by the Norman kings. The ruling class of the Angevin Empire was also French speaking.  The 12th century is also the century of the Gothic architecture, first known as ""Opus Francigenum"", from the work of the Abbot Suger at Saint Denis in 1140. The Early English Period began around 1180 or 1190, in the times of the Angevin Empire, but this religious architecture was totally independent of the Angevin Empire, it was just born at the same moment and spread at those times in England. The strongest influence on architecture directly associated with the Plantagenets is about kitchens. Richard I's personal arms of three golden lions ""passant guardant"" on a red field appear in most subsequent English royal heraldry, and in variations on the flags of both Normandy and Aquitaine. From a political point of view the continental issues were given more attention from the monarchs of England than the British ones already under the Normans. Under Angevin lordship things became even more clear as the balance of power was dramatically set in France and the Angevin kings often spent more times in France than England. With the loss of Normandy and Anjou the fiefdom was cut in two and then the descendants of the Plantagenets can be regarded as English kings accounting Gascony in their domain. This is accordant with the newfound Lordship of Aquitaine being conferred upon the Black Prince of Wales, passing thence to the House of Lancaster, which had pretensions to the Crown of Castile, much as Edward III had to France. It was this assertion of power from England onto France and from Aquitaine onto Castile which marked the difference from earlier in the Angevin period. Further reading. Due to the nature of the Angevin Empire there are a good number of sources in French. Thus to enjoy the largest array of sources requires a good knowledge of both English and French. "
wikipedia-1256775," Sesa Goa  Sesa Goa Limited (BSE: 500295) is multinational iron-ore producer and exporter with operations in the states of Goa and Karnataka in India and in Liberia, West Africa. It is India's largest producer and exporter of iron ore in the private sector, with production of above 21 million tonnes of iron ore in fiscal year 2010. For more than five decades, it has been engaged in exploration, mining and processing of iron ore. The company was founded in 1954, as Scambi Economici SA Goa. Since then, it has grown to be one among the top low-cost producers of iron ore in the world. During 1991-1995, it diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke. It has also developed indigenous and environment-friendly technology for producing high quality metallurgical coke. In 2007, it became a majority-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui & Co., Ltd. In June 2009, Sesa Goa Limited acquired VS Dempo & Co. Private Limited (now Sesa Resources Limited) along with its fully owned subsidiary Dempo Mining Corporation (now Sesa Mining Corporation Limited) and 50% equity in Goa Maritime Private Limited. In 2011, Sesa acquired 51% stake in Western Cluster Limited, Liberia. Sesa Goa Limited’s operations are located predominantly in Goa and Karnataka, with offices in various locations across India. Its head office in India in Panaji, Goa, while its Liberia office is in Monrovia and China office is in Shanghai. History & Milestones. Brief Outline. Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963. Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under the Indian Companies Act 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited . In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd . Milestones. By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under the Indian Companies Act 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981 with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division. Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties - in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper ""M.V. Orissa"". The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa. In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. This mine is currently the company’s second largest mine in India. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip. Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A. Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001. In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern. In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth 40.7 billion, making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far. In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for 17.5 billion in an all-cash deal. This was the second largest acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 mn. The Liberian Gola Forest community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to allievate their sufferin g and provide employment. Products and Operations. Iron Ore: China is Sesa Goa’s largest client, accounting for 80% of its sales. The Goa operations for iron or mining consist of two areas—Codli and Sonshi. They also get their ore from several satellite mines across Goa. Codli is the largest iron ore producing mine of Sesa Goa with a current production capacity of more than 7.0 mtpa.

Sakurai left HAL on August 5, 2003, ending his work on the Kirby series. Reasons for his departure are said to be because he was seeking more freedom and was disappointed there, but most of all Sakurai grew tired of the sequelization from HAL. ""It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming,"" said Sakurai, in an interview with Nintendo Dream, two weeks after he resigned from HAL Laboratory. ""Even if it's a sequel (laughs), lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally."" His resignation came just days after an interview where he openly criticized the company for circumstances surrounding the development of the Nintendo GameCube racer ""Kirby Air Ride"". He has publicly stated that he wishes HAL to continue working on the ""Kirby"" series. After he left HAL, Sakurai began working with Q Entertainment, along with Tetsuya Mizuguchi. This collaboration resulted in ""Meteos"", a unique puzzle game for the Nintendo DS. On September 30, 2005, Sakurai announced that he had formed his own company, Sora.

wikipedia-1256791," User guide  A user guide or user's guide, also commonly known as a manual, is a technical communication document intended to give assistance to people using a particular system. It is usually written by a technical writer, although user guides are written by programmers, product or project managers, or other technical staff, particularly in smaller companies. User guides are most commonly associated with electronic goods, computer hardware and software. Most user guides contain both a written guide and the associated images. In the case of computer applications, it is usual to include screenshots of the human-machine interface(s), and hardware manuals often include clear, simplified diagrams. The language used is matched to the intended audience, with jargon kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly. Contents of a user manual. The sections of a user manual often include: Computer software manuals and guides. User manuals and user guides for most non-trivial software applications are book-like documents with contents similar to the above list. The ""PhotoMeister User's Manual"" is a good example of this type of document. Some documents have a more fluid structure with many internal links. The ""Google Earth User Guide"" is an example of this format. The term ""guide"" is often applied to a document that addresses a specific aspect of a software product. Some usages are ""Installation Guide"", ""Getting Started Guide"", and various ""How to"" guides. An example is the ""Picasa Getting Started Guide"". In some business software applications, where groups of users have access to only a sub-set of the application's full functionality, a user guide may be prepared for each group. An example of this approach is the ""Autodesk Topobase 2010 Help"" document, which contains separate ""Administrator Guides"", ""User Guides"", and a ""Developer's Guide"". These guides are a valuable tool for ""On-the-job"" training. "
wikipedia-1256799," Lee Child  Jim Grant (born 29 October 1954), better known by his pen name Lee Child, is a British thriller writer. His first novel, ""Killing Floor"", won the Anthony Award for Best First Novel. Each of Child's novels follows the adventures of a former American military policeman, Jack Reacher, who wanders the United States. Early life. Though Grant was born in Coventry, England, his parents moved him and his three brothers to Handsworth Wood in Birmingham when he was four years old, so that the boys could get a better education. Grant attended Cherry Orchard Primary School in Handsworth Wood until the age of 11. He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, also the ""alma mater"" of J. R. R. Tolkien and Enoch Powell. His father was a civil servant and his younger brother, Andrew Grant, is also a thriller novelist. In 1974, at age 20, Grant attended law school in Sheffield at Sheffield University, though he had no intention of entering the legal profession and, during his student days, worked backstage in a theatre. Instead, he took a job in commercial television after graduating. Career. Television production career. Grant joined Granada Television, part of the UK's ITV Network, in Manchester as a presentation director. There he was involved with shows including ""Brideshead Revisited"", ""The Jewel in the Crown"", ""Prime Suspect"", and ""Cracker."" Grant was involved in the transmission of more than 40,000 hours of programming for Granada, writing thousands of commercials, news stories, and trailers. He stayed with Granada 1977–1995 and ended his career there with two years as a trade union shop steward. Writing career. After being let go from his job because of corporate restructuring, Grant decided he wanted to start writing novels, stating they are ""the purest form of entertainment."" In 1997, his first novel, ""Killing Floor"", was published and he moved to the United States in the summer of 1998. His pen name ""Lee"" comes from a family joke about mispronunciation of the name of Renault's Le Car, while ""Child"" put his works on bookstore shelves between crime fiction stars Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie. Grant has said that he chose the name Reacher for the central character in his novels because he is himself tall and, in a supermarket (Asda in Kendal, Cumbria, when he was living in Kirkby Lonsdale), his wife Jane told him: ""Hey, if this writing thing doesn't pan out, you could always be a reacher in a supermarket.""... ""I thought, Reacher — good name."" Some books in the Reacher series are written in first person, while others are written in the third person. Child has characterized the books as revenge stories – ""Somebody does a very bad thing, and Reacher takes revenge"" – driven by his anger at the downsizing at Granada. Although British, he deliberately chose to write American-style thrillers.  In 2007, Grant collaborated with 14 other writers to create the 17-part serial thriller ""The Chopin Manuscript"" narrated by Alfred Molina that was broadcast weekly on Audible.com from 25 September 2007 to 13 November 2007. On 30 June 2008, it was announced that Grant would be taking up a Visiting Professorship at the University of Sheffield in the UK from November 2008. In 2009, Child funded 52 Jack Reacher scholarships for students at the university. Grant was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America in 2009. In 2012, his novel ""One Shot"" was adapted into ""Jack Reacher"", an American thriller film starring Tom Cruise. Child has a cameo as a police desk sergeant in the film. Writing style. Grant's prose has been described as ""hardboiled"" and ""commercial"" in style. A 2012 interview suggested that many aspects of the Jack Reacher novels were deliberately aimed at maintaining the books' profitability, rather than for literary reasons. For instance, having the character Jack Reacher having one parent who was French was suggested as being partly because the absence of any non-American members of Reacher's family would limit the books' appeal in France. The same interview stated that Child 'didn't apologise about the commercial nature' of his fiction. Philanthropy. In January 2012, Grant donated £10,000 towards a new vehicle for Brecon Mountain Rescue Team in Wales. He offered the donation because his brother is a senior member of the team. The team's former control vehicle was written off after a collision in 2011. Personal life. Grant's wife Jane is from New York. Child is a fan of Aston Villa Football Club. "
wikipedia-1256815," British Nationality Act 1981  The British Nationality Act 1981 was an Act of Parliament passed by the parliament of the United Kingdom concerning British nationality. It has been the basis of British nationality law since 1 January 1983. History. In the mid-1970s the British Government decided to update the nationality code, which had been significantly amended since the ""British Nationality Act 1948"" came into force on 1 January 1949. In 1977, a Green Paper was produced outlining options for reform of the nationality code. This was followed in 1980 by a White Paper containing the government's specific plans for change. The ""British Nationality Act 1981"" received Royal Assent on 30 October 1981 and came into force on 1 January 1983. Subsequently, the British Nationality Act has been significantly amended, including: Objectives of the Act. The Act had a number of purposes. Reclassification of United Kingdom and Colonies citizenship. The Act reclassified ""Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC)"" into three categories: Since 1962, with the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, not all CUKCs had the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom. The Act sought to restore once again the link between citizenship and right of abode by providing that British citizenship—held by those with a close connection with the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands—would ""automatically"" carry a right of abode in the UK. The other categories of British nationality would not hold such status based on nationality, although in some cases would do so under the immigration laws. Whilst in opposition in 1977, the Conservative Party asked Edward Gardner to chair a study group to provide advice on changes to the nationality laws. The resultant Green paper, ""Who Do We Think We Are?"", was published in 1980 and its threefold definition of nationality formed the basis for the Government's legislation. Originally the paper proposed just two categories of British nationality, British citizenship and British Overseas citizenship. However, the British Dependent Territory governments successfully lobbied for an additional category of nationality, which would cater for those with close connections to any of the British territories. Modification of ""jus soli"". The Act also modified the application of ""jus soli"" in British nationality. Prior to the Act coming into force, any person born in Britain (with limited exceptions such as children of diplomats and enemy aliens) was entitled to British citizenship. After the Act came into force, it was necessary for at least one parent of a United Kingdom-born child to be a British citizen ""or"" ""settled"" in the United Kingdom (a permanent resident). As a result, even following the coming into force of the Act, the vast majority of children born in the United Kingdom still acquire British citizenship at birth. Special provisions are made for non-British UK born children to acquire British citizenship in certain circumstances. Other changes. The Act made a variety of other changes to the law: In some cases, transitional arrangements were made that preserved certain aspects of the old legislation. Most of these expired on 31 December 1987, five years after the Act came into force. Criticisms. Critics argued that one of the main political motivations behind the new law was to deny most Hong Kong-born ethnic Chinese the right of residency in the United Kingdom in the time preceding the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1985 and later the handover of Hong Kong (then the largest British colony), to the People's Republic of China in 1997. However, persons from Hong Kong had lost the automatic right to live in the United Kingdom in 1962, and the Act did not change the substance of that fact. The act is also seen as a minor factor in precipitating the Falklands War, as Argentina apparently saw the move as a sign of disengagement of the United Kingdom from its Falklands dependency. After the war, full British citizenship was granted to the Falkland Islanders. Other criticisms were levelled at the time at the removal of the automatic right to citizenship by birth in the United Kingdom. However, because UK-born children of permanent residents are automatically British, the number of non-British children born in the United Kingdom is relatively small. Special provisions made in the Act (for those who do not have another nationality and for those who lived a long time in the United Kingdom) meant there is little pressure for any change to the current law. Similar legislation has been enacted in Australia (1986), the Republic of Ireland (2005) and New Zealand (2006). "
wikipedia-1256823," Giovanna of Italy  Joanna of Italy (, ) (13 November 1907 – 26 February 2000) was the last Tsaritsa of Bulgaria. Childhood. Giovanna was born in Rome, the third daughter and fourth child of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro. She was raised in the Villa Savoia and from a young age was aware of her aim in life: to further the House of Savoy's dynastic aspirations through marriage. Upon her christening into the Catholic faith, she was given the names Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria. Her older brother was the future Italian king Umberto II of Italy. Marriage and children. Although it would eventually prove to be of no assistance to Italy, Giovanna duly married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria in Assisi in October 1930, in a Roman Catholic ceremony, attended by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Bulgarians deemed her a good match, partly because of her mother's native Slavic ethnicity. At a second ceremony in Sofia, Bulgaria, Giovanna (who herself was daughter of a Roman Catholic father and a born Orthodox mother) was married in an Eastern Orthodox Church ceremony, bringing her into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. Giovanna adopted the Bulgarian version of her name, Ioanna. Giovanna knew the Pope's Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria, Archbishop Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII who was able to help her. She and Boris had two children: Marie Louise of Bulgaria, born in January 1933, and then the future Simeon II of Bulgaria in 1937. In the years prior to World War II, Tsaritsa Ioanna became heavily involved in charities, including the financing of a children's hospital. During the war she counterbalanced her husband consigning Bulgaria to the Axis by obtaining transit visas to enable a number of Jews to escape to Argentina. Tsar Boris also proved less malleable than Hitler had hoped, and following a meeting in Berlin in August 1943, the Tsar became seriously ill and died, aged 49. While stress and a heart condition were the official reasons for his death, rumours that he had been poisoned by Hitler were voiced at the time and have since grown. Ioanna's son, Simeon, became the new Tsar and a regency was established led by his uncle Prince Kyril, who was considered more pliable by the Germans. Late Years. In the dying days of World War II, Bulgaria was invaded by the Soviet Union. Prince Kyril was tried by a People's Court and subsequently executed. Giovanna and Simeon remained under home arrest at Vrana Palace, near Sofia until 1946, when the new Communist government gave them 48 hours to leave the country. After initially fleeing to Alexandria, Egypt, to be with her father, Vittorio Emmanuele III, they moved to Madrid. After the marriage of Simeon II to the Spanish noblewoman Margarita Gómez-Acebo y Cejuela (a distant relative of the present Spanish King's late brother-in-law) in 1962, Tsaritsa Ioanna moved to Estoril, Portugal, where she lived for the rest of her life, excepting a brief return to Bulgaria in 1993 when she visited Boris's grave. During this last visit to Bulgaria she received a most cordial welcome and thousands of people went on the streets to greet her. She is buried in Assisi, Italy, where she married King Boris III in 1930. "

Playing career. McQueen was a goalkeeper as a schoolboy, but later switched to centre back. He was signed at the age of 18 by St. Mirren. He soon had scouts from other clubs monitoring his progress, and it was Leeds who finally offered £30,000 in 1973, seeing him as a long-term replacement for the ageing Jack Charlton. Charlton played for some of the 1973 season, but had decided to quit as it drew to a close. McQueen played six times in his first season at Leeds but missed out on the 1973 FA Cup Final, with manager Don Revie preferring the experience of utility player Paul Madeley. With Charlton gone and Madeley used as the team's player-of-all-positions, McQueen was in the team for most of the 1973–74 season. Leeds won the league championship, going 29 games without defeat at the start of the season, and McQueen played a crucial part as Norman Hunter's defensive partner. At the end of the season, McQueen was called up to the Scotland squad and made his international debut against Belgium. McQueen and Hunter excelled at the back the following season, notably in Leeds' campaign in the European Cup, during which McQueen scored three goals. McQueen was suspended for the final after being sent off in the semi-final against Barcelona. Leeds lost 2–0 in the final to Bayern Munich. McQueen was now a regular for Scotland; he was in the 1978 FIFA World Cup squad in Argentina but did not play due to injury. He played his last match for Scotland in 1981, attaining 30 caps and scoring 5 goals for his country. In February 1978, McQueen moved from Leeds to rivals Manchester United for £495,000. On signing he famously stated that '99% of players want to play for Manchester United and the rest are liars'. McQueen helped Manchester United reach the 1979 FA Cup Final, scoring a late goal as Manchester United came back from 2–0 down against Arsenal to level the scores (his 85th minute goal cutting the deficit to 2–1), only for their opponents to wrestle the Cup back with a last-minute winner. McQueen finally gained an FA Cup winner's medal in 1983 after a replay against Brighton & Hove Albion. He also was in the team which lost the League Cup final to Liverpool in the same season. McQueen finally left Manchester United in 1985, after losing his first team place to Paul McGrath and not being included in the 1985 FA Cup Final side that beat Everton 1–0. Post playing career. He coached abroad and then briefly managed Airdrieonians and coached his old club, St Mirren. When McQueen's friend and former team-mate Bryan Robson became manager of Middlesbrough, McQueen joined him as reserve team coach. He left the club when Robson did, and became a pundit for Sky Sports. It was announced on 29 April 2008 that he returned to Middlesbrough as an assistant scout, along with Boro legend David Mills. McQueen, who still lives in the area, specifically the village of Hutton Rudby in North Yorkshire, and his son and two daughters, who are also Middlesbrough fans. Personal life. He became a father in 1979 to Hayley McQueen, who would become a sports journalist on Sky Sports and Manchester United's in-house TV channel MUTV. His other daughter, Anna McQueen works for digital experience creation agency, Delete in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

wikipedia-1256880," Hala'ib Triangle  The Halayeb Triangle (also spelled ""Hala'ib ""; """" ) is an area of land measuring located on the Red Sea's African coast. The area, which takes its name from the town of Hala'ib, is created by the difference in the Egypt–Sudan border between the ""political boundary"" set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the ""administrative boundary"" set by the British in 1902, which gave administrative responsibility for an area of land north of the line to Sudan, which was an Anglo-Egyptian client at the time. With the independence of Sudan in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. Since the mid-1990s, Egypt has exercised ""de facto"" effective administration of the area as part of the Red Sea Governorate, following the deployment of Egyptian military units there in the 1990s, and has been actively investing in it.  The description of the area as a ""triangle"" is a rough generalization. Only the southern demarcation, which follows latitude 22, is a straight line. While the whole area is north of the 22 degree line, a smaller area south of latitude 22, referred to as Bir Tawil, joins the Hala'ib Triangle at its westernmost point along the latitude line – neither Sudan nor Egypt claim Bir Tawil. The area is sometimes referred to in Egypt as the ""Sudan Government Administration Area"" or SGAA. History. In 1899, when the United Kingdom held hegemony in the area, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the political boundary between the territories at the 22nd parallel. However, in 1902 the British drew a separate ""administrative boundary,"" which assigned administration of the territory of the Ababda tribe south of the 22-degree latitude line to Egypt, and gave the Sudan the grazing land of the Beja tribe north of the line to administer. The Sudan-administered territory comprised about 18,000 km2, including the towns of Hala'ib, Shalatin and Abu Ramad. When Sudan became independent in 1956, Egypt regarded the latitude 22 territorial boundary of 1899 as the border between the two countries, while Sudan held to the claimed 1902 administrative boundary. As a result, both Egypt and Sudan claim sovereignty over the territory. Conversely, the area south of the line which had been administered by Egypt, Bir Tawil, is a ""terra nullius"", claimed by neither country. In February 1958, two years after Sudanese independence, with Sudan planning to hold elections in the Triangle, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt sent troops into the disputed region for the referendum of the proposed unification between Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic. but withdrew them the same month. Although both countries continued to lay claim to the land, joint control of the area remained in effect until 1992, when Egypt objected to Sudan’s granting of exploration rights for the waters off the Triangle to a Canadian oil company. Negotiations began, but the company pulled out of the deal until sovereignty was settled. In July 1994, Sudan sent memoranda to the United Nations Security Council, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab League complaining about what it claimed was more than 39 military and administrative incursions by Egypt into Sudanese territory since Sudan had last filed memoranda in May 1993. In January 1995 Egypt rejected a Sudanese request for the OAU Foreign Ministers' Council to review the dispute at their meeting in Addis Ababa. Then, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak when he arrived in Addis Ababa to attend the meeting, Egypt accused Sudan of complicity, and, among other responses, strengthened its control of the Hala'ib triangle, expelling Sudanese police and other officials. In 1998, relations between Egypt and Sudan bettered somewhat, and the countries announced their intention to work together to resolve the Hala'ib Triangle dispute, with increased cooperation between their security forces. Later that year, though, Sudan accused Egypt of harassing Sudanese citizens in the area, a charge which Egypt denied. Nevertheless, by March 1999, the countries were in diplomatic discussions aimed at improving relations between them. During a visit to Egypt by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in December 1999, a joint communique was issued pledging to solve the Hala'ib dispute ""in an integrational brotherly context..."" In January 2000, Sudan withdrew its forces from the area, effectively ceding control of the border zone to Egypt, whose forces have occupied and administered the area since. Recent events. In 2004 Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir claimed that despite his nation's withdrawal in 2000, and Egypt's ""de facto"" control of the Triangle, the area still rightfully belonged to Sudan which had ""never relinquished"" it. ""We did not make any concessions... The proof is that we have recently renewed the complaint to the Security Council,"" he said, according to the Press. Al-Bashir reiterated the Sudanese claim of sovereignty over Hala'ib in a 2010 speech in Port Sudan, saying ""Hala'ib is Sudanese and will always be Sudanese."" The Eastern Front, a Sudanese politico-military coalition comprising the Beja Congress and Free Lions that recently signed a peace agreement with Khartoum, has stated that it considers Hala'ib to be part of Sudan due its population being ethnically, linguistically and tribally connected to that country. The head of the Eastern Front and Beja Congress, Musa Muhammad Ahmad, has declared that the issue of Hala'ib's sovereignty should be decided by international arbitration in a similar manner to the issue of sovereignty over Abyei between Northern and Southern Sudan. In October 2009 the Electoral Commission that prepared a comprehensive plan for Sudan's general elections in April 2010 declared that Hala'ib was one of the Red Sea State electoral districts and that its people should exercise their constitutional rights and register in order to participate in the general elections. Voter registration did not take place in the Hala'ib Triangle area because the team from the Sudanese election commission was refused entry by Egyptian authorities. In December 2009, the Sudanese presidential assistant Musa Mohamed Ahmed was barred from entering the border area. Ahmed's visit was intended to ""assert sovereignty over the [Hala'ib triangle and inspect the situation of the people and provide moral and financial support to the members of the Sudanese army unit trapped inside since the occupation began."" His remarks were the first official recognition that Sudanese Army personnel remained inside the area of ""de facto"" Egyptian control. Ahmed also asserted that the Hal'ib Triangle is Sudanese and would not be forsaken ""under any circumstances.""  The government of Egypt is taking steps to close the Egyptian-Sudanese trade center of Alshalateen and move it to the border control pass point on the 22nd parallel, which has had its facilities enlarged and its administrative manpower increased to handle the Egyptian-Sudanese land trade. By doing this, trucks bringing goods to Egypt from Sudan will not be allowed to unload their goods in Alshalateen, as in the past, but instead at the Hadarba border pass point. Wadi Halfa is another border pass point west of the Nile River at 22 degrees north. As of 2009 the Egyptian electricity authority is building a line to supply the city of Alshalateen with electric power from the main Egyptian grid to replace the generators presently in use there. This line will extend in the future to Abu Ramad and Hala'ib. Since May 2010 a new paved road connects the triangle to Port Sudan. It was reported in the Sudanese daily ""Al-Ahram Today"" on 22 April 2010 that Al-Taher Muhammad Hasaay, the former head of the Hala'ib Council and a member of the Bisharin tribe who was campaigning against the Egyptian military presence in the Hala'ib triangle, died in a hospital in Cairo after having been detained by Egyptian security forces without trial for two years. A delegation of the Bisharin tribe stated to the Sudan Media Centre that seven of their members were also in detention: Muhammad Eissa Saeed, who has been in custody for 6 years, Ali Eissa Abu Eissa and Muhammad Saleem, detained for 5 years, and Hashim Othman, Muhammad Hussein AbdalHakam, Karrar Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Tahir Muhammad Saleh each in holding for 2 years. In July 2010, it was reported in the Egyptian newspaper ""Al-Masry Al-Youm"" that the chiefs of three tribes in the Hala'ib triangle – el-Ababda, el-Basharya and el-Beja – supported the Egyptian claims for the area, stating that they are Egyptian and not Sudanese citizens, and that they have all the rights of Egyptian citizens, including national identity cards, the right to vote in elections and to serve in the Egyptian military. On November 29, 2010, an open letter was sent to the President of Sudan by Muhammad Al-Hassan Okair (Toyota) who had been the parliamentary member of Hala'ib in 1995, from Hala'ib itself. The letter was written on behalf of the Bisharin, Hamad-Orab and Aliyaab tribes and complained of the forced inclusion of 20 villages that had been administered under indigenous civil society structures into 2 Egyptian electoral districts. The letter further complained of the siege of Hala'ib, the fact that its inhabitants live within barbed wire and that anything from Sudan is refused entry on the premise that Hala'ib is Egyptian and that the tribes' camels are not allowed to travel and graze for pasture in the ancestral lands of the Bisharin from Hala'ib to the neighbouring River Nile (state) in Sudan. Settlements. The major town in the area is Abu Ramad which lies north west of Hala'ib on the Red Sea coast. Abu Ramad is the last destination of the buses that connect the area to Cairo and the other cities of Egypt such as Aswan, Marsa Alam and Qena. The only other populated place is the small village of Hadarba, south east of Hala'ib town on the coast. Alshalateen is an Egyptian town just on the northern administrative boundary. The closest Sudanese town south of the disputed area is Osief (Marsa Osief), located south of latitude 22, the political border line claimed by Egypt based on the 1899 agreement. Ecology and geography.

wikipedia-1256913," Tom Savini  Thomas Vincent ""Tom"" Savini (born November 3, 1946) is an American actor, stuntman, director, and award-winning special effects and makeup artist. He is known for his makeup and special effects work on many films directed by George A. Romero, including ""Martin"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Creepshow"" and ""Monkey Shines""; he also created the special effects and makeup for many cult classics like ""Friday the 13th"" (parts I and IV), ""Maniac"", ""The Burning"", ""The Prowler"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". Savini directed ""Night of the Living Dead"", the 1990 remake of Romero's 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead""; his other directing work include three episodes of the TV show ""Tales from the Darkside"" and one segment in ""The Theatre Bizarre"". As an actor and stuntman, he has appeared in films such as ""Martin"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Knightriders"", ""From Dusk till Dawn"", ""Planet Terror"", ""Machete"", and ""Machete Kills"". Early life. Savini was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is of Italian descent. He was raised in the Catholic religion and graduated from Central Catholic High School. As a boy, his inspiration was actor Lon Chaney, Sr., and Savini attributes his earliest desires to create makeup effects to Chaney and the film ""Man of a Thousand Faces"". Experimenting with whatever medium he could find, the young Savini practiced creating makeup effects on himself, later convincing his friends to let him practice his craft on them. He also discovered another passion, acting. Combining his makeup applications and homemade costumes, he especially enjoyed scaring his friends. Savini attended Point Park University for three years, before enlisiting in the United States Army. He appeared in stage productions throughout college and continued on stage after his tour of duty in Vietnam. Savini served as a combat photographer during the Vietnam War. He continued to practice with makeup in Vietnam, often frightening indigenous peasants by appearing to suddenly transform into a ""monster"". Using the lens of his camera, Savini separated himself from the real life horrors of war; however, all the images still haunted his mind. Savini said his wartime experiences influenced his eventual style of gory effects: ""I hated that when I watched a war movie and someone dies. Some people die with one eye open and one eye half-closed, sometimes people die with smiles on their faces because the jaw is always slack. I incorporated the feeling of the stuff I saw in Vietnam into my work."" In 1970, while on guard duty, a flare was triggered in the jungle area Savini was watching. Against military protocol, Savini fired into the bush without informing his superiors. Other soldiers likewise began firing until a duck wandered from the bush completely unharmed. Due to his failure to follow orders, Savini was taken off guard duty from his bunker on the following evening. That same evening, the bunker came under attack and several soldiers were wounded or killed. As a result of this incident, Savini earned the nickname ""Duck Slayer"" and to this day will not eat duck. After his tour in Vietnam, he attended Carnegie-Mellon University, as the first undergraduate to be awarded a full fellowship in the acting and directing program. Among the many talents Savini achieved as a young man was the art of fencing. Much of his stunt work and some of his characters reflect these graceful abilities; however, he is also accomplished with a bull whip and many of his characters have been bikers or madmen who are hardened and eerily evil. Career. Savini is primarily known for his groundbreaking work in the field of special makeup effects, His signature realism livens otherwise plodding genre films. Early in Savini's career, Dick Smith became an inspiration and a guide, later becoming an associate at Savini's Special Make-up Effects Program. Among other projects, Smith is known for his groundbreaking work in ""The Exorcist"". Savini got his breakthrough working with Pittsburgh filmmaker George A. Romero, providing a convincing wrist slashing effect in the opening scenes of ""Martin"" (1977). The following year, working with an larger budget on ""Dawn of the Dead"", Savini created his signature palette of severed limbs and bite-marks. In the 1980 slasher film ""Friday the 13th"", Savini expanded his repertoire of blood and gore. He continued to perfect those techniques in another film that year, ""Maniac"". Along with the 1981 films ""The Burning"" and ""The Prowler"", Savini earned the nickname ""The Sultan of Splatter"". In 1982, he created more traditional horror effects in the film ""Creepshow"" directed by George A. Romero and written by Stephen King. In 1984, he agreed to work on """", where he killed his creation Jason Voorhees. Returning to the zombie genre in 1985, Savini was nominated and won the 1985 Saturn Award for Best Makeup Effects for his work on the Romero's ""Day of the Dead"". In 1986, Savini worked with director Tobe Hooper on the film ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". Savini has also worked on films by Italian director Dario Argento, first in 1990 on the film ""Two Evil Eyes"" and again on the 1993 film ""Trauma"". In the 1991 film ""Heartstopper"", he created special effects for director John A. Russo. Although focusing more on his acting career in recent years, Savini has continued to be active with special makeup effects and in 2011 supervised the effects for the Australian film ""Redd Inc"". As an actor, Savini has appeared in many of the same films he was creating effects for. His first appearance was a relatively straight, innocuous character in ""Martin"" in 1977; however, he played a menacing biker called Blades in his next film ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), a role he reprised in zombie form with a cameo appearance in the 2005 continuation of the series, ""Land of the Dead"". In the 1980 film ""Maniac"", his brief role in the film found him facing the maniac's shotgun and having his head blown off in a spectacular display. Savini had a much more prominent role as biker and antagonist Morgan, the Black Knight, in George A. Romero's ""Knightriders"" (1981). Continuing with the biker theme, Savini played the universally recognized, whip-wielding, vampire-fighting biker ""Sex Machine"" in the 1996 Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez film ""From Dusk till Dawn"". (This character was a riff on Blades from ""Dawn of the Dead"" replete with the same costume.) In 2007, Savini took on a role in ""Planet Terror"", one of the two stories in the ""Grindhouse film"", directed by Robert Rodriguez. Savini plays the character of Deputy Tolo who fights to save his town from an infestation of zombie like creatures. In another Rodriguez film, ""Machete"", based on a fake movie trailer played during the Grindhouse film, Savini plays the character of Osiris Amanpour, hired to track and kill the main character, Machete; Rodriguez has planned a return of Savin's character Osiris in the sequel to ""Machete"". Throughout the years, Savini has appeared in movie roles from cameos as the vampire David Van Etten in """", as the sheriff in the 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, or tongue in cheek characters, like Jesus Christ in ""Zombiegeddon"" (2003).

Savini also appeared as one of the Trackers in Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"". Future projects include Savini starring in the Nazi zombie film ""The 4th Reich"" directed by Shaun Robert Smith, playing the role of SS-Standartenführer Oskar Dirlewanger. As a film director, Savini helmed episodes of the syndicated television series ""Tales from the Darkside"", the aforementioned 1990 color remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and, ""House Call"", the pilot of the proposed series ""The Chill Factor"", which starred Pittsburgh actor Bingo O'Malley. In 2011, he directed ""Wet Dreams"", one of six segments to the horror film ""The Theatre Bizarre"". In 2009, Savini announced his plan to direct a new film, ""Death Island"", with special make-up effects by his former protege Greg Nicotero. On September 1, 2013, Savini began a crowd funding project on Indiegogo for ""Death Island"". His plans are to begin filming by the end of 2013. In the 2008 novel ""Bad Moon Rising"" by Jonathan Maberry, Savini appears as one of the real-world horror celebrities who are in the fictional town of Pine Deep when monsters attack; other celebrities include James Gunn, Jim O'Rear, Brinke Stevens, Ken Foree, Stephen Susco, Debbie Rochon, Joe Bob Briggs and blues man Mem Shannon. Savini also briefly took part in Jerry Lawler's 2010 revival of the ""Memphis Wrestling"" pro wrestling television show.

wikipedia-1261437," Franklin Sousley  Franklin Runyon Sousley (September 19, 1925 – March 21, 1945) was a United States Marine who was killed in action during World War II. He is one of the six men in the famous photograph of United States Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima in World War II. Early life. Sousley was born in Hill Top, Kentucky, the second child born to Merle Duke Sousley (1899–1934) and Goldie Mitchell (November 9, 1904 – March 14, 1988). When he was two years old, his five-year-old brother, Malcolm Brooks Sousley (November 24, 1923 – May 30, 1928), died due to appendicitis. Franklin attended a two-room schoolhouse in nearby Elizaville, and attended Fleming County High School in nearby Flemingsburg from ninth to twelfth grade. His younger brother Julian was born in May 1933, and his father died due to diabetes complications a year later, at age 35. At only nine years old, Franklin was the sole male-figure in the family, and assisted his mother in raising Julian. Julian died in a car accident on 4 October 1951, at the age of 18. Sousley graduated from Fleming High School in May 1943, and resided in Dayton, Ohio as a worker in a refrigerator factory. World War II. Sousley received his draft notice, and chose to join the United States Marine Corps on January 5, 1944, and underwent extensive combat training as a member of the Fifth Marine Division.  Sousley landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945, and participated in the battle for the capture of the island. Alongside John Bradley, Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block, and Michael Strank, he assisted in raising a second and larger American flag on Mount Suribachi, on February 23, 1945, an iconic photograph immortalized by Joe Rosenthal.  He was to be returned to Washington, D.C. for a War bond tour with the other five flag raisers after the Marines secured the island. According to """" by Parker Bishop Albee, Jr. and Keller Cushing Freeman, when the word reached Iwo Jima, Sousley was located on a dangerous part of the island, and his company commander, Captain Dave Severance, decided it was safer to leave him where he was than attempt an extrication under the conditions. According to James Bradley's ""Flags of Our Fathers"", on March 21, 1945, PFC Sousley was shot in the back by a Japanese sniper, as he was walking down an open road on the nearly-secured island. A fellow Marine witnessed Sousley lying on the ground and asked, ""How bad are you hit?"" Sousley's reply and last words were reportedly, ""Not bad, I can't feel a thing."" However, Ron Elliott's ""From Hilltop to Mountaintop"" shows an affidavit signed by Rene Gagnon reporting that ""Sousley was killed instantly.""

wikipedia-1261439," Anahuac Disturbances  The Anahuac Disturbances were uprisings of settlers in and around Anahuac, Texas in 1832 and 1835 which helped to precipitate the Texas Revolution. This eventually led to the territory's secession from Mexico and the founding of the Republic of Texas. Anahuac was located on the east side of the Trinity River near the north shore of Galveston Bay, which placed it astride the trade route between Mexico and Louisiana, and from there to the rest of the United States. In new attempts to curtail smuggling and enforce customs tariffs from the coastal settlements, Mexico placed a garrison there after 1830. American settlers came into conflict with Mexican military officers, and rose up against them. They increased political activity and residents of numerous communities declared support for the federalists, who were revolting against the central government. Background. After Mexico gained independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Americans living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830 the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay. In October 1830 Bradburn established a post atop a bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac. Bradburn was unpopular from the beginning of his tenure. He opposed the efforts of the state land commissioner to grant titles to settlers who lived near Anahuac. The Mexican Constitution of 1824 prohibited immigrants from settling within of the coast, and most of these settlers lived too close to the coast. Although the commissioner was finally able to grant the titles, settlers were angry with Bradburn. In January 1832, Bradburn received a letter listing 10 men in his jurisdiction who wanted to separate Texas from Mexico. From that point on, """"Bradburn became increasingly obsessed about the Anglo-Americans and their intentions, believing that every event was part of a conspiracy to detach Texas."""" In June 1832, two of Bradburn's soldiers attacked a female settler. Angry settlers tarred and feathered a neighbor who failed to aid her. They demanded that Bradburn turn over the soldiers for a similar punishment. After Bradburn refused, local men organized a militia, supposedly to protect the settlement from the Indians. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader Patrick Jack. After Bradburn received death threats, he released Jack. 1832 Disturbance. Prelude. Tensions between Bradburn and the colonists escalated. Bradburn strongly supported the Mexican law forbidding slavery. In August 1831 he gave asylum to three men who had escaped slavery in Louisiana. The owner retained local lawyer William Barret Travis to represent him in trying to get the slaves returned. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter, ostensibly from a friend, warning that 100 armed men would come from Louisiana to reclaim the slaves. When Bradburn realized that the letter was a hoax, he arrested Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection to separate the territory from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would lead to Travis's execution. Unfamiliar with Mexican law, the settlers were outraged that Bradburn could arrest the man without a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most assumed they were still covered by the United States Bill of Rights. Jack threatened Bradburn, who arrested him again. Travis and Jack then began plotting their escape. They attempted to smuggle letters to David G. Burnet, a fellow instigator; the letters called on Texians to aid them, but stopped short of calling for armed rebellion. Bradburn intercepted the letters before delivery. Although settlers at first did not get involved, they became alarmed at learning that Bradburn was taking statements from potential witnesses without allowing Travis, Jack, or their legal representation to speak with the witnesses. Jack's brother organized a contingent of men to march from Brazoria to Anahuac. Men began arriving from other villages as well. One of the Brazoria councilmen, John Austin, stopped to consult Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the garrison on the Brazos. Ugartechea recommended that Austin request that the men be remanded into civilian custody. Bradburn's officers explained to Austin and company that the laws prohibited turning the accused men over to civilian authorities. The Brazoria men returned home. After they left, the Mexican officers discovered that their horses had been stolen. They arrested two local men on suspicion of the theft. On hearing of the new arrests, the Brazoria contingent returned to Anahuac. They camped with other angry civilians several miles from Anahuac and elected Frank W. Johnson as commander. The group soon captured Bradburn's nineteen cavalry officers, who had been trying to reconnoiter the Texian position. On June 10, the insurgents occupied buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn worried that the armed men wanted to do more than free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied to the ground with weapons pointed at them. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Texians to Turtle Bayou. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just to get them out of the buildings they had occupied. Unbeknownst to the Texians at the time, the buildings contained extra ammunition and supplies. Battle of Anahuac. After hearing Bradburn's warning, the women and children of Anahuac fled the town. Mexican soldiers briefly engaged the men who remained; five Mexican soldiers and one Texian died in the conflict. After the skirmish, the remaining Texans gathered at Turtle Bayou to await the arrival of cannons coming from Brazoria. On June 13, the Texans adopted the Turtle Bayou Resolutions. In this document, they announced they were federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. They decried ""the present dynasty"" that kept them under military rather than civil authority. While the Texans waited for their artillery, Bradburn appealed for reinforcements from Colonel Piedras, stationed at Nacogdoches north, and Colonel Elosúa at San Antonio, about to the west. On June 19, Piedras and about 100 of his men set out to support Bradburn. John Austin and his men returned to Brazoria for the cannons. On June 20, he called the residents together, and they voted to oppose the centralist government. Austin invited Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the small fort on the Brazos, to join their cause. After Ugartechea refused, on June 26 the Brazoria residents attacked the fort. The action became known as the Battle of Velasco. The next morning, Ugartechea surrendered under an agreement that he and his men would return to Matamoros but leave their artillery behind. When Piedras was within of Anahuac, he sent a delegation to Johnson, who provided him with a list of grievances against Bradburn. Piedras negotiated a resolution of the conflict. Among the measures to which he agreed were: With Texans' acceptance of the terms on June 28, Piedras marched to Anahuac on July 1. Aftermath. Bradburn's chosen successor, Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subarán, refused to take his place. Piedras took temporary command of the garrison. On July 2, he released the prisoners to the civilian authorities; within a week they were released with no charges filed. On July 8, Piedras left for Nacogdoches. He gave command of the Anahuac garrison to Lieutenant Cortina, previously the third-in-command. Three days after Piedras left, the bulk of the Anahuac troops declared themselves federalists. The troops were drunk and Cortina, unable to maintain order, asked Bradburn to resume command. Bradburn refused, instead recommending that Subarán take responsibility. After an attempt at his assassination was forestalled, Bradburn decided to leave Texas. None of the local ship captains would give him passage. On July 13, Subarán announced he would not guarantee the safety of any officers who supported the centralist government. That night, Bradburn left Anahuac; a hired guide took him on foot to Louisiana. Other officers sought sanctuary with sympathetic locals. Historians have discussed Bradburn's role. William C. Davis believes that he ""overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction"". The resulting Turtle Bayou Resolutions, however, encouraged other Texians to follow similar courses. Many communities declared support for Santa Anna. When Piedras returned to Nacogdoches, he discovered citizens were forming militias. He asked the local ""ayuntamiento"" to order the militias to disband; they refused and instead formed their own militia. On August 1, the combined militias ordered Piedras to vow support for the federalist revolt. When he refused, the Texians attacked and the Battle of Nacogdoches commenced. Several days later, they took Piedras and his men prisoner and ""convinced"" them to become federalists. With the soldiers' surrender and retreat into the Mexican interior, no Mexican troops remained in eastern Texas. This encouraged the colonists to increase political activity. Soon after, they organized the Convention of 1832, marking the first attempt to gather Texians from each of the colonies to discuss common goals. 1835 Disturbance. A second dispute arose in late June 1835, again over the issue of customs. Leading up to this crisis, a large amount of Anglo settlers had immigrated into the Anahuac area. The current commander was reported as being uneasy about the insubordinate attitudes of the locals, and he requested additional military assistance from his superiors. Tensions continued to escalate as some citizens demonstrated with anti-taxation protests and petitions. In addition,a group known as the Citizens of Texas began to meet with the intention of realizing these demands. Andrew Briscoe, a local merchant and boat captain as well as a member of this group, complained that taxes were not being enforced equally at all ports. He intentionally tested the new commander, Capt. Antonio Tenorio, by loading his boat in a way to increase curiosity of the officials. Briscoe simply loaded his boat with ballast. Tenorio was incensed and arrested Briscoe and his partner DeWitt Clinton Harris. The soldiers escorting Harris and Briscoe shot and wounded another Texian, young William Smith. Travis played a major role afterward. When news of the arrests were heard in San Felipe de Austin, where radical sentiments were taking hold, the political chief Peter Miller authorized Travis to gather a militia for response. Travis commandeered a vessel at Harrisburg, and sailed for Anahuac with the militia and a cannon. His 25-man force quickly gained surrender of the more than 40 Mexican troops. After disarming them, Travis and the militia freed the Texians and expelled the troops. Because Travis had acted without broad community support, he apologized to avoid endangering Stephen F. Austin, then in Mexico City. Austin was the most prominent empresario under contract by the Spanish, and later Mexican, governments to oversee the immigration of people to Mexico's frontier. Later that summer, Mexican military authorities demanded the surrender of Travis for military trial. The colonists opposed this. Travis and Austin continued active in Texas development. Travis died at the Battle of the Alamo. Austin served as secretary of state for the Republic of Texas for a short time before his own death. "

Fieldy was also working on his own clothing line Immanuel one twenty three; when asked about it while backstage at the West Palm Beach stop of the Mayhem Festival in 2010, he stated that it was ""much harder than he had previously expected"" to start a clothing line, and has moved on to the side project that he can ""be more proud of, opposed to his first solo CD under Fieldy's Dreams titled Rock'n Roll Gangster"" Got The Life: My Journey of Addiction, Faith, Recovery and Korn is a memoir Fieldy penned, which hit shelves March 10, 2009. His autobiography tells the story of how he found God, quit drugs, and found the better part of himself. Fieldy has a tattoo that was done by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst while he still worked in a tattoo parlour. "
wikipedia-1261461," Truck stop  A truck stop, also known as a transport cafe in the United Kingdom and as a travel center by major chains in the United States, is a commercial facility which provides refuelling, rest (parking), and often ready made food and other services to motorists and truck drivers. Truck stops are usually located on or near a busy road. Truck stop services. Smaller truck stops might consist of only a parking area, a fueling station, and perhaps a diner restaurant. Larger truck stops might have convenience stores of various sizes, showers, a small video arcade, and a TV/movie theater (usually just a projector with an attached DVD player). The largest truck stops, like Iowa 80 (the largest in the world), might have several independent businesses operating under one roof, catering to a wide range of travelers' needs, and might have several major and minor fast-food chains operating a small food court. Larger truck stops also tend to have full-service maintenance facilities for heavy trucks, as well as vehicle wash services that can handle anything from passenger vehicles to large trucks. Some truck stops operate motels or have them adjacent. Most truck stops now offer separate fueling areas, often with dedicated entrances, for standard-sized passenger vehicles. The truck refueling area almost always offers dual pumps, one on each side, so large trucks can fill both tanks at once. (The second pump is referred to as the ""slave pump"" or ""satellite pump."") The fuel islands at many truck stops can get very crowded. Most trucking companies have accounts with one or two truck stop chains and, after negotiating a specific price for diesel, require their drivers to fuel exclusively at supported locations. Truck stops near a large city, or on the east or west coasts, suffer from the most congestion at their fuel islands. The retail stores in large truck stops offer a large selection of 12-volt DC products, such as coffee makers, TV/VCR combos, toaster ovens, and frying pans primarily targeted towards truck drivers, who often spend extended periods of time on the road. Such shops generally offer a wide selection of maps, road atlases, truck stop and freeway exit guides, truck accessories (such as CB radio equipment and hazmat placards), plus entertainment media such as movies, video games, music, and audio books. Increasingly, as interstate truck drivers have become a large market for satellite radio, these retail stores also sell various satellite radio receivers for both XM and Sirius as well as subscriptions to those services. Kiosks run by cellular phone providers are also common. Most long-haul tractors have sleeping berths, and many truck drivers keep their diesel engines running for heating or cooling for the sake of comfort. Because idling diesel engines make considerable noise (and are a source of pollution) they are often banned from such use near residential areas. Truck stops (along with public rest stops) are the main places where truck drivers may rest peacefully, as required by regulations. Modern innovations, such as truck heaters and auxiliary power units, are becoming more common, and some truck stops now provide power, air conditioning, and communications through systems such as IdleAire. Many truck stops have load board monitors for truck drivers to find real time information on loads, jobs, weather and news. Most chain truck stops also have WLAN Internet access in their parking areas. Idle reduction — reducing the amount of fuel consumed by truck fleets during idling — is an ongoing economical and environmental effort. [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/toolbox/pdfs/idleaire_webcast_26jul07.pdf] United States. The truck stop originated in the United States in the 1940s as a reliable source of diesel fuel not commonly available at filling stations. This, coupled with the growth of the Interstate Highway System, led to the creation of the professional haulage and truck stop industries. They generally consist of, at the very least, a diesel grade fueling station with bays wide and tall enough for modern tractor/trailer rigs, plus a large enough parking area to accommodate from five to over a hundred trucks and other heavy vehicles. Truck stops should not be confused with rest areas or motorway service areas which cater mostly to cars and are often run by or leased from a government or tollway corporation.  In the United States in the late 1990s, Truckstops of America (T/A) changed its name to TravelCenters of America to reflect this marketing strategy. There is no exact distinction between ""truck stop"" and the newer term ""travel center"", but some differences are size, proximity to interstate highways and major roads, the number of services, accessibility to automotive and RV travelers, and a certain extra emphasis on facility appearance. Many truck stops chains such as Flying J and T/A also serve the recreational vehicle market. All the national chains have established customer loyalty programs to promote repeated patronage. Truck stops were often depicted in films and novels as being somewhat seedy places, frequented by aggressive bikers, petty criminals, and prostitutes (e.g. the "" lot lizards"" in the JT LeRoy novel Sarah). This might be an outdated stereotype, as most modern truck stops are generally clean and safe, becoming a ""home away from home"" for many truck drivers. However, most truck stops reflect the social environment of their local area; consequently, one occasionally finds seedy truck stops in seedy areas. According to John McPhee's book ""Uncommon Carriers"", truck stops in rural areas are typically very safe and wholesome. However, as the distance to major cities decrease the incidence of prostitution, drug peddling etc increases dramatically. The Vince Lombardi service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near New York City has the most rampant prostitution. Australia. In Australia, most truck stops - usually known as roadhouses, as they provide services to cars as well as trucks - are owned by, or are franchises of, oil companies such as Castrol and BP, but can include other franchises like McDonalds. United Kingdom. In the UK the term ""truck stop"" is not in common use and the equivalent stops are either transport cafes signposted simply as ""Services"", including many similar features to truck stops but also frequented by the majority of motorway traffic. They often include overnight accommodations, places to eat and newsagents. Germany and Austria. In Germany and some parts of Austria, a recent development has seen a new kind of Autobahn service stations apart from the highway itself. The often state owned service stations at the highway were insufficient to deal with the growing number of lorries and the necessary stops for lorry drivers to rest. Since 2001, the traffic regulations of Germany ""Straßenverkehrsordnung"" include a road sign, ""Autohof"", literally ""car yard"" or ""automobile court"". An Autohof is run by a private company, but the government provides the road signs at the highway, indicating an Autohof, if the facility: Corporatization. The economics of truck stops have driven most of the small, post-war operations out of business and they have been replaced with large corporate chains or franchises. Truck drivers are a captive market, because the trucks' size and local regulations place severe restrictions on where a truck driver can park. The initial investment in land, permits, equipment and maintenance requirements are large and growing: accordingly, some large truck stop chains have begun to cater to a wider range of the traveling public by combining trucks stops and traditional gas stations.

wikipedia-1261480," Powder River Basin  The Powder River Basin is a geologic structural basin in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, about east to west and north to south, known for its coal deposits. The region supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. It is both a topographic drainage and geologic structural basin. The basin is so named because it is drained by the Powder River, although it is also drained in part by the Cheyenne River, Tongue River, Bighorn River, Little Missouri River, Platte River, and their tributaries. While the Powder River Basin is unified geologically, residents of areas distant from the Powder River proper do not think of themselves as living in a single geographic region. For example, residents of the Crow Reservation in the Big Horn River watershed, or of Sheridan in the Tongue River watershed, would locate the Powder River Basin as the region east of the Big Horn Mountains, using a definition based on watershed and topography. Major cities in the area include Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming and Miles City, Montana. Outside of these main towns, the area is very sparsely populated and is known for its rolling grasslands and semiarid climate. It is the single largest source of coal mined in the United States, and contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world. Most of the active coal mining in the Powder River Basin actually takes place in drainages of the Cheyenne River. Because of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming has been the top coal-producing state in the United States since 1988. In 2007, the Powder River Basin alone produced 436 million short tons (396 million tonnes) of coal, more than twice the production of second-place West Virginia, and more than the entire Appalachian region. The Powder River Basin is the largest coal producing region in the United States. The Black Thunder Coal Mine is one of the most productive coal mines in the United States; in 2006 this single mine produced 84 million metric tons of coal, more than any state except Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The region is also a major producer of natural gas through a process called coal-bed methane extraction. Underground coal seams are dewatered through pumping, which reduces pressure and releases trapped gases up to the well head. Geologic history. The Powder River Basin contains a section of Phanerozoic rocks up to thick, from Cambrian to Holocene. Cretaceous. The thickest section of the Powder River Basin is composed of Cretaceous rocks, an overall regressive sequence of mostly marine shales and sandstones deposited in the Western Interior Seaway. Tertiary. The coal beds of the region began to form about 60 million years ago when the land began rising from a shallow sea. The rise of the Black Hills uplift on the east and the Hartville uplift on the southeast side of the basin created the present outline of the Powder River Basin. When the coal beds were forming, the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging about of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the basin floor was covered with lakes and swamps. Because of the large area of the swamps, the organic material accumulated into peat bogs instead of being washed to the sea. Periodically the layers of peat were covered with sediments washed in from nearby mountains. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The basin filled with sediment and buried the peat under thousands of feet, compressing the layers of peat and forming coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, leaving the coal seams near the surface. Coal. Powder River Basin coal is classified as ""sub-bituminous"" and contains an average of approximately 8,500 btu/lb, with low SO2. Contrast this with eastern, Appalachian bituminous coal containing an average of 12,500 btu/lb and high SO2. PRB coal was essentially worthless until air pollution emissions from power plants became a concern. A coal-fired plant designed to burn Appalachian coal must be modified to remove SO2 at a cost estimated in 1999 to be around $113 per ton of SO2 removal if it switches to burning PRB coal, and $322 per ton of SO2 removal by installing scrubbers. The Powder River Basin is the largest coal mining region in the United States, but most of the coal is buried too deeply to be economically accessible. The Powder River Basin coal beds are shaped like elongated bowls and as mines expand from east to west in the Powder River Basin, they will be going ""down the sides of the bowl."" This means that the overburden (rock lying over the coal) will increase as will the stripping ratio (the ratio of rock that needs to be moved to get to a ton of coal). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted a series of studies on the economic accessibility of coal in the major coal producing regions of the country. The studies have typically found that only a small fraction of the coal will be economically accessible at the current price of $10.47/ton. In August 2008, the USGS issued an updated assessment of coal in the Powder River Basin. After considering stripping ratios and production costs, the USGS concluded that at the time of the economic evaluation, only 6 percent of the original resource, or 10.1 billion short tons of coal, was currently economically recoverable. At a price of $60/ton, roughly half (48%) of the coal is economic to produce. Presently the approximately 15 mines in the Powder River Basin are working in areas where the stripping ratio is between 1:1 (i.e. one ton of rock for one ton of coal) and 3:1. As the mines expand the stripping ratio will increase. As more rock needs to be moved (using large electrically powered draglines and diesel and electric mining trucks) the production cost will also increase. The United States uses about 1 billion tons of coal a year, with about 40 percent of the coal currently coming from the Powder River Basin. The amount of coal coming from the Powder River Basin has been increasing over the last 20 years. Increasing the price paid for coal can increase the amount of economically recoverable coal, but increasing the price of coal will also increase the production cost for the coal. In addition, because coal is a solid, not a liquid, it cannot be produced from many scattered wells as oil and gas can be. Rather, coal has to be produced from mines that expand slowly by moving massive quantities of overburden. The mines in the Powder River Basin typically have less than 20 years of life remaining. Almost all of the coal in the Powder River Basin is federally owned and further mine expansions will require a series of federal and state approvals, as well as large investments in additional mine equipment to begin the excavations. The majority of the coal mined in the Powder River Basin is part of the Fort Union Formation (Paleocene), with the low sulfur and ash content of the coal in the region making it very desirable. Coal supplies about half of the United States' electricity supplies, with the Powder River Basin mines supplying around 40 percent of the coal that fuels those stations, mainly to the east of the Rocky Mountains, for generating electricity. As of 2013 five coal export terminals were being proposed in the Pacific Northwest to export coal from the Powder River Basin to China and other Asian markets. Coal mining companies currently operating in the Powder River Basin. Southern Powder River Basin Northern Powder River Basin Petroleum. The Powder River Basin also contains major deposits of petroleum, including the giant Salt Creek Oil Field. The oil and gas are produced from rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Tertiary, but most comes from sandstones in the thick section of Cretaceous rocks.  The Bell Creek Field is a Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic trap in the Muddy Sandstone. Discovered in 1967 by the Exeter Drilling Co. No. 33-1 Federal-McCarrell well, which found 27 feet of pay at a depth of 4500 ft. Coalbed methane. Recent controversy surrounds the extensive coalbed methane extraction in the region. In the last decade, nearly 7000 such wells have been drilled. An extensive network of gas pipeplines connecting these wells has been built, along with a series of pressurization plants, as well as power lines to provide electricity to operate the system. In addition, thousands of miles of new access roads have been constructed. Extracting the gas requires that water be pumped to the surface to release gas trapped in the coal seam. While some of the water is successfully utilized in agriculture production such as livestock water and crop irrigation, some waters are naturally high in salinity and sodium adsorption ratio. There has been controversy on how to best manage these saline waters. In 2007, Powder River Basin coalbed field produced 442 billion cubic feet of gas, making the field the 3rd largest source of natural gas in the United States. Uranium. The region also contains major deposits of uranium, contained in sandstones. (See ""Uranium mining in Wyoming""). The Wasatch Formation (Eocene) contains the uranium ore ""roll front"" type deposits found in the Pumpkin Buttes District. Cameco Corporation subsidiary Power Resources Inc. operates uranium mines in the basin. Transportation. In Spring 2005, coal extracted from the mines would retail at the mines for around $5 a ton. However, power stations and plants in the eastern United States were paying over $30 a ton – the difference caused by the cost of transportation. (In October 2008, the mine-mouth price of Powder River Basin coal was closer to $15 per ton.) To transport coal from the basin, there is a joint railway line owned by the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad running the length of the southern section of the Powder River Basin, including the climb over Crawford Hill, Nebraska. A third railroad, the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, faced strong resistance from many parties for its attempts to extend its rail line into the coal mining area, but while the plan was eventually approved by regulating authorities, the project was abandoned after the railroad was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway. History. Originally a single track Burlington Northern Railway line built in stages from 1972 to 1979, the rail line ran south from Donkey Junction in the north to Caballo, Wyoming; and then for to Shawnee in Converse County. The Chicago and North Western Railway ran close to the northern section, as did the Union Pacific at Caballo. Having already formed the Western Railroad to distribute the coal, in 1982 C&NW and the UP formed Western Railroad Properties, Inc. (WRPI), to acquire half interest in the Burlington Northern coal line from Shawnee Junction to Coal Creek Junction. On December 15, 1986 WPRI purchased more of BN line from Coal Creek Junction to East Caballo Junction. Beginning June 27, 1983 WPRI constructed six miles (10 km) of new railroad from Shawnee Junction. to Shawnee, rebuilt of C&NW line from Shawnee to Crandall and of new railroad from Crandall to Joyce, Nebraska. The first commercial train ran on August 16, 1984. By 1985, the line was single track for almost its entire length, and it was handling 19 million tons of coal. The implementation of the second stage of the Clean Air Act (1990) caused demand for clean coal to rise quickly. The C&NW struggled to upgrade capacity to dual track, resulting in numerous failures on the line in 1994, and eventually Union Pacific's purchase of C&NW in 1995. The UP spent 855 million dollars over the next five years expanding capacity over its entire network to handle coal shipments from the PRB. By 2005 the Joint Line capacity had grown to handle an all-time record 325 million tons, and was either dual or three track capacity for its entire length. Due to various trackage and locomotive failures on the Joint Line in late 2004 and early 2005, the line failed to deliver the amount of contracted coal supplies, and electricity rates increased by 15 percent. Coal customers threatened to evaluate alternate sources of energy and transportation, including the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation. As a result, the expansion of the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad line was approved by the Surface Transportation Board. In 2006 UP and BNSF announced a $100 million investment to provide three track capacity for the entire length of the Joint Line plus a fourth track added over the steepest sections, including Logan Hill. These improvements will enable the Joint Line to handle over 400 million tons of coal. Presently more than eighty train loads of coal, which vary in size from 125 to 150 cars, are shipped from southern PRB mines each day. In 2006, Union Pacific set a record by hauling 194 million tons of coal – an 8% increase compared with 2005 tonnage. The company achieved this by increasing train size, with trains averaging more than 15,000 tons, a 200-ton weight increase compared with fourth-quarter 2005’s average. According to the BNSF 2008 Annual Report, the quadruple track project was completed. In 2009, the America’s Power Factuality Tour stopped at the Powder River Basin to report on its role in generating electricity in the US. "
wikipedia-1261502," Turtle Bayou Resolutions  The Turtle Bayou Resolutions were signed by settlers during the Anahuac Disturbances, which played a role in the secession of Texas from Mexico and the creation of the Republic of Texas. Background. On June 13, 1832, Anglo-American settlers were involved in a conflict with Mexican commander John Davis Bradburn at the posting of Anahuac, Texas, near the north extent of Galveston Bay. The settlers were opposed to control of their daily affairs by the centralist government. They were primarily at odds with the administration over the subject of tariffs on imports/exports and also over the presence of conscripted criminals in the Mexican garrison, whom the colonists blamed for a number of local crimes. The simmering conflict reached a head when Bradburn took in two escaped slaves from Louisiana. Though slavery was officially illegal in Mexico at the time, the Mexican authorities wanted to encourage Anglo-American colonization of the frontier and generally ignored the presence of black indentured servants among the colonists. Two local lawyers, William B. Travis and Patrick C. Jack, attempted to secure the release of these slaves and were arrested by Bradburn. The Anglo militia skirmished with Bradburn's troops before retreating north to the crossing on Turtle Bayou near James Taylor White's ranch house to await the arrival of artillery. The settlers received word that the anti-administration Federalist army had won a significant victory under the leadership of Antonio López de Santa Anna. Colonists react. Taking advantage of this favorable news, they verbally aligned themselves with the Federalist cause by composing the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, which explained their attack against the Centralist troops at Anahuac. They explained that they were not lawless Anglos attacking a Mexican garrison, but that they were Federalist sympathizers opposing a Centralist commandant as part of the civil war that had been in progress for two years between the Centralist administration of Anastasio Bustamante and those wanting to return to the Federalist Constitution of 1824. The four resolutions condemned violations of the 1824 constitution by the Bustamante government and urged all Texans to support the patriots fighting under Santa Anna, who was at the time struggling to defeat military despotism. Though opinions varied among the colonists, few Texans were at that time willing to urge secession. Federalist colonel José Antonio Mexía arrived in Brazoria, Texas, on July 16, 1832, with 400 troops and five ships to quell a supposed movement to sever Texas from Mexico. A copy of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions was included in the seven-point statement of causes for taking up arms that was presented to Mexía on July 18. The explanations offered by the Texas leaders satisfied the Federalist general, and he returned to the Rio Grande. The document. No signatures are affixed to the extant copy of the resolutions themselves, but seven of the Texas leaders (Wyly Martin, John Austin, Luke Lesassier, William H. Jack, Hugh B. Johnston, Francis W. Johnson, and Robert M. Williamson) signed the combined document presented to Mexía. The document was published in an extra edition of the Brazoria ""Constitutional Advocate"" on July 23, 1832, and appeared in Mary Austin Holley's ""Texas"" (1833). Text of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions  ""First: By their repeated violations of the constitution and laws and the total disregard of the civil and political rights of the people. ""Second: Jose G Granado fixing and establishing among us, in the time of peace, military posts, the officers of which, totally disregarding the local civil authorities of the State, have committed various acts evincing opposition to the true interest of the people in the enjoyment of civil liberty. ""Third: By arresting the commissioners, especially Juan Francisco Madero, who, on the part of the State government, was to put the inhabitants east of Trinity River in possession of other lands, in conformity with the laws of colonization. ""Fourth: By the imposition of military force, preventing the Alcalde of the jurisdiction of Liberty from the exercise of his constitutional functions. ""Fifth: By appointing to the revenue department of Galveston, a man whose character for infamy had been clearly established, and made known to the Government, and whose principles are avowedly to the true interest of the people of Texas; and that, too, when their character for infamy had been repeatedly established. ""Sixth: By the military commandant of Anahuac advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same. ""Seventh: By imprisonment of our citizens without lawful cause; and claiming the right of trying said citizens by a military court for offense of a character cognizable by the civil authority alone. ""RESOLVED That we view with feelings of the deepest regret, Tori Tercero manner in which the Government of the Republic of Mexico is administered by the present dynasty - The repeated violations of the constitution - the total disregard for the law - the entire prostration of the civil authority; and the substitution in the stead of military despotism, are grievances of such a character, as to arouse the feelings of every freeman, and impel him to resistance. ""RESOLVED That we view with feelings of deepest interest and solicitude, the firm and manly resistance which is made by those patriots under the highly and distinguished chieftain Santa Anna, to the numerous encroachments and infractions which have been made by the present administration upon the laws and constitution of our beloved and adopted country. ""RESOLVED That as freemen devoted to a correct interpretation and enforcement of the Constitution, and laws, according to their true Spirit - We pledge our lives and fortunes in support of the same, and of the distinguished leader, who is now gallantly fighting in defence of Civil Liberty. ""RESOLVED That all the people of Texas be united to co-operate with us, in support of the principles incorporated in the foregoing resolutions. "
wikipedia-1261508," Nerina Pallot  Nerina Natasha Georgina Pallot (born 26 April 1975, London) is a platinum-selling, Brit- and Ivor Novello Award-nominated British singer and songwriter. Although born in London, Pallot was brought up in Jersey by a half-French father and a mother from Allahabad, India. Early life. Pallot played piano as a child and wrote her first song aged 13. She has identified seeing singer and pianist Kate Bush perform her hit song ""This Woman's Work"" on television as a catalyst for her to pursue a music career. She attended Jersey College for Girls. Career. ""Dear Frustrated Superstar"". Pallot released her debut album, ""Dear Frustrated Superstar"", on Polydor records in August 2001. This spawned two commercial singles, ""Patience"" and ""Alien"", with a third, ""If I Know You"" mooted, a video for which was filmed, but has never been publicly shown. Her album was withdrawn shortly before an arena tour with Bryan Adams, pending a planned reissue. Subsequently she was dropped from the label partly as a result of a message she wrote on the Tipsheet message board relating to the actions of her A&R man around remixes of ""Photograph"", a track intended to be on the re-issued ""Dear Frustrated Superstar"". This incident and many others related to the industry and her experiences with her debut album are discussed in stories on her official website. The album was eventually re-issued several years later after her second album, ""Fires"" had become a commercial success. The re-issue matched the original version and did not include ""Photograph"". Initial retailer listings showed the re-issued album as including several B-Sides from the era, but this version was never issued. In 2003 she sang lead vocals on the track ""Truly"" on Delerium's album ""Chimera"", which was also released as a single in the UK. ""Fires"". Her second album, ""Fires"", was released in April 2005 on her own independent label, Idaho. It was published by Chrysalis Music Publishing, who have stuck with her since her Polydor days and provided her with a development deal. They initially provided her with £50,000 to make the album. When that proved insufficient for Pallot's needs, she remortgaged her house to pay for the rest of the album and for living expenses. Pallot wrote all of the songs on ""Fires"". The album was produced and mixed by Howard Willing (OK Go, Stevie Nicks, Lisa Marie Presley, Melissa Auf der Maur, Liz Phair, The Smashing Pumpkins, Van Hunt), with producers Eric Rosse (Tori Amos, Lisa Marie Presley, Anna Nalick) who produced ""Learning to Breathe"" and ""Heart Attack"" (co-produced by Willing) and Wendy Melvoin (member of Prince's band The Revolution) who produced ""Damascus"". After the initial tracks were finished the rest of the record was apparently completed by Willing and Pallot flying files back and forth from London to Los Angeles. With the contacts and friendships that he had acquired over the years they were able to obtain the help of A-level musicians. The album was preceded by a download-only single, ""Everybody's Gone to War"". A second single from the record, ""Damascus"" was released in June 2005, and a third, ""All Good People"" (a Radio 2 single of the week) was released in September 2005. At the end of 2005, Pallot signed with major label 14th Floor Records (a Warner label), the home of Damien Rice and Joseph Arthur. After signing with 14th Floor Records, a re-issue of the album which was more 'spangly' (Pallot's words) and featured additional strings on some tracks, was released on 24 April 2006, earning Pallot a chart success by reaching Number 21. With over 100,000 sales it was certified gold in the UK. The first single from the revamped album was ""Everybody's Gone to War"", which was playlisted on most major British radio stations. The video was shown on most music television stations and on her MySpace profile. The single became the third most played song on British radio the week before its release, and reached Number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. The second single from the album was ""Sophia"", a re-recorded version, created in LA along with producer Mitchell Froom, which entered the UK singles chart at Number 32. In April 2007, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award. The next single from the re-released version of ""Fires"" was ""Learning to Breathe"", which reached Number 70 in the UK singles chart. ""The Graduate"". Pallot worked with several big name co-writers in preparation for the follow-up to ""Fires"", including Linda Perry (Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful"") and Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head""). She also wrote an album's worth of material with Rick Nowels (Madonna's ""Power of Goodbye"", Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven Is A Place on Earth""). However, she struggled with the co-writing process and in the end only self-written songs made the album. ""The Graduate"" was released on 5 October 2009 in the UK and reached number 46 in the Official UK Album Chart in its first week of release. The standard version of the album features 10 original tracks, whereas the iTunes version contains three additional tracks, and the deluxe version contains seven acoustic versions of the tracks. The album has polarised critics, with some lauding it as her best album yet and others seeing her change of direction from ""Fires"" as a mistake. Having had no intention of releasing ""Fires 2"", Pallot has defended the need for a progression between the two records. ""Year of the Wolf"". In July 2010, Pallot returned to Geffen Records and to the A&R that first signed her to Polydor. Pallot confirmed her new album would be titled ""Year of the Wolf"" via her Twitter page on 21 January 2011. She recorded with Bernard Butler for the album. The lead single was ""Put Your Hands Up"", released 24 April. The album was slated for release on the Geffen label on 30 May 2011 according to Nerina's Twitter page on 9 March 2011, but the release date was pushed to 13 June 2011, a change announced via Twitter on 5 May 2011. The American release date is 21 June 2011. Tours. Pallot has toured the UK many times as support act to more established singer-songwriters such as Sheryl Crow, James Blunt, Suzanne Vega, Joseph Arthur, Ray LaMontagne and Missy Higgins. She performed at the 2005 Guilfest music festival and headlined her own show at Bush Hall in Shepherd's Bush, London later that year. The first full headlining tour for the ""Fires"" album took place in May 2006. During the year she also played headline shows in London at ICA, the Bloomsbury Theatre, Regent's Park Open Air Theatre and at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Another UK and Ireland tour took place in January and February 2007, taking in venues in Penzance, Bristol, Cambridge, Milton Keynes, Manchester, Newcastle, Coventry, Brighton, Belfast, Dublin, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Sheffield. She toured the UK in October 2009, including a performance at Glasgow's Oran Mor venue on Wednesday 7 October, showcasing songs from the new album ""The Graduate"". This was her first proper tour in almost 3 years. She also toured the UK and Ireland once again in 2010, beginning 21 April in Bath, with eight dates, ending on 4 May in Dublin. Videos. Pallot has released six videos to go with singles from ""Dear Frustrated Superstar"", ""Fires"", and ""Year of the Wolf"". Her first video for ""Patience"", directed by Swedish director Emma Hvengaard, features Pallot in various scenes, notably wearing white and barefoot, continually floating to and from earth. ""Alien"" begins with Pallot lying down, it then becomes apparent that she had fallen onto a plumber's van, crushing it, and the video implies she has fallen from the sky ""like an alien"". The unreleased ""If I Know You"" video features multiple Nerinas fighting each other in a theatre. For ""Damascus"", Pallot is seen playing piano and singing in a recording studio. Pallot's next video was for ""Everybody's Gone to War"", which includes cabbage-throwing goths and pineapple bombs. Her next video was for ""Sophia"", and was filmed in the middle of the desert in Morocco. It has Pallot sitting at a piano, playing and singing while fire surrounds her in a circle and her piano smokes and is also alight. Nerina's next performance, ""Learning To Breathe"", is more ""abstract"" and is computer-generated with her playing the guitar in a house with many pictures decorating the walls. The video for ""Put Your Hands Up"", the lead single from ""Year of the Wolf"", was shot in and around Lant Street in Southwark, London. Awards and nominations. Pallot was nominated for British Female Solo Artist at the 2007 BRIT Awards. On 23 April 2007, it was announced that she had been nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for ""Sophia"" in the category of 'Best Song (musically and lyrically)'. Personal life. In early 2006 Pallot became engaged to Howard Willing, one of the producers who worked on her second album ""Fires"", but the relationship ended later that year. Pallot met fellow Jersey resident and Grammy Award-nominated record producer Andy Chatterley in January 2007. They became engaged within the first half hour of their first date, and married six weeks later on 14 February 2007. The story was told by Pallot on Janice Long's BBC Radio 2 show on 3 June 2009. Pallot recently completed her degree in English Literature at Birkbeck, University of London. The couple now reside in London. On 9 September 2010, Pallot announced via Twitter: ""@Andy_Chatterley and I are proud to present our finest song. Our son, Wolfie Chatterley, born this morning"". The child's full name is Wolfgang Amadeus Chatterley. On 1 July 2012, while performing at Cornbury Festival, Pallot confirmed once again that she is a fan of Arsenal F.C.. "
wikipedia-1261521," Tristia  The Tristia (""Sorrows"" or ""Lamentations"") is a collection of letters written in elegiac couplets by the Augustan poet Ovid during his exile from Rome. Despite five books of his copious bewailing of his fate, the immediate cause of Augustus's banishment of the greatest living Latin poet to Pontus in AD 8 remains a mystery. In addition to the ""Tristia"", Ovid wrote another collection of elegiac epistles on his exile, the ""Epistulae ex Ponto"". He spent several years in the outpost of Tomis and died without ever returning to Rome. The poems. The first volume was written during Ovid's journey into exile. It addresses his grieving wife, his friends—both the faithful and the false—,and his past works, especially the ""Metamorphoses"". Ovid describes his arduous travel to the furthest edge of the empire, giving him a chance to draw the obligatory parallels with the exiles of Aeneas and Odysseus (Ulysses) and excuse his work's failings. The introduction and dedication, which caution the departing volume against the dangers of its destination, were probably written last.  The second volume takes the form of a plea to Augustus to end the unhappy exile brought about by the famous ""carmen et error""—the nature of the mistake is never made clear, although some speculate it may have had something to do with Ovid's overhearing - or rather discovery - of the adulterous nature of Augustus' daughter, Julia. He defends his work and his life with equal vigor, appealing to the many poets who had written on the same themes as he—among them Anacreon, Sappho, Catullus, even Homer. The plea was unsuccessful; Ovid would live out the remainder of his years in exile among the Thracian Getae. The last three books of the ""Tristia"" grow grimmer as their author ages, heavy with the knowledge that he will never return to his home. At one point he even composes his epitaph: The last part of the book addresses Ovid's wife, praising her loyalty throughout his years of exile and wishing that she be remembered for as long as his books are read. "
wikipedia-1261522," Colorist  In comics, a colorist is responsible for adding color to black-and-white line art. For most of the 20th century this was done using brushes and dyes which were then used as guides to produce the printing plates. Since the late 20th century it is most often done using digital media, with printing separations produced electronically. Although most American colorists work directly for comics publishers (either as employees or freelancers), there are a few coloring studios which offer their services to publishers. American Color, Olyoptics, and Digital Chameleon were companies notable in this field. History. Originally, comics were colored by cutting out films of various densities in the appropriate shapes to be used in producing color-separated printing plates. The typical colorist worked from photocopies of the inked pages, which they colored with special dyes. Dr. Martin's Dyes was a brand notable in this field within the comic strip industry. CMYK codes were written on the page to indicate the final printed colors, and these hand-colored pages were used as guides by the engraver. Tatjana Wood was the main colorist for DC Comics' covers from 1973 through the mid-1980s. More recently, colorists have worked in transparent media such as watercolors or airbrush, which is then photographed, allowing more subtle and painterly effects. Digital color. Colorist Steve Oliff and his company Olyoptics were one of the first to use computers to do color separations. Although other companies at the time were experimenting with computers, Oliff and his crew were the first to blend the color guide artist with the separator. In 1987, the Japanese manga ""Akira"" was in preparation to be translated and published by Marvel Comics's Epic Comics line. Oliff was chosen as the colorist, and he convinced Marvel that it was time to try computer color. After the publication of ""Akira"" in 1988, computer coloring became increasingly prevalent in the comics industry. By the early 1990s, even though the larger comics publishers were using computers, there were variations within the field. DC Comics allowed only a 64-color palette, while Marvel had expanded it to 125 colors. Dark Horse Comics allowed even more variations. The dominant programs in use during that time were Color Prep and Tint Prep, both originally implemented by Olyoptics. In 1993, Image Comics' use of computer color and more advanced color separation technology propelled DC and Marvel to further upgrade their coloring techniques. Finally, in the mid-1990s, Digital Chameleon's facility with Adobe Photoshop helped make that program the industry standard. The improvements in the technology used for coloring have had a great impact on the way comics are drawn. Before the use of computers, artists would often use the pen or brush to put in detailed shading effects; now the artist is more likely to leave the drawing open and leave it to the colorist to insert shading through variation in color tones or through adding a layer of translucent black. Most contemporary colorists work in digital media using tools. "
wikipedia-1261548," Station to Station  Station to Station is the tenth studio album by English musician David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ""Station to Station"" was the vehicle for his last great character, The Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and recalls almost nothing of the production. Musically, ""Station to Station"" was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, ""Young Americans"", while presenting a new direction towards synthesisers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as Kraftwerk and Neu!. This trend culminated in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called "", recorded with Brian Eno in 1977–79. Bowie himself has said that ""Station to Station"" was ""a plea to come back to Europe for me"". The album’s lyrics reflected his preoccupations with Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion. With its blend of funk and Krautrock, romantic balladry and occultism, ""Station to Station"" has been described as ""simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable"". Preceded by the single ""Golden Years"", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2003, the album was ranked #323 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Background. According to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based David Bowie, fuelled by an ""astronomic"" cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of peppers and milk, spent much of 1975–76 ""in a state of psychic terror"". Stories—mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ""Playboy"" and ""Rolling Stone""—circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient-Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from The Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of fellow Aleister Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page. Bowie would later say of L.A., ""The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth"". It was on the set of his first major film, ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ""The Return of the Thin White Duke"". He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition (at Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead). Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness. The Thin White Duke became the mouthpiece for ""Station to Station"" and, as often as not during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, The Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing—""ice masquerading as fire"". The persona has been described as ""a mad aristocrat"", ""an amoral zombie"", and ""an emotionless ""Aryan"" superman"". For Bowie himself, The Duke was ""a nasty character indeed"". Production. ""Station to Station"" was recorded in 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, ""NME"" editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—""in 10 days of feverish activity""—when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"". More recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months, in October–November 1975, and was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack. At various times to be titled ""The Return of The Thin White Duke"", or ""Golden Years"", ""Station to Station"" was co-produced by Harry Maslin, Bowie's associate for ""Fame"" and ""Across the Universe"" on ""Young Americans"". Tony Visconti, who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ""Diamond Dogs"" and co-producing ""David Live"" and ""Young Americans"", was not involved due to competing schedules. However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist George Murray joining ""Young Americans"" drummer Dennis Davis and rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar. The recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)"" in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, Roy Bittan and Earl Slick, respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song. According to Bowie, ""I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick. I think it captured his imagination to make ""noises"" on guitar, and textures, rather than playing the right notes."" Alomar recalled, ""It was one of the most glorious albums that I've ever done ... We experimented so much on it"". Harry Maslin added, ""I loved those sessions because we were totally open and experimental in our approach"". Bowie himself remembers almost nothing of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, ""I know it was in LA because I've read it was"". The singer was not alone in his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, ""if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke ... the coke use is driven by the inspiration."" Like Bowie, Earl Slick had somewhat vague memories of the recording: ""That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights."" The sleeve front cover used a black and white still from ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, steps into the space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black and white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial. When Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something he had been doing on the set of the film. Style and themes. ""Station to Station"" is often cited as a transitional album in Bowie's career. Nicholas Pegg, author of ""The Complete David Bowie"", called it a ""precise halfway point on the journey from ""Young Americans"" to ""Low"""", while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it ""effectively divides the '70's for David Bowie. It ties off the era of Ziggy Stardust and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with 'Low'."" In terms of Bowie's own output, ""Station to Station""'s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like ""Aladdin Sane 1913-1938-197?"" and ""Time"" (1973), while its funk/disco elements were a development of the soul/R&B sound of ""Young Americans"" (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of German motorik and electronic music by bands like Neu!, Can and Kraftwerk. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as ""The Supermen"" from ""The Man Who Sold the World"" (1970) and ""Quicksand"" from ""Hunky Dory"" (1971): Nietzsche's 'Overman', the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Nazi fascination with Grail mythology, and the Kabbalah. Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of ""occultism and Christianity"". The musical style of ""Golden Years"", the first track recorded for the album, built on the funk and soul of ""Young Americans"" but with a harsher, grinding edge. It has been described as carrying with it ""an air of regret for missed opportunities and past pleasures"". Bowie said that it was written for—and rejected by—Elvis Presley, while Bowie's wife at the time Angie claimed it was penned for her. Though a top ten single on both sides of the Atlantic, it was rarely performed live on the subsequent ""Station to Station"" tour. ""Stay"" was another riff-driven funk piece, ""recorded very much in our cocaine frenzy"", according to Alomar. Its lyrics have been variously interpreted as reflecting on ""the uncertainty of sexual conquest"", and as an example of ""the Duke's spurious romanticism"". The Christian element of the album was most obvious in the hymn-like ""Word on a Wing"", though for some commentators religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to ""test his numbness"". Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, ""the passion is genuine"". When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from ""the darkest days of my life... I'm sure that it was a call for help"". The closing ballad, ""Wild Is the Wind"", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised as one of the finest vocal performances of Bowie's career. Bowie was inspired to record the song after he met singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone, who sang it on the album ""Wild Is the Wind"" (1966). The spectre of ""The Man Who Fell to Earth""'s Thomas Jerome Newton sprawled in front of dozens of television monitors is said to have partly inspired the album's most upbeat track, ""TVC15"". Supposedly also about Iggy Pop's girlfriend being eaten by a TV set, it has been called ""incongruously jolly"" and ""the most oblique tribute to The Yardbirds imaginable"". The title track has been described as heralding ""a new era of experimentalism"" for Bowie. ""Station to Station"" was in two parts: a slow, portentous piano-driven march, introduced by the sound of an approaching train juxtaposed with Earl Slick's agitated guitar feedback, followed by an up-tempo rock/blues section. In 1999 Bowie told ""UNCUT"" magazine, ""Since Station To Station the hybridization of R&B and electronics had been a goal of mine"". Despite the noise of a train in the opening moments, Bowie claims that the title refers not so much to railway stations as to the Stations of the Cross, while the line ""From Kether to Malkuth"" relates to mystical places in the Kabbalah, mixing Christian and Jewish allusions. Fixation with the occult was further evident in such phrases as ""white stains"", the name of a book of poetry by Aleister Crowley. The lyrics also gave notice of Bowie's recent drug use (""It's not the side effects of the cocaine / I'm thinking that it must be love""). With its Krautrock influence, it was the album's clearest foretaste of Bowie's subsequent "". Speaking to ""Creem"" magazine in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that ""Station to Station"" was ""devoid of spirit ... Even the love songs are detached, but I think it's fascinating."" Singles and unreleased tracks. Every song on ""Station to Station"", with the exception of the title track, eventually appeared on a single. ""Golden Years"" was released in November 1975, two months before the album. Bowie allegedly got drunk to perform it on TV for the American show ""Soul Train"", resulting in the film clip seen on music video programmes. It reached #8 in the UK and #10 in the US (where it charted for sixteen weeks) but, like ""Rebel Rebel""'s relationship to ""Diamond Dogs"" (1974), was a somewhat unrepresentative teaser for the album to come. ""TVC15"" was released in edited form as the second single in May 1976, reaching #33 in the UK and #64 stateside. ""Stay"", also shortened and appearing the same month, was issued as a companion 45 to RCA's ""Changesonebowie"" greatest hits collection, though it did not appear on the compilation (""Changesonebowie"" was itself packaged as a uniform edition to ""Station to Station"", featuring a black-and-white cover and similar lettering). In November 1981, as Bowie's relationship with RCA was winding down, ""Wild Is the Wind"" was issued as a single to push the ""Changestwobowie"" compilation. Backed with ""Word on a Wing"" and accompanied by a video shot especially for the release, it made #24 in the UK and charted for ten weeks. Another song purportedly recorded during the album sessions at Cherokee Studios, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City"", went unreleased at the time but was issued in 1990 on the ""Sound and Vision"" box set. Harry Maslin and Carlos Alomar have claimed that they never recorded the song during the Cherokee sessions, while Tony Visconti believes that the song most likely consisted of overdubs to a track originally cut at Olympic and Island Studios during the ""Diamond Dogs"" sessions, with Aynsley Dunbar on drums, Herbie Flowers on bass and Mike Garson on keyboards. Release and reception. ""Station to Station"" was released in January 1976. ""Billboard"" considered that Bowie had ""found his musical niche"" following songs like ""Fame"" and ""Golden Years"" but that ""the 10-minute title cut drags"". ""NME"" called it ""one of the most significant albums released in the last five years"". Both found the meaning of the lyrics difficult to fathom. In his consumer guide for ""The Village Voice"", critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A rating, indicating ""a great record both of whose sides offer enduring pleasure and surprise. You should own it"". Christgau wrote that Bowie ""can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Huey Smith"" and found the album a progression from his previous albums, stating ""Miraculously, Bowie's attraction to black music has matured; even more miraculously, the new relationship seems to have left his hard-and-heavy side untouched"". ""Rolling Stone"" writer Teri Moris applauded the album's 'rockier' moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it ""the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms ... while there's little doubt about his skill, one wonders how long he'll continue wrestling with rock at all."" ""Circus"", noting that Bowie was ""never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life"", declared that ""Station to Station"" ""offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face."" The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the ""density"" of ""The Man Who Sold the World"", the ""pop feel"" of ""Hunky Dory"", the ""dissonance and angst"" of ""Aladdin Sane"", the ""compelling percussion"" of ""Young Americans"", and the ""youthful mysticism"" of ""Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud"", concluding that ""it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey"". ""Station to Station"" was Bowie's highest-charting album in the US until 2013's ""The Next Day"", reaching #3 and remaining for 32 weeks. It was certified gold by the RIAA on 26 February 1976. In the UK, it charted for seventeen weeks, peaking at #5, the last time one of his studio albums placed lower in his home country than in America. Aftermath. With the ""Station to Station"" sessions completed in December 1975, Bowie started work on a soundtrack for ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" with Paul Buckmaster as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that ""when I'd finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people's... and I just said ""Shit, you're not getting any of it"". I was so furious, I'd put ""so"" much work into it."" Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was ""burned out"" and couldn't complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, ""There were pieces of me laying all over the floor"". In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into ""Subterraneans"" on his next studio album, ""Low"". After abandoning the soundtrack album, Bowie went on tour in support of ""Station to Station"", commencing 2 February 1976 and completing on 18 May 1976. Kraftwerk's ""Radioactivity"" was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from Luis Buñuel's and Salvador Dalí's surrealist film ""Un Chien Andalou"". The staging featured Bowie, dressed in The Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of Gitanes placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among ""curtains of white light"", an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'. In 1989 Bowie reflected, ""I wanted to go back to a kind of Expressionist German-film look... and the lighting of, say, Fritz Lang or Pabst. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I’ve ever done."" The ""Station to Station"" tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known bootlegs, culled from an FM radio broadcast of his 23 March 1976 concert at Nassau Coliseum. Bowie drew criticism during the tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, ""Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country"", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the ""Station to Station"" tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that ""Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader"". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of The Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ""NME"". Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the throng that day: ""Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it ..."" The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines ""To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading"" from ""Scary Monsters""' opening track ""It's No Game"", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all. Legacy. ""Station to Station"" was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late-1970s 'Berlin Trilogy'. Bowie himself has said of the album, ""As far as the music goes, ""Low"" and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track"", while Brian Eno opined that ""Low"" was ""very much a continuation from ""Station to Station"""". It has also been described as ""enormously influential on post-punk"". Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray wrote in 1981, ""If ""Low"" was Gary Numan's Bowie album, then ""Station to Station"" was Magazine's."" However, ""Stylus"" declared in 2004 that ""just as few had anticipated Bowie’s approach, few copied it ... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style"". More than twenty years after its release, Bowie considered both ""Station to Station"" and ""Low"" ""great, damn good"" albums, but due to his disconnected state during its recording, listened to ""Station to Station"" ""as a piece of work by an entirely different person"". He elaborated: In 1999, music biographer David Buckley described ""Station to Station"" as a ""masterpiece of invention"" that ""some critics would argue, perhaps unfashionably, is his finest record"". The same year, Eno called it ""one of the great records of all time"". In 2003, the album was ranked #323 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. A year later, ""The Observer"" ranked the album #80 on its list of the 100 greatest British albums. Track listing. All songs written by David Bowie, except where noted. CD releases.

wikipedia-1261557," ""Heroes""  ""Heroes"" is the twelfth studio album by David Bowie, released in 1977. The second installment of his Berlin Trilogy with Brian Eno (the other releases being ""Low"" and ""Lodger"") """"Heroes"""" developed further the sound of ""Low"". Of the three albums, it was the most befitting of the appellation ""Berlin"", being the only one wholly recorded there. The title track remains one of Bowie's best known, a classic story of two lovers who meet at the Berlin Wall. The album is considered one of his best by critics, notably for the contributions of guitarist Robert Fripp who flew in from the US to record his parts in one day. It was named ""NME"" Album of the Year. Production and style. Recorded at Hansa Tonstudio in what was then West Berlin, """"Heroes"""" reflected the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city. Co-producer Tony Visconti considered it ""one of my last great adventures in making albums. The studio was about 500 yards from the wall. Red Guards would look into our control-room window with powerful binoculars."" David Bowie again paid tribute to his Krautrock influences: the title is a nod to the track ""Hero"" on the album ""NEU! '75"" by the German band Neu! – whose guitarist Michael Rother had originally been approached to play on the album – while ""V-2 Schneider"" is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk's Florian Schneider. Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk had name-checked Bowie on the title track of ""Trans-Europe Express"". The cover photo by Masayoshi Sukita was inspired by German artist Erich Heckel's ""Roquairol"", as was that of ""The Idiot"", one of Bowie's collaborations with Iggy Pop that was released the same year. Brian Eno called up Robert Fripp and invited him to play guitar on the album. Fripp, who had considered himself retired from music, said ""Well, I don’t know because I haven’t played for three years, but if you’re prepared to take a risk, then so am I."" Upon arriving at the studio, jetlagged from his flight in, he played on the track ""Beauty and the Beast"" and his first take was used in the song's final mix. Though """"Heroes"""" included a number of dark and atmospheric instrumentals such as ""Sense of Doubt"" and ""Neuköln"", it was regarded as a highly passionate and positive artistic statement, particularly after the often melancholy ""Low"". This relative optimism was evident not only through ""'Heroes'"" the song but in the rocking opener ""Beauty and the Beast"" (released as the second single in January 1978), the raucous ""Joe the Lion"" and the light-hearted closer ""The Secret Life of Arabia"". The lyrics for ""Joe the Lion"", written and recorded at the microphone ""in less than an hour"" according to Visconti, typified the improvisational nature of the recording. Release and aftermath. """"Heroes"""" was marketed by RCA with the catchphrase, ""There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie..."" It enjoyed a positive critical reception on release in late 1977, ""Melody Maker"" and ""NME"" both naming it 'Album of the Year'. It reached #3 in the UK and stayed in the charts for 26 weeks, but was less successful in the US where it peaked at #35. The album was released in Germany with the track ""Heroes/Helden"", the lyrics sung partly in German. Its influence is enduring: John Lennon said that when making his album ""Double Fantasy"" in 1980, his ambition was to ""do something as good as ""Heroes""."" A number of the album's tracks were played live at Bowie's concerts the following year, the ""Low and Heroes World Tour"" captured on record as ""Stage"" (1978). Philip Glass adapted a classical suite, """"Heroes"" Symphony"", based on this album, a companion to his earlier ""Low Symphony"". The title track has been covered by numerous artists, and has been frequently used as an encore by recent incarnations of King Crimson, while ""The Secret Life of Arabia"" was sung by Billy Mackenzie in 1982 on the British Electric Foundation LP ""Music of Quality and Distinction"".

wikipedia-1261562," Bartholomew Columbus  Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese: Bertomê Corombo; ; ) (c. 1461 – 1515) was a Genoese explorer and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. Biography. Born in the Republic of Genoa, in the 1470s Bartholomew was a mapmaker in Lisbon, the principal center of cartography of the time, and conceived with his brother the ""Enterprise of the Indies"", a scheme to reach the Orient and its lucrative spice trade by a western rather than an eastern route. In 1489 he went to England to seek assistance from Henry VII for the execution of the scheme. He was taken by pirates and landed in England in a destitute condition, and on presenting himself at Court was unfavorably received by the King. He then sought help at the court of Charles VIII in France, with a similar lack of success. Meanwhile his brother Christopher was in Spain to persuade Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon to back the scheme.  When word arrived in 1493 that his brother had succeeded, Bartholomew returned to Spain, where he missed Christopher, who had already left on the second voyage of his four to the ""New World"". Funded by the crown, Bartholomew Columbus traveled to Hispaniola in 1494 to meet his brother. After captaining one of the ships he remained on the island for six and a half years (1494–1500), serving as governor with the title of Adelantado during his brother's absences. He founded the city of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola between 1496 and 1498, which is now the capital of the Dominican Republic. He was imprisoned together with Christopher and another brother, Giacomo (also called Diego), by Francisco de Bobadilla and returned to Spain in December 1500. After the royal pardon of Christopher Columbus, Bartholomew Columbus accompanied him on the last of his New World voyages.  Following Christopher Columbus's death in 1506 Bartholomew returned to the Antilles, accompanying his nephew Diego, but Bartholomew soon returned to Spain when the king confirmed his concession involving Mona Island near Puerto Rico; the king would reclaim the appealing little island from Bartholomew's heirs after Bartholomew's death on 12 August 1514 (by which time Bartholomew had returned to Hispaniola).  Bartholomew Columbus is known to have fathered a daughter out of wedlock, named Maria and born in 1508. "
wikipedia-1261575," Mike Keneally  Michael Joseph Keneally (born December 20, 1961) is an American guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and composer. Allmusic says: ""With his wide-ranging talents and ability to be creative in almost any musical situation, Keneally is the leading progressive rock genius of the post-Zappa era."" Early years and musical influences. Keneally started playing music at the age of 7 when he had received an electric organ for his birthday. He had also received a guitar on his eleventh birthday, and also plays bass and drums. His early childhood musical influences included The Beatles, and theme music from cartoon and television shows such as, ""The Wallace and Ladmo Show"" and """". Career. Born on Long Island, New York, he moved to San Diego, California, at an early age and has been a fixture on the local music scene there since 1985 when he formed the local cult band, Drop Control. Although a well established musician in his own right, Keneally is probably most well known as former Frank Zappa ""stunt guitarist"" and a Zappa 1988 tour band member on both guitar and keyboards. His ascendency to that position is legendary in certain musician circles, based on Keneally's command of Zappa's vast and difficult-to-play repertoire.  Keneally had called Zappa and said that he was ""extremely familiar with all of his material and that he would be ready to play any of it for him given a short amount of preparation time"", as he had already ""been listening to Zappa's music for 16 years"". ""On the phone the day before the audition Frank had told me to have ""What's New In Baltimore?"" and ""Sinister Footwear"" ready for the next day's audition"". On the way to the audition Keneally practiced the aforementioned songs, as well as ""Little House I Used To Live In"", and ""every single Zappa melody I could think of, kind of as an exercise for my memory"" as his brother Marty was driving the car.  Keneally's stint in the Zappa touring band was short-lived with the early cancellation of the 1988 tour and Zappa's death in 1993. Keneally moved on from the elder Zappa's band to work with the eldest Zappa son, Dweezil on his solo albums and work released as the band, Z.  Keneally has also released 11 albums of solo material since 1992 and has guested or acted as sideman on a wide variety of projects, most notably as part of Steve Vai's touring bands. He has played guitar and keyboards with Yo Miles!, Wadada Leo Smith, Norwegian legends Ulver and Henry Kaiser's Miles Davis tribute band as well as recording the 1995 album The Mistakes with Henry Kaiser, Prairie Prince, and Andy West (formerly of Dixie Dregs). He has also produced albums for several bands, including Chris Opperman's debut album, .  In 1998 Vai requested that Keneally arrange and perform an album of Vai's music on acoustic piano. Recorded in 1999, the album was finally released in 2004 as """". According to liner notes, Vai selected the songs, produced the album, and mixed it, releasing it on his own ""Light Without Heat"" label. As of 2008 Keneally has arranged from multi-tracked guitar parts to single-track piano the 12 songs selected by Steve and begun work on a second volume of Vai ""Piano Reductions"".  On May 1, 2007, Keneally's Exowax label re-released his debut album ""hat."" and ""Boil That Dust Speck"" as deluxe, remastered double disc versions. Exowax has obtained Keneally's entire back catalog from Immune Records. Planned releases included ""Half Alive In Hollywood"" and ""Sluggo!"" as well as The Mike Keneally and Beer For Dolphins 1996 VHS release ""Soap Scum Remover,"" which will be remixed and remastered for a DVD release, and The Mistakes, his 1995 side project with Henry Kaiser on guitar and Synclavier, bassist Andy West and drummer Prairie Prince), along with a live Mistakes recording that has been held on the side until Keneally was able to re-acquire the rights to the original album. On November 28, 2006, Keneally announced that he was hired as National Music Director for The Paul Green School of Rock Music. He has also toured with Dethklok as a guitarist and back up vocalist. On July 20, 2008, at El Cajon, Calif., Mike played a concert as part of ""the most exciting power trio in years,"" Keneally • Minnemann • Beller (KMB), consisting of Mike, drummer Marco Minnemann and long-time collaborating bassist Bryan Beller. The band undertook a full tour in 2009 and became Joe Satriani's worldwide touring band in 2013. In August 2009, Keneally released a video for a new solo track, ""Hallmark,"" from ""Scambot 1,"" the first part of a planned three-album series. In June 2010, Keneally entered Skywalker Sound as part of the studio band for Joe Satriani's new solo project, along with regular Satriani drummer Jeff Campitelli and bassist Allen Whitman (of San Francisco's surf/psychedelic group The Mermen). This same lineup is scheduled to tour in October and November 2010 in support of the album, however Keneally was replaced by English keyboardist Jem Godfrey for 2 dates on the UK leg of the tour. In July 2012, Keneally released ""Wing Beat Fantastic: Songs written by Mike Keneally & Andy Partridge"", an collaborative album consisting primarily of songs co-written with XTC's Andy Partridge during 2 writing sessions in 2006 & 2008, and of whose band and work Keneally has been a longtime fan (there is a small section of XTC's ""Mayor Of Simpleton"" in the song ""Day Of The Cow 2"" from his 1992 debut solo album hat.)

wikipedia-1261589," Chrysoprase  Chrysoprase, chrysophrase or chrysoprasus is a gemstone variety of chalcedony (a cryptocrystalline form of silica) that contains small quantities of nickel. Its color is normally apple-green, but varies to deep green. The darker varieties of chrysoprase are also referred to as prase. (However, the term prase is also used to describe chlorite-included quartz, and to a certain extent is a color-descriptor, rather than a rigorously defined mineral variety.) Chrysoprase is cryptocrystalline, which means that it is composed of crystals so fine that they cannot be seen as distinct particles under normal magnification. This sets it apart from rock crystal, amethyst, citrine, and the other varieties of crystalline quartz which are basically transparent and formed from easily recognized six-sided crystals. Other members of the cryptocrystalline silica family include agate, carnelian, and onyx. Unlike many non-transparent silica minerals, it is the color of chrysoprase, rather than any pattern of markings, that makes it desirable. The word chrysoprase comes from the Greek χρυσός ""chrysos"" meaning 'gold' and πράσινον ""prasinon"", meaning 'green'. Unlike emerald which owes its green color to the presence of chromium, the color of chrysoprase is due to trace amounts of nickel compounds in form of very small inclusions. The nickel reportedly occurs as different silicates, like kerolite or pimelite (not NiO mineral, bunsenite, as was reported before). Chrysoprase results from the deep weathering or lateritization of nickeliferous serpentinites or other ultramafic ophiolite rocks. In the Australian deposits, chrysoprase occurs as veins and nodules with brown goethite and other iron oxides in the magnesite-rich saprolite below an iron and silica cap. As with all forms of chalcedony, chrysoprase has a hardness of 6–7 on the Mohs hardness scale and a conchoidal fracture like flint. The best known sources of chrysoprase are Queensland, Western Australia, Germany, Poland, Russia, Arizona, California, and Brazil. The chrysoprase and Ni silicate ore deposit in Szklary, Lower Silesia, Poland, was probably the biggest European chrysoprase occurrence and possibly also the biggest in the world. A very similar mineral to chrysoprase is chrome chalcedony, in which the color is provided by chromium rather than nickel. "
wikipedia-1261599," Ossessione  Ossessione (Obsession) is a 1943 film based on the novel, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", by James M. Cain. Luchino Visconti’s first feature film, it is considered by many to be the first Italian neorealist film, though there is some debate about whether such a categorization is accurate. Historical context. Working under the censorship of the Fascist Italian government, Visconti encountered problems with the production even before filming commenced. He had initially planned to adapt a story by Giovanni Verga, a renowned Italian realist writer and one of his greatest influences, but it was turned down almost immediately by the Fascist authorities due to its subject matter, which revolved around bandits. Around this time, Visconti uncovered a French translation of Cain’s novel which, famously, had been given to him by French director Jean Renoir while he was working in France in the 1930s. Visconti adapted the script with a group of men he selected from the Milanese magazine ""Cinema"". The members of this group were talented filmmakers and writers and played a large role in the emerging neorealist movement: Mario Alicata, Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli and Giuseppe De Santis. When ""Ossessione"" was completed and released in 1943, it was far from the innocent murder mystery the authorities had expected; after a few screenings in Rome and northern Italy, prompting outraged reactions from Fascist and Church authorities, the film was banned by the Fascist government reestablished in the German occupied part of Italy after the September 1943 armistice. Eventually the Fascists destroyed the film, but Visconti managed to keep a duplicate negative from which all existing prints have been made. After the war, ""Ossessione"" encountered more problems with mass distribution, this time in the United States. As a result of the wartime production schedule, Visconti had never obtained the rights to the novel and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer began production on another version of the film, directed by Tay Garnett (""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", 1946), while the Fascist ban on Visconti’s work was still in effect.  Due to the copyright issues, the film didn’t gain distribution outside of Italy until 1976. Despite limited screenings, it gained acclaim among moviegoers who recognized in it some of the same sensibilities they had grown familiar with in neorealist films by Michelangelo Antonioni, Puccini and De Santis, among others. Plot. The film is the story of a wandering tramp who has an affair with the wife of a restaurant owner. The two then conspire to murder her husband and attempt to live happily ever after. The catch is built into the title of the book, however, and the long arm of the law rings again to disrupt the couple’s already guilt-wracked life, ironically convicting the tramp for an accidental death despite his being absolved of guilt in the actual murder. Cinematic technique. For the most part, Visconti retained the plot of the novel. He made changes such as tailoring the script to its Italian setting and adding a character, but the main departure from the novel and the defining characteristic of the film is the manner in which it confronts the realities of life. In one particularly memorable scene that anticipates a major theme of neorealism, ""Ossessione""’s central female character enters her wildly messy kitchen, serves herself a bowl of soup and sits down with a newspaper only to fall asleep, slumped over wearily in the midst of the confusion. At several moments like this one, Visconti slows the pace to give the viewer an even more penetrating glimpse into the routine of his characters, and in doing so, roots the narrative squarely in the life of his characters. In another scene, the three are eating when Bregana comments that a local landowner has been shot from behind by a worker, believed to be the result of the worker's love for the landowner's wife. In this way, Visconti foreshadows Bregana’s own death and illuminates the study of class tension that is woven fluidly into the film. Soon afterwards, Bregana submits to his wife's physical and verbal responses to cats outside crying or due to the heat (in heat.) He fetches his shotgun and leaves. Shortly after his exit, the adulterous lovers huddle close and hear gunshots, thereby hinting at the doom also reserved for two lovers ""in heat.""  The landscape itself is realistic, and Visconti takes great care to situate his characters in a rural Italy that remains for the most part unromanticized. Nearly the entire story is told using medium and long shots, with Visconti choosing to employ close-ups only at moments of intense emotion. Characters are depicted interacting with and moving around within their environment; to this effect, Visconti favors long and ponderous shots while making use of depth of focus to highlight the variety of action occurring throughout the space of the frame. He resists identifying solely with one character and prefers instead to maintain a distance, taking them all in with his viewfinder as independent but irrevocably tangled components of a larger cast, which includes the sets, scenery and landscape as well as what goes on outside of the frame. Shots of the landscape largely consist of the dusty road winding into the distance and the interior shots are just as bleak; the dowdy kitchen exudes a nearly tangible film of dust and grime and the dingy hotel room that speaks, with each detail, of the rebellious freedom cherished by those who share it. The shift of focus from the novel is clear even in Visconti’s decision to change the title. Whereas the novel’s title alludes to the final retribution exacted upon the adulterous couple, Visconti’s header bespeaks the focus of his film—obsessive passion. Despite arguments about how to define neorealist cinema, certainly one of ""Ossessione""’s most poignant aspects is its stark realism. Despite being popular actors of Italian cinema, the stars of the film, Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai, deliver breathtaking performances that are anything but glamorous. The lovers, Gino and Giovanna, played by Girotti and Calamai, first meet in the kitchen of the inn that Giovanna runs with her husband, the fat and dim-witted Bregana. It is in the symbolic and literal center of the family sphere, before they ever touch, that the two make a silent oath. Their love, tainted as it is by a lie, is difficult for either of them to bear and the tension is only exacerbated by Bregana’s overwhelming presence. Unable to continue the affair under such pretense but genuinely in love, Gino tries to persuade Giovanna to leave with him. She is clearly tempted, but knows of the power the road has over Gino, a relationship that Visconti executes nearly as palpably as that between him and Giovanna. She ultimately refuses Gino, opting for the security and stability that Bregana has to offer, and he sets out once again unencumbered. When they cross paths some time later, it is in the city and Bregana is extremely drunk, engaged in a singing competition. Against the backdrop of the drunken and foolish Bregana, the couple plans his death, an act they carry out in a car crash. Rather than granting them the freedom they so desperately seek, however, the murder only heightens the need for deception and makes more acute the guilt they had previously been dealing with. Despite Giovanna’s attempt to construct a normal life with Gino, Bregana’s presence seems to remain long after they return to the inn. Their already crumbling relationship reaches its bounds when they go to collect the money from Bregana’s life insurance policy. They have a very hostile argument and Gino retaliates by engaging Anita, an attractive young prostitute. Though Giovanna is pregnant and there seems to be some hope for the couple, Gino is left alone to deal with the law when Giovanna is killed in the film’s second car crash. The character of lo Spagnolo (the Spaniard), Visconti’s main textual departure from the novel, plays a pivotal role in the story of ""Ossessione"". After failing to convince Giovanna to flee with him, Gino meets lo Spagnolo after boarding a train to the city and the two of them strike up an instant friendship, subsequently working and living together. Lo Spagnolo is an actor who works as a street vendor and serves as a foil to Giovanna’s traditionalism and inability to let go of the material lifestyle. In contrast to the other main characters, who come across as very real and thoroughly developed, Spagnolo operates chiefly on a symbolic level. He represents for Gino the possibility of a liberated masculinity living a life successfully separate from society’s impositions, an alternative to the life he is drawn toward in his relationship with Giovanna. Both Giovanna and Gino are tragic characters in their inability to comfortably find a space in which to situate themselves. The limited roles made available by society prove to be insufficient in providing narratives for their lives that bring them closer to happiness. Giovanna is pulled away from the security of her marriage to the repulsive Bregana by a desire for true love and fulfillment, whose potential is actualized with the appearance of Gino. Her attempts to hold onto the fortune which came with marriage, however, ultimately lead to the failure of their relationship and perhaps, by extension, her death. Gino’s situation seems to be just as distinct, if not more so, as the force pulling him away from Giovanna is his fear of a traditional commitment. From the first time they sleep together, after which Giovanna shares with Gino all of her deepest problems while he listens to the sound of waves in a seashell, it is clear that he answers only to the open road, identifying it as his alternative to becoming an active part of mainstream society. Spagnolo is the road manifest, masculine freedom in opposition to Giovanna’s femininity, love and family values. Caught in between the two conflicting ideals, Gino ends up violating both of them and dooming himself in the process. Visconti’s approach to filmmaking is very structured and he provides several pairs of parallel events, such as the car crashes. Gino meets Spagnolo as they sit side by side on a wall, a scene that is repeated at the end of their friendship; similarly, Gino angrily leaves Giovanna by the side of the road and is later abandoned by Spagnolo in a parallel scene. Cinematic techniques, such as the instances in which Visconti foreshadows major plot twists or the introduction of Spagnolo as a counterweight, demonstrate Visconti’s formalist streak and technical virtuosity, but his realist vision and taste for drama are truly what breathe life into ""Ossessione"".

wikipedia-1261600," Gunstar Heroes  Treasure's debut game was originally released on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in late 1993, and later on, ported to the Game Gear by M2. On February 23, 2006, ""Gunstar Heroes"" was released as part of the ""Gunstar Heroes: Treasure Box"" Collection for the PlayStation 2. It is also available on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. In 2009 it was released on June 10 for Xbox Live Arcade and June 11 for PlayStation Network. Gameplay. ""Gunstar Heroes"" is a side scrolling shooter. The player has four weapons to choose from, and these four can be combined in pairs to create an additional 10 weapons, for a total of 14. In addition to the weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. It is possible to grab and toss enemies, perform sliding and jumping attacks and a long-range skid. Unlike most games in the genre, the player has a life total calculated in numbers. Death to a player requires multiple hits but just one death will issue the option to continue from the start of the level or to end the game. Players have unlimited continues. The main highlight of the game are its boss encounters, which often feature large enemies made up of multiple sprites allowing for fluid movement. Weapons. ""Gunstar Heroes"" featured four basic weapon types: Force, a powerful shot that fires rapidly; Lightning, a straight shot that goes through enemies; Chaser, which homes in on enemies; and Flame, a shot that is very effective at close range.  By combining two weapons, a new weapon can be formed. For example, combining Lightning and Chaser gives a homing lightning beam attack. Reception. ""Gunstar Heroes"" was awarded Best Action Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. ""MegaTech"" magazine praised the animation and speed of gameplay, and could not think of any downsides to the game. Versions and releases. Shortly after its original release, ""Gunstar Heroes"" made its way to Sega's handheld machine, Game Gear. The port was handled not by Treasure, but by development house M2. As the console's power could not be matched to that of the Mega Drive, the game was significantly scaled down, stripping its multi-player mode, Black's Dice Maze, and several graphic effects. It does, however, add in a few new features such as a jetpack level and the chance to drive one of the later walker robots from the 16-bit version. The game received a PC port on December 17, 2004 as a part of the Sega Honpo series, titled . On October 6, 2005, Treasure and Sega released ""Gunstar Super Heroes"", a ""Gunstar"" title for the Game Boy Advance. The game makes a few changes to the gameplay, such as having a fixed weapon selection and the addition of 'super' attacks controlled by the trigger. In addition, it presents itself as a distant sequel to the original, but the levels and bosses are remixed and thus gets labeled as a ""retelling."" On February 23, 2006, Sega released a Treasure-oriented entry in their ""Sega Ages"" series for PlayStation 2. Named , it contained ""Gunstar Heroes"" prominently (to the extent of it being on the front cover), along with ""Dynamite Headdy"" and ""Alien Soldier"". ""Treasure Box"" also contains the various versions of these titles (such as Game Gear versions, versions from different countries and a Japanese prototype, which is essentially a near-final game lacking some polish and functional end stages), as well as digital manuals and other bonus materials. ""Gunstar Heroes"" was released December 11, 2006 in North America on the Wii Virtual Console and December 15, 2006 in Europe. A version for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network was released on June 10, and June 11 in 2009, respectively, with online co-op, leaderboards, and 'improved graphics' via smoothing. However both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions have reported that the co-op feature is a step backwards from the original, due to the inability to rejoin your partner upon death. Instead players must wait for their partner to also die in order for the level to start over, whereas in the original you could rejoin immediately in return for half of your partner's HP.

wikipedia-1261603," Cold trap  In vacuum applications, a cold trap is a device that condenses all vapors except the permanent gases into a liquid or solid. The most common objective is to prevent vapors being evacuated from an experiment from entering a vacuum pump where they would condense and contaminate it. Particularly large cold traps are necessary when removing large amounts of liquid as in freeze drying. Cold traps also refer to the application of cooled surfaces or baffles to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will be attached to the inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven Peltier element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity. Applications. Pumps that use oil either as their working fluid (diffusion pumps), or as their lubricant (mechanical rotary pumps), are often the sources of contamination in vacuum systems. Placing a cold trap at the mouth of such a pump greatly lowers the risk that oil vapours will backstream into the cavity. Cold traps can also be used for experiments involving vacuum lines such as small-scale very low temperature distillations/condensations. This is accomplished through the use of a coolant such as liquid nitrogen or a freezing mixture of dry ice in acetone or a similar solvent with a low melting point. When performed on a larger scale, this technique is called freeze-drying, and the cold trap is referred to as the condenser. Cold traps are also used in cryopump systems to generate hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) into their liquid or solid forms. Hazards. Care should be taken when using a cold trap not to condense liquid oxygen (a light blue liquid) into the cold trap. Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and this is especially true if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Liquid oxygen can be condensed into a cold trap if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the trap is very cold, e.g. when cooled with liquid nitrogen. Construction. Cold traps (C in the figure) usually consist of two parts: The bottom is a large, thick round tube with ground-glass joints (B in the figure), and the second is a cap (A in the figure), also with ground-glass connections. The length of the tube is usually selected so that, when assembled, the total reached is about half the length of the tube. "
wikipedia-1261604," Jonathan Culler  Jonathan Culler (born 1944) is a class of 1966 Harvard graduate and Professor of English at Cornell University; his published works are in the fields of structuralism, literary theory and criticism. Background and career. Culler attended Harvard for his undergraduate studies, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history and literature in 1966. After receiving a Rhodes scholarship, he attended St. John's College, Oxford University, where he earned a B. Phil in comparative literature (1968) and a D.Phil in modern languages (1972). His thesis for the B. Phil., on phenomenology and literary criticism, recorded Culler's first experiences with structuralism. The thesis explored the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the criticism of the ""Geneva School"" using the ideas of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Ferdinand de Saussure. Culler's ""expanded, reorganized and rewritten"" doctoral dissertation, ""Structuralism: The Development of Linguistic Models and Their Application to Literary Studies,"" became an influential prize-winning book, ""Structuralist Poetics"" (1975). Culler was Fellow in French and Director of Studies in Modern Languages at Selwyn College, Cambridge University, from 1969–1974, and Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and University Lecturer in French from 1974-77. He was Visiting Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Yale University in 1975. He is a past president of the Semiotic Society of America (1988). Currently, he is Class of 1916 Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Cornell University. Culler is married to deconstructionist critic Cynthia Chase. Major works. Culler's ""Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics and the Study of Literature"" won the James Russell Lowell Prize from the Modern Language Association of America in 1976 for an outstanding book of criticism. ""Structuralist Poetics"" was one of the first introductions to the French structuralist movement available in English. Culler’s contribution to the Very Short Introductions series, ""Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction"", received praise for its innovative technique of organization. Instead of chapters to schools and their methods, the book's eight chapters address issues and problems of literary theory. In ""The Literary in Theory"" (2007) Culler discusses the notion of Theory and literary history’s role in the larger realm of literary and cultural theory. He defines Theory as an interdisciplinary body of work including structuralist linguistics, anthropology, Marxism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and literary criticism. Contributions to critical theory. Culler believes that the linguistic-structuralist model can help “formulate the rules of particular systems of convention rather than simply affirm their existence."" He posits language and human culture as similar. In ""Structuralist Poetics"" Culler warns against applying the technique of linguistics directly to literature. Rather, the ""'grammar' of literature"" is converted into literary structures and meaning. Structuralism is defined as a theory resting on the realization that if human actions or productions have meaning there must be an underlying system that makes this meaning possible, since an utterance has meaning only in the context of a preexistent system of rules and conventions. Culler proposes that we use literary theory not to try to understand a text but rather to investigate the activity of interpretation. In several of his works, he speaks of a reader who is particularly ""competent."" In order to understand how we make sense of a text, Culler identifies common elements that different readers treat differently in different texts. He suggests there are two classes of readers, “the readers as field of experience for the critic (himself a reader)” and the future readers who will benefit from the work the critic and previous readers have done. Culler's critics complain of his lack of distinction between literature and the institution of writing in general. John R. Searle has described Culler's presentation of deconstruction as making ""Derrida look both better and worse than he really is;"" better in glossing over some of the more intellectually murky aspects of deconstruction and worse in largely ignoring the major philosophical progenitors of Derrida's thought, namely Husserl and Heidegger.

wikipedia-1261615," Rectangular function  The rectangular function (also known as the rectangle function, rect function, Pi function, gate function, unit pulse, or the normalized boxcar function) is defined as: Alternative definitions of the function define formula_2 to be 0, 1, or undefined.  Relation to the boxcar function. The rectangular function is a special case of the more general boxcar function: Where u is the Heaviside function; the function is centered at X and has duration Y, from X-Y/2 to X+Y/2. Another example is this: rect((t - (T/2)) / T ) goes from 0 to T, so in terms of Heaviside function u(t) - u((t-T) / T ) Fourier transform of the rectangular function. The unitary Fourier transforms of the rectangular function are: and: where formula_6 is the normalized form of the sinc function. Note that as long as the definition of the pulse function is only motivated by the time-domain experience of it, there is no reason to believe that the oscillatory interpretation (i.e. the Fourier transform function) should be intuitive, or directly understood by humans. However, some aspects of the theoretical result may be understood intuitively, such as the infinite bandwidth requirement incurred by the indefinitely-sharp edges in the time-domain definition. Relation to the triangular function. We can define the triangular function as the convolution of two rectangular functions: Use in probability. Viewing the rectangular function as a probability density function, it is a special case of the continuous uniform distribution with formula_8. The characteristic function is: and its moment generating function is: where formula_11 is the hyperbolic sine function. Rational approximation. The pulse function may also be expressed as a limit of a rational function: Demonstration of validity. First, we consider the case where formula_13. Notice that the term formula_14 is always positive for integer formula_15. However, formula_16 and hence formula_14 approaches zero for large formula_15. It follows that: Second, we consider the case where formula_20. Notice that the term formula_14 is always positive for integer formula_15.

wikipedia-1261616," Ophthalmoscopy  Ophthalmoscopy (funduscopy or fundoscopy) is a test that allows a health professional to see inside the fundus of the eye and other structures using an ophthalmoscope (or funduscope). It is done as part of an eye examination and may be done as part of a routine physical examination. It is crucial in determining the health of the retina and the vitreous humor. An alternative or complement to ophthalmoscopy is to perform a fundus photography, where the image can be analysed later by a professional. Types. It is of two major types:'"" Each type of ophthalmoscopy has a special type of ophthalmoscope: Indications. Ophthalmoscopy is done as part of a routine physical or complete eye examination. It is used to detect and evaluate symptoms of retinal detachment or eye diseases such as glaucoma. In patients with headaches, the finding of swollen optic discs, or papilledema, on ophthalmoscopy is a key sign, as this indicates raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which could be due to hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension (aka pseudotumor cerebri) or brain tumor, amongst other conditions. Cupped optic discs are seen in glaucoma. In patients with diabetes mellitus, regular ophthalmoscopic eye examinations (once every 6 months to 1 year) are important to screen for diabetic retinopathy as visual loss due to diabetes can be prevented by retinal laser treatment if retinopathy is spotted early. In arterial hypertension, hypertensive changes of the retina closely mimic those in the brain, and may predict cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Dilation of the pupil. To allow for better inspection through the pupil, which constricts because of light from the ophthalmoscope, it is often desirable to dilate the pupil by application of a mydriatic agent, for instance tropicamide. It is primarily considered ophthalmologist equipment. Recent developments like Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope can make good quality images though pupils as small as 2 millimeters, so dilating pupils is no longer needed with these devices. History. Dr. William Cumming in 1846 at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (later Moorfields Eye Hospital), of his pioneering work wrote ""every eye could be made luminous if the axis from a source of illumination directed towards a person's eye and the line of vision of the observer were coincident"". Although some credit the invention of the ophthalmoscope to Charles Babbage in 1847, it was not until it was independently reinvented by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1851 that its usefulness was recognized - it was to revolutionize ophthalmology. While training in France, Andreas Anagnostakis, MD, an ophthalmologist from Greece, came up with the idea of making the instrument hand-held by adding a concave mirror. Austin Barnett created a model for Anagnostakis, which he used in his practice and subsequently when presented at the first Ophthalmological Conference in Brussels in 1857, the instrument became very popular among ophthalmologists.666 666 In 1915, Francis A. Welch and William Noah Allyn invented the world's first hand-held direct illuminating ophthalmoscope, precursor to the device now used by clinicians around the world. This refinement and updating of von Helmholtz's invention enabled ophthalmoscopy to become one of the most ubiquitous medical screening techniques in the world today. The company started as a result of this invention is Welch Allyn. "
wikipedia-1261663," Mutant League Football  Mutant League Football is a video game that was released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game was designed using the ""Madden '93"" engine, and features a different take on football, where the games resemble a war as much as a sporting competition.  Electronic Arts ported the game to the PlayStation Portable as part of ""EA Replay"". It was released in the United States on November 14, 2006. The PSP allowed a higher resolution for the game than seen on the Genesis, therefore bringing greater graphics to the game when played on a television screen via the new PSP Slim & Lite's output capabilities. Gameplay. The game deviates from usual football simulations in several ways. Most notably it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where radiation has caused the human race to mutate and the dead to rise from the grave. The game instruction manual states that the exact causes of the upheaval have been lost or corrupted, due to (among many things) the chaos of an alien invasion, spin control, a sloppy filing system set up by a temp, and what appears to be barbecue sauce. Landmines, fire pits, and other hazards (such as areas being open to empty space) litter the field, which can be made of rock, ice, or even toxic waste or rubber, and players can lose health or die during the run of play (upon which they will fumble). Teams have special ""Nasty Audibles"", which are dirty (not to mention excessively violent) tricks such as exploding balls, invisibility, electric shocks, jet packs, or jumping the other quarterback with intent to kill, that lead to big gains and/or horrific casualties. Each team can ""bribe ref"" twice per game (once in each half), after which, the bought referee will call phony penalties (e.g. 5-yard penalty for crying) on the opposing team. This will last for a few plays, but the other team usually tries to kill him (one of the Nasty Audibles that can actually be played at any time) immediately after the first dirty call. A slain Ref is then replaced by an even tougher one, who will promptly call another 5-yard penalty on the murdering team for Ref Bashing. Note that accidental referee deaths, such as being caught in the middle of a pileup, or nudged into a mine, are not penalized. Gameplay can take place in the form of a pickup game or full-season mode. Winning the championship game in season mode results in the losing team exploding spontaneously, and the winning team's MVP perishing by induction into the ""Hole of Flame"", the induction ceremony of which entitles the game referees to snatch the MVP and stuff him into a firepit. Teams. Teams are composed of aliens, skeletons, robots, trolls, and superhumans. Seven players are on the field for each team, instead of the usual eleven. Many of the teams are based on real life teams, with names like the Deathskin Razors and the Midway Monsters (Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears, respectively). Players also have humorous names, like Bones Jackson (Bo Jackson), K.T. Slayer (Lawrence Taylor), Joe Magician (Joe Montana) and Scary Ice (Jerry Rice). However, despite all the death and destruction, the competition aspect is still high, and requires much strategy, especially compared to games like ""NFL Blitz"". Maniac Conference: Toxic Conference: All-Star Teams: Sequels/spin-offs. This game was followed by a spinoff entitled ""Mutant League Hockey"". A basketball game, ""Mutant League Basketball"", was in development, but it was never released. These games were also used as the basis for an animated series called ""Mutant League"", which aired from 1994 to 1996. In the Xbox 360 version of the video game ""Madden NFL 09"", there is an achievement worth 50 gamerscore entitled ""Midway Monster"". The achievement is unlocked by creating a player named ""Bones Jackson"" and placing him on the Chicago Bears. External links. Mutant Football League "
wikipedia-1261673," 7×57mm Mauser  The 7×57mm cartridge, also known as the 7 mm Mauser, 7×57mm Mauser, 7 mm Spanish Mauser in the USA and .275 Rigby in the United Kingdom, was developed by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company in 1892 and adopted as a military cartridge by Spain in 1893. It was subsequently adopted by several other countries as the standard military cartridge. It is recognised as a milestone in modern cartridge design, and although now obsolete as a military cartridge, it remains in widespread international use as a sporting round. The 7×57mm has been deservedly described as ""a ballistician's delight"". Many sporting rifles in this calibre were made by British riflemakers, among whom John Rigby was prominent; and, catering for the British preference for calibres to be designated in inches, Rigby called this chambering the .275 Rigby, after the measurement of a 7 mm rifle's bore across the lands. Military use. The Spanish military adopted a new Mauser rifle design in 1893. This took a smokeless powder centerfire cartridge with a bullet with a nominal diameter of 7 mm (0.285 in), and a case length of 57 mm - hence the names ""7×57mm Mauser"" and ""7×57mm Spanish Mauser"". It featured a long, round-nose, full metal jacketed bullet with a muzzle velocity of about with muzzle energy from a barreled rifle. For the late 19th century, these ballistics were impressive, and the loading provided a fairly flat trajectory combined with excellent penetration. At the same time, it exhibited relatively modest free recoil. That was a combination of attributes that made it popular with both soldiers and sportsmen alike. The qualities of the 7×57mm as a military round were shown in the Spanish-American War of 1898. At the commencement of the American assault on the strategic Cuban city of Santiago, 750 Spanish troops defended positions on San Juan and Kettle hills. The attacking force numbered approximately 6,600 American soldiers, most of them armed with the then-new smokeless-powder Krag-Jorgensen rifle in .30 Army caliber, and supported by artillery and Gatling gun fire. Though the assault was successful, the Americans soon realized that they had suffered more than 1,400 casualties, nearly 20 per cent of their forces. A U.S. board of investigation later concluded that the casualties were primarily due to the superior firepower of the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser rifles. During the Second Boer War in South Africa, British authorities were obliged to re-evaluate rifle and ammunition design and tactics after facing Boer sharpshooters and snipers armed with Model 1895 Mauser rifles firing 7×57mm rounds with withering effectiveness, easily outranging the .303 British cartridge as regards accurate long-range fire. The .303 cartridge at that time was still using cordite propellant, in contrast to the Mauser's higher-performance ballistite type smokeless powder. The British modernized the previous .303 British cartridge variants to the Mark 7 variant that like the 7×57mm used smokeless propellant, and updated their rifle to the Lee Enfield No. 1 Mk III. Military ammunition. The oldest 1893 pattern military ball ammunition was loaded with a long round-nosed bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel. It had a maximum range of . In 1893 this ballistic performance made it the high-performance service cartridge champion of its day when compared to other 1893 pattern smokeless-powder cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel, .303 British, and 8×50mmR Mannlicher. In 1913, following the lead of French and German Army commands in developing the ""spitzer"" or pointed-tip bullet shape, the Spanish ordnance authorities issued a redesigned 7×57mm cartridge with a spitzer bullet (""7mm Cartucho para Mauser Tipo S""). It was loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel. It had a maximum range of . The new spitzer bullet style was partially responsible for the cartridge's improved performance as it significantly reduced air drag within normal combat ranges. After that military ball ammunition loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel became available. Besides a pointed nose this projectile also had a boat tail to reduce drag. It had a maximum range of . Cartridge dimensions. The 7×57mm cartridge has 3.90 ml (60 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions. 7×57mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 20.55 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 220 mm (1 in 8.66 in), 4 grooves, diameter of lands = 6.98 mm, diameter of grooves = 7.24 mm, land width = 3.90 mm and the primer type is large rifle. European 7 mm cartridges all have 7.24 mm (0.285 in) grooves diameter. American 7 mm cartridges have 7.21 mm (0.284 in) grooves diameter. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the 7×57mm case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. The SAAMI Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure or 46,000 CUP. Although this lower specification is in deference to the purportedly weaker actions of the older Mauser 93 and 95 rifles which are still in circulation, this concern is misplaced, as the original ammunition developed for, and issued with, the M93 Spanish Mauser produced an average pressure of 50,370 CUP in those rifles. 7×57mm R (rimmed). A rimmed cartridge was developed from the 7×57 shortly after its introduction for use in break-action rifles and combination guns. A rimmed cartridge greatly simplifies the issues of designing an extractor, particularly in a combination gun or ""drilling"" which must also be designed to extract rimmed shotgun shells.  While various modern break-action and single-shot rifle and pistol designs have been developed that can reliably extract rimless cartridges, most of these date from the 1970s or later. While the external dimensions of the two versions are nearly identical other than the rim, there are differences in the internal design. In particular, the cartridge web, the area immediately above the rim on the rimmed version or the rebate on the rimless version, is thinner in the rimmed case, and some authorities recommend limiting the rimmed cartridge to 41,000 CUP because of this.  7×57mm R cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Sporting round. The ballistics of the 7×57mm became popular with deer and plains game hunters. The relatively flat trajectory and manageable recoil ensured its place as a sportsman's cartridge. The 7×57mm can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. This made it popular in Africa, where it was used on animals up to and including elephants, for which it was particularly favoured by noted ivory hunter W. D. M. Bell, who shot 1,011 elephants using a 7×57mm rifle, when most ivory hunters were using larger-caliber rifles. Bell selected the cartridge for moderate recoil, and used 11-gram military full metal jacket bullets for reliable penetration. Bell sectioned an elephant skull to determine the size and location of the brain, and used careful aim to ensure bullet placement in the brain. The 7×57 was also the favored cartridge of Eleanor O'Connor, wife of famous hunter and author Jack O'Connor. Eleanor accompanied her husband on multiple hunting expeditions all over the world, killing small and large game with the 7×57mm. Though not as popular today, the 7×57mm is still produced by most major ammunition manufacturers and many modern rifles are available chambered for the cartridge. The 7x57mm round was also used by the Indian hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett to put down the infamous man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag besides some of the other Man-Eaters of Kumaon. His writings mention using the .275 Mauser-Rigby rifle to despatch the leopard while employing it as a secondary weapon for other man-eaters, especially tigers (an Express 450/400 double-barrelled rifle being the primary). 7×57mm cartridge and rifle compatibility. In its original military loading, the 7x57mm cartridge produced an average pressure of 50,370 CUP when fired through the M93 Spanish Mauser rifle. However, SAAMI has published a Maximum Average Pressure of only 46,000 CUP for this round.  "
wikipedia-1261679," Cold urticaria  Cold Urticaria (essentially meaning ""cold hives"") is an allergy where hives (urticaria) or large red welts form on the skin after exposure to a cold stimulus. The welts are usually itchy and often the hands and feet will become itchy and swollen as well. Hives vary in size from about 7mm in diameter to as big as about 27mm diameter or larger. The disease is classified as ""chronic"" when hives appear for longer than 6 weeks; they can last for life, though their course is often unpredictable. This disorder, or perhaps two disorders with the same clinical manifestations, can be inherited (familial cold urticaria) or acquired (primary acquired cold urticaria). The acquired form is most likely to occur between ages 18–25. Types. Cold urticaria may be divided into the following types: Symptoms. When the body is exposed to the cold, hives appear. Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis.They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid. The border of a hive is described as polycyclic, or made up of many circles, and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed. Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch distinguishing it from a bruise or papule. Hives can last for a few minutes or a few days, and vary from person to person. Also a burning sensation occurs. During a severe reaction, hypotension, which can be life-threatening, can occur. A serious reaction is most likely to occur if the hives occur with less than 3 minutes of exposure (during a cold test). Cause. The hives are a histamine reaction in response to cold stimuli, including a drastic drop in temperature, cold air, and cold water. There are many causes for cold hives, most are idiopathic (meaning they have no known cause). Some rare conditions can cause cold hives, and it can be useful to test for these conditions if the cold hives are in any way unusual. Diagnosis. Diagnosis is typically obtained by an allergist or other licensed practitioner performing a cold test. During the cold test, a piece of ice is held against the forearm, typically for 2–3 minutes. A positive result is a specific looking mark of raised red hives. The hives may be the shape of the ice, or it may radiate from the contact area of the ice. Treatment. The most important treatment is to stay warm. Some air conditioned rooms and pools may be too cold for the skin. Warming up immediately after exposure to cold temperatures usually helps control the hives before they get worse. Although the hives do not instantaneously disappear after warming the affected area(s), warming up afterwards reduces the time it takes for the hives to go away. Some patients report that spreading butter or vegetable shortening on their affected areas reduces the risk of future eruptions. Allergy medications containing antihistamines such as Benadryl, Zyrtec, Claritin, Periactin and Allegra may be taken orally to prevent and relieve some of the hives (depending on the severity of the allergy). There are also topical antihistamine creams which are used to help relieve hives in other conditions, but there is not any documentation stating it will relieve hives induced by cold temperature. Please note, however, it is not often that antihistamines work for cases like Cold Urticaria. Cold hives can result in a potentially serious, or even fatal, systemic reaction (anaphylactic shock). People with cold hives may have to carry an injectable form of epinephrine (like Epi-pen or Twinject) for use in the event of a serious reaction.  The best treatment for this allergy is avoiding exposure to cold temperature. Ebastine has been proposed as an approach to prevent acquired cold urticaria. "
wikipedia-1261697," Patrick Lachman  Patrick Lachman (born March 31, 1970) is an American heavy metal guitarist and vocalist. Biography. The Portland, Oregon native was a short-lived member of Dr. Mastermind, featuring former Wild Dogs vocalist Matt McCourt, before joining his brother, vocalist Tim Lachman, in another local band, Gargoyle, in 1988. Gargoyle would move to Los Angeles, California in 1990 where the band morphed into State Of The Art recording an acclaimed 3-song demo before disbanding in 1993. The Lachman brothers next hooked up with Canada native Shane Gaalaas, then the drummer for Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen, and recorded another demo under the name Eleventh Hour. In 1996, Lachman and Gaalaas teamed up with former Last Rites and World In Pain members A.J. Cavalier (later to join Soil) and Jeff Mohr to form Diesel and cut a 6-song demo. Parting ways with Mohr and adding Rich Gonzales, formerly with Recipients Of Death, on bass, the band would change their name to Diesel Machine in time for the release of their debut album, ""Torture Test"", in 2001. By then Lachman had already been picked as one of the guitar players for Halford, the solo band of then ex-Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford. With Halford, Lachman co-wrote and recorded ""Resurrection"" (2000), ""Live Insurrection"" (2001), and another studio album, ""Crucible"" (2002). Lachman also collaborated with Tommy Victor of Prong on the song 'Initiation' which appeared on the band's 2002 ""100% Live"" album and was re-recorded as 'Embrace the Depth' for ""Scorpio Rising"". 2003 saw the release of a Halford EP titled ""Fourging The Furnace"", released in Japan only. That same year Rob Halford announced that he would return to Judas Priest. Lachman had already left the Halford band in November 2002 to join former Pantera guitarist ""Dimebag Darrell"" Abbott and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott, in a new band called Damageplan as their vocalist. Their debut album, ""New Found Power"", was released in 2004; in addition, the song 'Ashes to Ashes', featuring Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains, appeared on """" soundtrack. The band had recorded several songs for a second album, however on December 8, 2004 during a Damageplan show at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, Darrell was fatally shot on stage by 25-year-old mentally ill ex-Marine Nathan Gale, who was shot and killed by police officer James Niggemeyer minutes later. After the untimely demise of Damageplan, Lachman put together a new band called The Mercy Clinic in 2005 with guitarists Brian Harrah (Professional Murder Music) and Josh Stinson (Drist), bassist Steed Najera (Triple Seven), and drummer Bevan Davies (Danzig, Comes With The Fall, Jerry Cantrell). Over the course of the next couple of years the group would write and demo upwards of 20 songs and played frequent shows in the L.A. area but ultimately failed to land a record deal. Subsequently, the project was put on hold. On February 18, 2005 Lachman performed with the surviving members of Alice in Chains at a benefit for tsunami relief in Seattle, Washington filling in for their late lead singer Layne Staley along with fellow vocalists Maynard James Keenan (Tool), Wes Scantlin (Puddle of Mudd), and Ann Wilson (Heart). Lachman filled in for Killswitch Engage's guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz on the band's North American tour in early 2007. He also filled in for Dutkiewicz at Download Festival 2007. In 2009, Lachman began working with Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers formerly of Fear Factory under the name Burn It All. He also continues work on a second Diesel Machine album.

wikipedia-1261718," Kristen Pfaff  Kristen Marie Pfaff (May 26, 1967 – June 16, 1994) was an American musician, best known as the bassist for alternative rock band Hole from 1993 to 1994.  Early life and career. Pfaff was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, attending Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart. She spent a short time in Europe and briefly attended Boston College before ultimately finishing at the University of Minnesota. She studied classical piano and cello. While living in Minneapolis, Minnesota following her graduation, Pfaff taught herself to play bass guitar. She, guitarist/vocalist Joachim Breuer (formerly of Minneapolis band the Bastards) and drummer Matt Entsminger formed the band Janitor Joe. Janitor Joe. The band's first single, ""Hmong"", was released on the nascent OXO records imprint in 1992, and popular local label Amphetamine Reptile Records picked up the band later that year, releasing the ""Bullethead"" single on picture disc, and following up in 1993 with the ""Boyfriend"" 7-inch and the debut album ""Big Metal Birds"". One Janitor Joe track, ""Under The Knife"", can also be found on an OXO records 4-track EP, released in 1993.  Janitor Joe were becoming a staple of the Minneapolis sound, influenced by the Pacific Northwest's early grunge sound and by the sharper, faster DC post-hardcore scene, as well as the stop-start distortion of the Butthole Surfers, Shellac and others on the Touch and Go label. Pfaff's playing style was central to Janitor Joe's relentless assault both live and on record, and she and Breuer both contributed songs to ""Big Metal Birds"": ""Both operate within easy reach of the line separating punishment and reward: Pfaff's contributions (the surly ""Boys in Blue"") tend to be slightly more spacious, while Breuer's (""One Eye,"" for instance) stipulate that drummer Matt Entsminger maintain perpetual motion"", wrote David Sprague of Trouser Press. The growing Minneapolis scene was beginning to attract music press attention in 1993. Amphetamine Reptile released a tour single, ""Stinker"", and Janitor Joe began to tour nationally. It was on one such tour in California that year that Pfaff was scouted by Eric Erlandson and Courtney Love of Hole, who were at the time looking for a new bassist. Love invited Pfaff to play with Hole; Pfaff declined and returned to Minneapolis, but Erlandson and Love continued to pursue her. Hole. Pfaff, initially reluctant to leave Minneapolis and join Hole, reconsidered after advice from her father, Norman: ""From a professional point of view, there was no decision"", he later told ""Seattle Weekly"", ""because they're already on Geffen Records and already have this huge following in England... if you're wanting to move up the ladder, that's the way to go."" Following international critical acclaim for their first, independent album, ""Pretty On The Inside"", Hole had generated a great deal of major-label interest, eventually signing an eight-album deal with Geffen Records for a reported $3 million. In 1993, Pfaff moved to Seattle, Washington, to work with the other members of Hole on ""Live Through This"", the major-label follow-up to ""Pretty On The Inside"". The band's new line-up – Love, Erlandson, Pfaff and Patty Schemel on drums – entered the studio in early 1993 to begin rehearsals. ""That's when we took off,"" Eric Erlandson said of Pfaff joining. ""All of a sudden we became a real band."" Seattle and after. Pfaff's time in Seattle was a creatively rich period, and she formed close friendships with Eric Erlandson, and Kurt Cobain. While working on the platinum selling album ""Live Through This"", Pfaff and Erlandson dated, and stayed together for most of 1993, remaining close even after splitting up. All was not well, however; while living in Washington's 'heroin capital', Pfaff developed a problem with drug use. ""Everybody was doing it. Everyone, everyone. All our friends were junkies. It was ridiculous. Everybody in this town did dope"", said Love of this period in the Seattle music scene. By most accounts, Pfaff's own drug use was relatively moderate: ""Kristen...dabbled in drugs before she was in our band, in Minneapolis, but it was very light"", Erlandson told Craig Marks of ""Spin"". ""She moved to Seattle and felt disconnected from everything, and she made friends, drug connections, which I told her not to do. The only way you can survive in this town is if you don't make those connections.""  Pfaff entered rehab for heroin addiction in the winter of 1993, and took a sabbatical from Hole in spring 1994, to tour with Janitor Joe. ""She went on tour... and when she came back from that, she was clean"", says Erlandson. Soon after her return, her friend Kurt Cobain died in April 1994. In the wake of Cobain's death, Pfaff decided to leave Hole and Seattle, and return to Minneapolis to rejoin Janitor Joe permanently. Death. Her father, Norman Pfaff, described her as ""bright, personable, wonderful...very, very talented, smart, and she always seemed to be in control of her circumstances. Last night she wasn't."" As a musician who died at the age of 27, she has become part of the phenomenon known as the 27 Club. In the book ""Love & Death"", released April 2004, Kristen Pfaff's mother, Janet Pfaff, states she has never accepted the official story regarding her daughter's death. Janet was interviewed by authors Wallace and Halperin in August 2003. Kristen Pfaff was buried in Section 6, Lot 45 of Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. Posthumous achievements. A local Minneapolis radio station, University of Minnesota's KUOM, had started a yearly $1,000 Memorial Scholarship in her name. The award is earmarked for ""individuals active in the arts in the pursuit of their educational goals."" Portions from the proceeds of Hole's album sales have gone to the Kristen Pfaff Memorial Fund.  On October 20, 1994, Janet Pfaff, Kristen's mother, accepted induction on her daughter's behalf into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame. ""I'm proud to accept this award for Kristen and I know she would be happy to receive it,"" Mrs. Pfaff said. ""It's sad because Kristen wasn't here herself to enjoy the moment. You work so hard in the business to make it at the national level, and that's what Kristen did. I just wish she was here to enjoy it, and see how her hometown feels about her."" After a period of mourning, Hole recruited Canadian bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and dedicated their first show of an extensive touring period to Pfaff. Hole's 1997 retrospective compilation ""My Body, the Hand Grenade"" is also dedicated to her. "
wikipedia-1261730," Vengaboys  Vengaboys are a Eurodance pop group based in Amsterdam. The brainchild of two Dutch producers Wessel van Diepen and Dennis van den Driesschen (Danski and Delmundo), they enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s. Their music was ubiquitous throughout European holiday destinations. They are best known for their two UK number one singles, ""Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!"" and ""We're Going to Ibiza"" and their U.S. Top 40 hit, ""We Like to Party"". The group consists of lead vocalist Kim Sasabone, vocalist Denise Post-Van Rijswijk and the male dancers Robin Pors and Donny Latupeirissa. They have sold an estimated 15 million records worldwide and are renowned for being one of the most influential Eurodance pop groups of the early 21st century. On 2 May 2001, The World Music Awards awarded Vengaboys with the award for best selling dance group of the year. History. 1997–1998: Formation and ""Up & Down - The Party Album!"". Dutch producers Danski and Delmundo initially found success organizing illegal beach parties during the summers. Danski and Delmundo recruited background singers Rachael Carpenter and Olivia Ovington, fronted by singer Kim Sasabone for the music videos, to form a group In 1997. The name Vengaboys was thought up during a recording session for another of Danski and Delmundo's projects, called Nakatomi. The group recorded several single tracks such as their two small Benelux hits ""Parada De Tettas"" and ""To Brazil"", which were released as singles before the release of the tracks as a debut album titled ""Up & Down - The Party Album!"" in the Netherlands. 1998–1999: Second Line-up and Re-Release of ""The Party Album!"". In 1998, with the addition of the three new members Denise Post-Van Rijswijk, Roy den Burger and Robin Pors to current member Kim Sasabone, the now four piece, they entered the UK chart at number 4 with ""Up and Down"" and their follow-up ""We Like to Party"" peaked at number 1 in Belgium, was a Top 10 hit in other European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It reached number 26 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. Vengaboys re-released their debut album re-titled ""The Party Album"" featuring new tracks. In June 1999, ""Boom Boom Boom Boom"" topped the charts in the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands. ""We Like to Party"" was used in a Six Flags advertisement campaign in America, featuring an elderly gent dancing to the tune and picking up passengers. ""The Party Album!"" soared to the top of the charts in over 20 countries including the U.K., Canada, Germany, Benelux, Spain, South Africa, Thailand, Poland, Australia and Mexico. ""We're Going to Ibiza"", a reworking of Typically Tropical's 1975 number 1 hit ""Barbados"", also reached the top slot in September 1999. Their debut LP spent 30 consecutive weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified gold (500,000 units) in November 1999. ""The Party Album!"" was once again released under a new name, this time known as ""Greatest Hits - Part 1"", which featured five new songs. ""The Remix Album"" was released in late 1999, featuring new dance remixes of the songs from the Vengaboys' debut record. 2000–2002: ""The Platinum Album"", Line-up changes and Hiatus. Shortly before the release of their second album, Robin Pors left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by dolphin trainer Yorick Bakker ""The Platinum Album"" was released in early 2000, which saw continued success for the group. More UK and Canadian Top 10 hits followed: ""Kiss (When the Sun Don't Shine)"", ""Shalala Lala"" and ""Uncle John from Jamaica"" all charted, with the former going to number one on the Irish Charts. For their fourth single, the group gained a virtual member, the computer-animated Cheekah. The single ""Cheekah Bow Bow (That Computer Song)"" was not as successful as their previous singles. They released their single ""Forever as One"" in February 2001 with little promotion. The single charted at 28 in the UK, making it their worst-performing single. Shortly after this release, they replaced Denise Post-Van Rijswijk, who was pregnant, with Lynn Allien and Yorick Bakker with Mark Jong a Pin and released a solo single. The group eventually disbanded for several years. Owing to the fact this fourth line-up did not last long and resulted in no new material, Lynn Allien and Mark Jong a Pin have never been officially recognized as former Vengaboys members. 2006–2009: Return on Stage, Line-up changes and new material. In 2006 they returned to the club scene with new member Donny Latupeirissa a.k.a. Ma'Donny, replacing Roy den Burger as Cowboy and Robin Pors returning to the group replacing Yorick Bakker. They have most recently been touring university student union clubs in the UK and Ireland, most notably the UCD 2010 Ball, with an estimated 9000 attendees. Throughout 2008 and 2009, the group continued to tour on a small scale, while various rumors of new tracks including ""Partylife"" in 2008 and a re-release of old material in 2009 generated publicity. 2010–present: Comeback, Best of and New Single. In the spring of 2010, The Vengaboys confirmed via their website, Twitter and at their live gigs that their comeback single will be called ""Rocket To Uranus"" and feature singer-songwriter Pete Burns and American celebrity Perez Hilton, who co-wrote the song. It was only released in their home country in June 2010. The world premiere was confirmed via the band's Twitter account, announcing the premiere on 4 June on the Dutch radio station Radio 538. The video premiered on 6 June at the Dutch television station TMF, and in 2D and 3D formats on their own website and YouTube channel. They were due to release a Best of in Australia on 9 December 2011. JJ Van Zon replaced Donny Latupeirissa for a short time as the Cowboy. November 2012 Donny returned to the group to reclame his role as Cowboy. Also in 2012, Vengaboys began performing a cover of T-Spoons song ""Sex On The Beach"" in their live shows, but it is unknown if the song will be released officially by Vengaboys in the future. In early April 2013, It has been announced through their official Twitter and Facebook pages that a new music video is in the works. The latest single will be entitled ""Hot Hot Hot"", a cover of the 1983 hit originally by 'Arrow' as small hints of the song was posted on their Twitter account. The song will be released on 8 July 2013, no international release has been announced yet. The song was performed during their National Tour in Australia back in January and live footage of the track has been uploaded via YouTube. Also Kim Sasabone announced that she has become pregnant. As of July 25, ""Hot Hot Hot"" was released with an unsuspected announcement on their Official Facebook and Twitter pages. The single features 16 remixes.

wikipedia-1261758," Lauren Etame Mayer  Laureano Bisan-Etame Mayer (born 19 January 1977 in Kribi), commonly known as Lauren, is a retired Cameroonian footballer of Equatoguinean origin, who formerly played for the Cameroonian national team. As an Arsenal player he won several trophies and is known as one of the 'Invincibles'; a title given to the Arsenal squad in 2004, after they went the whole (2003–04) season undefeated and subsequently won the Premier League title. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics with Cameroon. Club career. Early career. Lauren was born in Cameroon as his parents fled Equatorial Guinea, due to the political persecution during the dictatorship of Francisco Macías Nguema. Then the family moved to Seville, where he was raised. He started his career in Spain, playing for Utrera, (on loan from Sevilla), San Fernando, Sevilla, Levante, and Mallorca. He qualified for dual nationality through residency and as a Spaniard, he is exempt from the post-Bosman ruling regulation that restricts the number of non-EU players to three per team in UEFA competition matches even though he is a Cameroonian international. Arsenal. In Summer 2000, Lauren was transferred to Arsenal for a fee of £7.2 million. Lauren provided cover for both midfield or defence. He made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Sunderland on 19 August 2000 and scored his first goal for the club just two days later against Liverpool. However his first season was blighted by injuries. Although at first Lauren was unable to gain a regular place in the Arsenal side, he eventually ended up becoming the club's first-choice right back, replacing Lee Dixon and leapfrogging Oleh Luzhny in the process. By the time Arsenal had won the Double in 2001–02, Lauren was an integral part of the Arsenal defence. In 2002–03, Lauren suffered a calf injury and again missed part of the season, but nevertheless recovered in time and won an FA Cup winners medal that season, as Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0. Lauren was a consistent member of the Arsenal first team during 2003–04 and a became known as one of the 'Invincibles' after the club went the whole season unbeaten. Lauren made his 150th appearance for Arsenal during the record breaking run and Arsenal won the Premier League title, giving Lauren his second League winners' medal. His season was however slightly marred by his verbal abuse towards Ruud van Nistelrooy after he had missed a penalty late on in the match between the two sides at Old Trafford. Lauren was banned by The Football Association for four matches and fined £40,000. Lauren won a third FA Cup winners' medal in 2005, as Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties after a 0–0 draw in the final; Lauren scored the first of Arsenal's spot-kicks. However, during 2005–06, Lauren suffered a knee injury against Wigan Athletic in a League Cup semi-final match on 21 January 2006. He spent nearly a year out of the game as a result, and it was not until 19 December that Lauren was included in a playing squad, for Arsenal's match against Liverpool in the League Cup quarter-finals; this match was later postponed due to heavy fog. Lauren was not called up for Arsenal again. During his absence, Lauren's position had been covered by, amongst others, Emmanuel Eboué and Justin Hoyte, leading to media speculation that Lauren would leave Arsenal for West Ham United. On 12 January 2007, Wenger confirmed Arsenal would allow Lauren to leave, if he chose to do so. On 18 January 2007, Lauren joined Portsmouth on a two-and a half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Portsmouth. On 18 January 2007, Lauren completed a transfer to Portsmouth on a two and a half-year contract. On 22 January, Harry Redknapp announced the transfer fee was £500,000. Lauren made his debut on 20 January 2007 against Charlton Athletic and was a regular at right back for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. In the 2007–08 season, he dropped to second choice right back due to Glen Johnson's impressive form. However, Lauren found first team opportunities due to his versatility and filled in at left back on many occasions and played regularly on the right of midfield during January 2008 while John Utaka was away at the African Cup of Nations. In June 2009, his contract ended and he was released from the club having made just one appearance all season, as a substitute in the 2008 FA Community Shield. Cordoba. On 15 March 2010, Córdoba announced that they had signed Lauren as a free agent. He made his league debut as a substitute for Arteaga on 3 April 2010 in a 0–0 away draw against Huesca. Lauren retired at the end of the season. International career. During the 1997–98 season, whilst he was playing at Levante, Thomas N'Kono learnt of his selectability by Cameroon due to his birth. He was invited to join the squad that played in the 1998 World Cup and rose to the challenge. Lauren earned his first full international cap for Cameroon in May 1998 against Luxembourg. Unfortunately, his debut in the tournament as a substitute was blighted by one of the fastest sending offs in the history of the World Cup, when in his first challenge for the ball he was shown a red card, thus ending his World Cup campaign. Better times were ahead though, playing in the Cameroon team that won the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations. He also played in the gold winning team at the 2000 Olympics, ironically against Spain, who could have selected him were it not for his choice of Cameroon. This success was repeated when the team won the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations; Cameroon beat Senegal on penalties after a 0–0 draw. Lauren scored in the penalty shootout. He also played in the 2002 World Cup group stages, featuring in all three of Cameroon's group matches, but his side failed to qualify for the knockout stage. He retired from international football in 2002, having won 25 caps for his country. Personal life. Lauren is an occasional pundit alongside Guillem Balagué on Sky Sports' La Liga programme, ""Revista de la Liga"". He was also a pundit for ITV4 during their coverage of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. He is also an avid boxer and enjoys sparring in his spare time. He lives in Seville, and has one child. In November 2011, Lauren's Rolex Daytona watch was found and returned after six years by police after raids in Essex and East London. "

wikipedia-1261767," Chlorophytum comosum  Chlorophytum comosum, often called the spider plant or airplane plant, is a flowering perennial herb. It is native to tropical and southern Africa, but has become naturalized in other parts of the world, including western Australia and San Francisco, California. Variegated forms in particular are used as houseplants. Description. ""Chlorophytum comosum"" grows to about high. It has fleshy, tuberous roots, about long. The long narrow leaves reach a length of and are around wide. Flowers are produced in a long branched inflorescence, which can reach a length of up to and eventually bends downwards. Flowers initially occur in clusters of 1–6 at intervals along the stem (scape) of the inflorescence. Each cluster is at the base of a bract, which ranges from in length, becoming smaller towards the end of the inflorescence. Most of the flowers which are produced initially die off, so that the inflorescences are relatively sparsely flowered. Individual flowers are greenish-white, borne on stalks (pedicels) some long. Each flower has six three-veined tepals which are long, slightly hooded or boat-shaped at their tips. The stamens consist of a pollen-producing anther about long with a filament about the same length or slightly longer. The central style is long. Seeds are produced in a capsule long on stalks (pedicels) which lengthen to up to . The inflorescences carry plantlets at the tips of their branches. The stems (scapes) of the inflorescence are called ""stolons"" in some sources, but this term is more correctly used for stems which do not bear flowers, and have roots at the nodes. Taxonomy. ""Chlorophytum comosum"" was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg as ""Anthericum comosum"" in the 1794 volume of ""Prodromus Plantarum Capensium"", Thunberg's work on the plants of South Africa. It was subsequently moved to a number of different genera, including ""Phalangium"", ""Caesia"", ""Hartwegia"" Nees and ""Hollia"", before receiving its current placement in ""Chlorophytum"" by Jacques in 1862. The species has been confused with ""Chlorophytum capense"" (L.) Voss by some authors, but this is a different species. Intra-specific variation. There are three described varieties of the species: the autonym ""C. comosum"" var. ""comosum"" has strap-shaped narrow leaves and is found along forest margins, ""C. comosum"" var. ""bipindense"" has broader, petiolate leaves with stripes on the underside and the inflorescences are 2-3 times the length of the leaves, and ""C. comosum"" var. ""sparsiflorum"" also has broader leaves that narrow to the base and usually lacks a petiole and the striping on the underside of the leaf and the inflorescences are up to two times the length of the leaves. The latter two are rain forest-dwelling taxa that had earlier been described as separate species, but botanists Axel Dalberg Poulsen and Inger Nordal reduced the taxa to varieties of ""C. comosum"" in 2005. Delimitation of species boundaries within the genus ""Chlorophytum"" is reported to be difficult, possibly because of several evolutionary radiations into forest environments that led to morphological aspects that are too similar to reliably distinguish separate species. The evidence given to support this is the widespread distribution of most taxa in the genus and poor seed dispersal, leading to the conclusion of deeper evolutionary divergence among the taxa. The three described varieties in ""C. comosum"" could be an example of this convergent evolution of leaf shape among the forest-dwelling varieties from species of disparate origin, leading to the species ""C. comosum"" being polyphyletic, instead of the traditional view of morphological divergence among the varieties within the species with the assumption of a common origin (monophyly). The widespread ""C. comosum"" var. ""comosum"" has slender, near linear leaves that lack a petiole similar to plants found in cultivation and is only found growing at the margins of the rain forest. The two other varieties, ""C. comosum"" var. ""sparsiflorum"" and ""C. comosum"" var. ""bipindense"", possess petioles and have broader leaves necessary for collecting more light in the shady Guineo-Congolean rain forest. A study published in 2005 used 16 morphological characters and was unable to delimit species boundaries among these three taxa, so they were relegated to varietal status. A follow-up study published in 2008 provided preliminary evidence from phylogenetic analysis of plastid and nuclear DNA sequences that established samples from disparate collections sites identified as ""C. comosum"" were polyphyletic. Cultivation. ""Chlorophytum comosum"" is a popular houseplant. The species, with all-green leaves, forms only a small proportion of plants sold. More common are two variegated cultivars: Both cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Spider plants are easy to grow, being able to thrive in a wide range of conditions. They will tolerate temperatures down to , but grow best at temperatures between and . Plants can be damaged by high fluoride or boron levels. Spider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution in the form of formaldehyde, and approximately 15 plants would neutralize formaldehyde production in a representative energy-efficient house.

wikipedia-1261779," Gholam-Hossein Banan  Gholām-Hossein Banān () (May, 1911, Amol — February 27, 1986, Gholhak, Tehran) was an Iranian musician and singer. He was born into a musical family. His father, Karim Khān Banān ol-Douleh Nurí (كريم خان بنان الدوله نوري), was a musician (and calligrapher), was an accomplished pianist; one brother and two sisters also played the tar as pupils of the renowned musician Morteza Neydāvood. From the age of six Gholam-Hossein Banān began to take lessons in singing and playing the piano and organ through the encouragement of Morteza Neydāvood (مرتضي ني داود) who was quick to recognize him as musically talented. Gholām-Hossein's first teachers were his parents. He subsequently studied with Mirzā Tāher Ziā oz-Zākerin Rasā'í (ميرزا طاهر ضياء ذاكرين رثايي) and Nāser Seif (ناصر سيف). Ali-Naqi Vaziri later introduced him to the acclaimed Rouhollah Khāleghi. Banān joined the Iranian National Music Association in 1942, and appeared on Iranian National Radio that same year. He then joined the orchestra of the distinguished pianist Javād Maroufi, becoming the lead vocalist. In 1957 or 1958, (1336 AH) Banān became blind in his right eye following a car accident.

wikipedia-1261801," Rumford fireplace  The Rumford fireplace is a tall, shallow fireplace designed by Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, an Anglo-American physicist who was known for his investigations of heat. Rumford applied his knowledge of heat to the improvement of fireplaces. He made them smaller and shallower with widely angled covings so they would radiate better. And he streamlined the throat, or in his words ""rounded off the breast"" so as to ""remove those local hindrances which forcibly prevent the smoke from following its natural tendency to go up the chimney..."" Rumford wrote two papers detailing his improvements on fireplaces in 1796 and 1798. He was well known and widely read in his lifetime and almost immediately in the 1790s his ""Rumford fireplace"" became state-of-the-art worldwide. Subsequent testing of Rumford's designs has shown that their efficiency would qualify them as clean-burning stoves. Today, with the extensive restoration of old and historic houses and the renewed popularity of early American and classical architecture in new construction, Rumford fireplaces are enjoying a comeback. Rumford fireplaces are generally appreciated for their tall classic elegance and their heating efficiency. Principle of action. The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. He and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. It effectively produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering and often choking the residents. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions, and became smoke-free as well as more efficient. Thompson became a celebrity when news of his success became widespread. In an age when fires were the principal source of heat, this simple alteration in the design of fireplaces was copied everywhere .  Usage. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Count Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. There are still many original Rumford fireplaces, often buried behind newer renovations. He also invented a cast iron stove, also known as the Rumford stove, which competed successfully with the famous Benjamin Franklin stove. Both devices gave much more control over the air flow into the fire, and were both much more efficient users of fuel. Such stoves were expensive, but saved so much fuel as to justify the cost of installation very quickly. They in turn inspired the development of the kitchen range, also made in cast iron, which gave yet more control of the fire and also was used directly for cooking purposes. "

wikipedia-1261825," Büchner funnel  A Büchner funnel is a piece of laboratory equipment used in filtration. It is traditionally made of porcelain, but glass and plastic funnels are also available. On top of the funnel-shaped part there is a cylinder with a perforated plate separating it from the funnel. The Hirsch funnel has a similar design; it is used similarly, but for smaller quantities of material. The main difference is that the plate is much smaller, while the walls of the funnel angle outward instead of being vertical. The filtration material, usually filter paper, is placed on the plate, and the filter paper is moistened with a solvent to prevent initial leakage. The liquid to be filtered is poured into the cylinder and drawn through the perforated plate by vacuum suction. The main advantage in using this type of filtration is that it proceeds much more quickly (several orders of magnitude) than simply allowing the solvent to drain through the filter medium via the force of gravity. It is essential that the amount of solvent being used be limited to less than what would overflow the flask, otherwise the solvent will be drawn into the vacuum equipment. If the vacuum is provided by a water flow device, an overflow of the solvent could result in the spilling of a hazardous solvent into the wastewater stream, a potential violation of the law, depending on the solvent. The potential for overflow and the potential for water to be drawn back into the flask can be reduced by using a trap between the flask and the vacuum source. It is used in organic chemistry labs to assist in collecting recrystallized compounds. The suction allows the wet recrystallized compound to dry out such that the pure dried crystal compound is left remaining. However, it is often the case that further drying is required, by an oven or other means, in order to remove as much residual solvent as possible. It is often used in combination with a Büchner flask, Büchner ring and sinter seals. A vacuum tight seal and stability of the Büchner flask and filter are essential during the filtration process. A Büchner ring can be used with Büchner funnels, flasks, glass crucibles and gooch crucibles. The wide flange and large surface contact ensures an excellent vacuum tight seal whilst the rings are easy to remove and offer excellent support to even the largest funnels. It is commonly thought to be named for the Nobel Laureate, Eduard Buchner (without umlaut), but it is actually named for the industrial chemist Ernst Büchner. "
wikipedia-1261838," Edu Gaspar  Eduardo César Daude Gaspar (born 15 May 1978), commonly known as Edu or Edu Gaspar, is a retired Brazilian footballer who is currently director of football at his former club Corinthians. Club career. Early career. Edu started his career in the Campeonato Brasileiro with one of the Brazil´s biggest teams, Corinthians. While at Corinthians, Edu won the 1998 and 1999 Brasileiro championships, and the 2000 World Club Championship. Arsenal. After initially planning to join Arsenal in 2000, his transfer was put on hold after it was realized that he was in possession of a fake Portuguese passport. Months later, after qualifying for an European Union (EU) passport (aided by Italian lineage on his father's side), he signed for Arsenal on 16 January 2001 for £6 million. He had a turbulent time early on as his sister was killed in a car accident. His Arsenal debut came in 2001 in a goalless draw tarnished by an injury after 15 minutes against Leicester City. He had replaced Freddie Ljungberg at half time only for himself to be replaced by Dennis Bergkamp minutes later. It was an unfortunate start and he only managed to play in four more matches for the club during that season, one of which was a 0-3 defeat at home to Middlesbrough in which he contributed an own goal. His first goal for the club came against Grimsby in the League Cup on 27 November 2001. He went on to make a substitute appearance in the 2002 FA Cup Final as Arsenal emerged victorious. Many people believe that he was unlucky because, a year later, he was not selected to play for Brazil's 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, but during the overlapping 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, he aided Arsenal to great heights. Seen as his finest season so far in football, his 2003–04 season in midfield for Arsenal was capped by one of five goals against Italian Serie A side Internazionale in a 5–1 Arsenal victory. Edu then put forward plans to play for England in the World Cup (as he had gained British citizenship) were Brazil not willing to accept his placement. This was cancelled by April as he was handed a match against Chile and subsequently named to play in the Copa América in 2004. He made his 100th appearance for Arsenal during the 2003–04 season and, having once looked like a permanent member of the club, it became increasingly clear he would leave no later than the end of the 2004–05 season, when his contract ran out. Edu enjoyed mixed fortunes in the 2004–05 season. He missed the start of the season because he was away with Brazil at the Copa América. This was followed by speculation over his future at the club as he was in the last year of his contract with Arsenal. Talks with Valencia of Spain in January 2005 failed as the Mestalla outfit were not able to pay the fee Arsenal demanded. Edu only scored two goals for Arsenal in 2004–05 – one was a fine chip in the 2–0 away win at West Bromwich Albion in May 2005, and the other a penalty kick in a 7–0 demolition of Everton in 2005. He did however come on as an extra time substitute as Arsenal won the 2005 FA Cup Final. Valencia. In May 2005, it was confirmed that he would leave Arsenal in the summer on a Bosman ruling free transfer. Valencia, Juventus, Internazionale, and Barcelona were hot favorites to secure the signature of Edu, and on 30 May, Valencia announced it had signed him to a five-year deal. Shortly after signing, Edu suffered a pre-season injury that ruled him out of first-team action until 4 April 2006, when he made his debut in the 5–3 victory over Cádiz. On 3 July 2009, the Brazilian midfielder left Valencia through contractual termination. Corinthians. After being released in Spain, Edu signed a contract with his former club Corinthians on 6 August 2009, to last until 31 December 2011. After playing just four matches during the 2010 season, his contract was terminated by mutual consent, and Edu announced his retirement from professional football. International career. Edu initially considered playing for the English national team upon gaining a British passport as he did not think he would be picked for Brazil. He finally got a call-up to the Brazilian national team in 2004 and made his debut on 28 April 2004 in a friendly match against Hungary. He also played for them in the Copa América 2004, which Brazil won. The following year, he also played in 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, which Brazil also won. Post-playing career. On 17 March 2011, Corinthians announced that Edu would take over from William Machado as the club's director of football. Personal life.

wikipedia-1261839," Sensurround  Sensurround is the brand name for a process developed by Cerwin-Vega in conjunction with Universal Studios to enhance the audio experience during film screenings, specifically for the 1974 film ""Earthquake"". The process was intended for subsequent use and was adopted for three more films, ""Midway"" (1976), ""Rollercoaster"" (1977) and the theatrical version of ""Saga of a Star World"" (1978), the ""Battlestar Galactica"" pilot. Sensurround worked by adding extended-range bass for sound effects. The low-frequency sounds were more felt than heard, providing a vivid complement to onscreen depictions of earth tremors, bomber formations, and amusement park rides. The overall trend toward ""multiplex"" cinema structures presented challenges that made Sensurround impractical as a permanent feature of cinema. Sensurround helped bring wider recognition to established loudspeaker manufacturer Cerwin-Vega, and aided in establishing a strong reputation for new audio amplifier company BGW Systems. The increased awareness of extended low-frequency sound reproduction that Sensurround brought to film audiences was a factor in the increase in subwoofer sales and in the rise in the number of subwoofer designs in the late 1970s and 1980s. Development. Original design. Sensurround involved the installation of large, low frequency, horn-loaded speakers which contained specially designed 18-inch Cerwin-Vega Model 189 E drivers in custom black wood cabinets. Three horn configurations were available, Model-C (Corner), Model-W (Folded Bass Bin) and Model-M (Modular). The Model-C and -M horns required stacking in groups of four, increasing effective horn mouth size to achieve the low frequency target. They came with special extenders used to widen the mouths of the horns and take advantage of the theater walls to further increase low frequency extension. The Model-M horn had a dedicated ""Mouth-Extender"" available when it was used in the front of the theater. While installation was customized and varied in each theater, the Sensurround horns were typically placed beneath the screen in front and in the back corners of the theater. Often, rows or sections of seats would have to be removed to make room for the large Sensurround horns. In large theaters, up to 20 individual horns might be used along with custom-built bat wings and mouth extenders. The original Sensurround design used for ""Earthquake"" employed a pseudorandom noise generator, designed by D. Broadus ""Don"" Keele, Jr., to create the low-frequency rumble, with the waveform matching that of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film's mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency pseudorandom noise to 1,600 watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers. The control box generated a pseudorandom noise signal with energy between 17 and 120 Hz. The control track method was employed because there was no way to accurately record bass lower than 40 Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time. When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 110 dB at the center of the theater to a maximum of 120 dB measured 4 feet in front of any horn. The resulting rumble could be ""felt"" by audience members as well as heard. For the film ""Earthquake"", Sensurround was activated during the quake scenes to augment the conventional soundtrack. In addition, portions of the main soundtrack were redirected to the Sensurround horns to create a partial surround sound effect. The control tones recorded on the film's optical or magnetic track triggered the rumble or surround sound effects as well as controlling their volume and the overall blend of the main soundtrack and low frequency noise effects. Two tones of 25 Hz and 35 Hz were used: these two tones allowed different effects to be activated when desired: the rumble could be turned on or off in the Sensurround horns, the main soundtrack could be sent to the Sensurround horns, the level of both the rumble and the soundtrack coming from the horns could be varied by varying the level of the control tones and the theater's main audio system could be increased in level by up to 8 dB at select points to create a greater dynamic range (MCA called this the ""Step-Gain"" function.) For the original version of Sensurround, prints were available in the following formats: Sensurround Mod-II. Even before ""Earthquake"" ended its theatrical run, MCA began a program to re-engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, dbx Type-II noise reduction was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but didn't want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater. Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in ""Rollercoaster"".) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10 Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system 'Sensurround Mod-II' and the 'public' name of the system was changed from just 'Sensurround' to the 'Sensurround Special Effects System.'  Unlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own ""special effects"" systems to create Sensurround-type effects. Sensurround Mod-III. Mod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16–25 Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in ""Battlestar Galactica"" in 1978. Sensurround was a highly successful theatrical sound system. By 1976, when ""Midway"" opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the USA. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the USA—perhaps 30 in all—and that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, wouldn't want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: ""Earthquake"" premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. ""Midway"" opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of ""Midway"", theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive. Throughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done. History. Awards. In 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special Scientific and Engineering Academy Award for ""the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation."" The film ""Earthquake"" also won an Academy Award for Best Sound (Ronald Pierce, Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.). In 1976, MCA was granted for the Sensurround system. Drawbacks. Sensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 a month in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences. Sensurround made ""Earthquake"" a popular ""event"" film in 1974 and one of the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in multiplex cinemas where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for ""The Godfather Part II"", which opened the same month (November 1974) as ""Earthquake"", often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when ""Earthquake"" was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues. A safety net was installed at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling. When ""Earthquake"" was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as ""Midway"", also tended to play in single-screen cinemas. The success of ""Star Wars"" over ""Rollercoaster"" in the summer 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. ""Saga of a Star World"" (aka: Battlestar Galactica) marked the final bow of Sensurround one year later (1978). Competing processes. The success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. 20th Century Fox released ""Damnation Alley"" (1977) in Sound 360, and Warner Brothers employed their Megasound process for ""Altered States"" (1980), ""Outland"" (1981), ""Wolfen"" (1981) and ""Superman II"" (1981). Remastering. Releases for home video have attempted to reproduce the Sensurround effect in various ways. The DVD of ""Earthquake"" from Universal Home Video, released on May 9, 2006, claims to feature the Sensurround track (described as ""Sensurround 3.1"" but not related to ""Sensurround Mod-III""). In this case, the Sensurround 3.1 track is just the mono soundtrack fed to the 3 front speakers and the LFE channel. The 25 and 35 Hz control tones are present on the LFE track even though original audiences never heard these tones. The 3.1 sound mix is not a duplication of the Sensurround system, and neither is the 5.1 soundtrack. The 5.1 channel Dolby Digital mix is a completely new remix of the 4-track stereo original and in no way duplicates or even simulates the original Sensurround experience, nor does it convey the quality of the original 4-track mix. Earthquake was one of the first 4-track mag films to be mixed with all dialog confined to the center channel; directional dialogue was not used. For theaters that did not install the Sensurround system, the original mix utilized extensive surround effects. Mag stereo prints used the 12 kHz CinemaScope 'switching' tone included on the surround track to reduce hiss heard from the surround speakers. (The 12 kHz switching was a gating technique used as a crude method of noise reduction and was employed from the beginning of the CinemaScope format.) In theaters that utilized Sensurround and the magnetic stereo prints of ""Earthquake"", the No. 4 (surround) magnetic preamplifier was disconnected and the print's surround track was not used at all. For both mono and mag stereo prints, the Sensurround system itself provided the surround sound effects by feeding the center channel (mag track #2) to the Sensurround horns in the back of the theater. None of the surround channel effects are present in the surround loudspeakers on the 5.1 channel DVD mix of ""Earthquake""—they are all mixed to the front channels. Furthermore, the DVDs of ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Midway"" and ""Rollercoaster"" aren't authentic as the 'rumble' on their tracks is that of the control tones. Because they had no control over the sound system equipment used by home viewers, no attempt was made by Universal to properly reproduce the surround sound effect that was such an integral part of the Sensurround experience. Surviving equipment. The last two known original ""Sensurround Model-1"" control boxes are owned by Dolby Laboratories. They are loaned on occasion for revival screenings of films using the process. At least one replica system exists, as it was custom built for a 2004 London revival screening of ""Earthquake."" Sensurround Mod-II and Mod-III boxes are extremely common and relatively easy to find from old theater equipment dealers and can be bought for $50 or so. The Mod-II and Mod-III boxes were mostly just modifications of the original control boxes, but the changes are not easily undone to make them capable of running ""Earthquake"" because MCA did all the modifications themselves and never released any documentation about the changes made to each circuit card in the unit. Cultural references. The alternative pop/rock band They Might Be Giants released a song entitled ""Sensurround"" that was incorporated in the soundtrack to """" and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their EP ""S-E-X-X-Y"". The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in ""Earthquake"". An early ""FoxTrot"" comic has Jason presenting his dinosaur movie in Sensurround. The Sex Pistols song 'Holidays in the Sun' makes reference to Sensurround in the opening of the second verse (""In Sensurround sound, in a two inch wall, I was waiting for the communist call""). "
wikipedia-1261843," Milbenkäse  Milbenkäse (""mite cheese""), called Mellnkase in the local dialect and often (erroneously) known as Spinnenkäse (""spider cheese""), is a German specialty cheese made from quark and produced using the action of cheese mites. Historically, the cheese was produced in the Saxony-Anhalt/Thuringia border region of Zeitz and Altenburg districts; today it is produced exclusively in the village of Würchwitz, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The traditional method of making ""Milbenkäse"", which dates back to the Middle Ages, was nearly lost by 1970, with only the elderly Liesbeth Brauer knowing the technique. Local science teacher Helmut Pöschel was taught the proper way to make ""Milbenkäse"" and together with his associate Christian Schmelzer managed to revitalize the tradition. A memorial was later erected at Würchwitz to celebrate the renaissance of ""Milbenkäse"" production. The rear side of the memorial is hollow and is regularly stocked with small bits of ""Milbenkäse"" for passersby and tourists to try. ""Milbenkäse"" is said to taste similar to Harzer cheese, but with a bitter note (increasing with age) and a distinctive zesty aftertaste. Mites clinging to the cheese rind are consumed along with the cheese. Production. Quark flavoured with salt and caraway is shaped into small balls, cylinders or wheels, and dried. Then it is placed in a wooden box containing rye flour and inhabited by ""Tyrophagus casei"" mites for at least three months. The digestive juices of the mites diffuse into the cheese and cause fermentation; the flour is added because the mites would otherwise simply eat the whole cheese instead of just nibbling away at the crust as is desired. After one month, the cheese rind turns yellow; after three months, reddish-brown. Some producers allow the cheese to ripen for up to one year, until it has turned black. Legality. ""Milbenkäse"" falls into something of a legal grey area: EU Regulation 178/2002 allows the sale of foodstuffs containing living animals if they are ""prepared for placing on the market for human consumption"". On the other hand, cheese mites or their digestive juices are not explicitly permitted as additives for cheese according to the relevant German food ordinances (""Zusatzstoff-Zulassungsverordnung"" and ""Käseverordnung""). ""Milbenkäse"" is produced under a permit by the local food safety office and HACCP compliance of the product is enforced. Similar cheeses. Cheese mites are used in cheese maturing elsewhere. The most famous example is probably Mimolette from northeastern France and nearby Belgium. Other French cheeses - mainly from the Massif Central, the French Alps and the Pyrenees - sometimes host cheese mites in their crust more (e.g. old Cantal and Salers) or less (e.g. certain Tomme de Montagne varieties) by accident. But most of these cheeses are semi-hard to hard rennet cheeses, whereas ""Milbenkäse"" is a softer sour milk cheese.  The Spanish Cabrales cheese of the Asturias region also contains living cheese mites, though they are few in number, inhabit the mold canals, and take no significant part in the maturation of this blue cheese.  Another cheese that contains living animals is Casu marzu, which contains larvae of the cheese fly. "
wikipedia-1261856," Robert Ressler  Robert K. Ressler (February 15, 1937 – May 5, 2013) was a former FBI agent and author. He played a significant role in the psychological profiling of violent offenders in the 1970s and is often credited with coining the English term ""serial killer"". Life and career. Born in Chicago, he served in the U.S. Army before joining the FBI in 1970. Ressler was recruited into the Behavioral Science Unit that deals with drawing up psychological profiles of violent offenders who typically select victims at random, such as rapists and serial killers. In the early 1980s, Ressler helped to organize the interviews of thirty-six incarcerated serial killers in order to find parallels between such criminals' backgrounds and motives. He was also instrumental in setting up Vi-CAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program). This consists of a centralized computer database of information on unsolved homicides. Information is gathered from local police forces and cross-referenced with other unsolved killings across the United States. Working on the basis that most serial killers claim similar victims with a standard method (""modus operandi"") it hopes to spot early on when a killer is carrying out crimes in different jurisdictions. This was primarily a response to the appearance of nomadic killers who committed crimes in different areas. So long as the killer kept on the move, the police forces in each state would be unaware that there were multiple victims and would just be investigating a single homicide each, unaware that other police forces had similar crimes. Vi-CAP would help individual police forces determine if they were hunting for the same perpetrator so that they could share and correlate information with one another, increasing their chances of identifying a suspect. He worked on many cases of serial homicide such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Chase and John Joubert. Ressler retired from the FBI in 1990 and authored of a number of books about serial murder. He actively gave lectures to students and police forces on the subject of criminology, and in 1993 was brought in to London to assist in the investigation into the murders committed by Colin Ireland. Ressler's visit to Ciudad Juárez (in Mexico) to investigate the still-active femicides occurring there served as inspiration for the character Albert Kessler in Roberto Bolaño's novel """". "
wikipedia-1261868," Tom yum  Tom yum or tom yam (Lao: ຕົ້ມຍຳ ; , ) is a spicy clear soup typical in Laos and Thailand. Tom yum is widely served in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, and has been popularised around the world. Literally, the words ""tom yum"" are derived from two Tai words: ""tom"" and ""yam"". ""Tom"" refers to boiling process, while ""yam"" refers to a kind of Lao and Thai spicy and sour salad. Thus, ""tom yum"" is a Lao and Thai hot and sour soup. Indeed, tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, with fragrant herbs generously used in the broth. The basic broth is made of stock and fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers. In neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, the name ""tom yum"" is used widely for various spicy soups which can differ greatly from true Lao and Thai tom yum soup. As a result, people are often confused by the disparities. Commercial tom yum paste is made by crushing all the herb ingredients and stir frying in oil. Seasoning and other preservative ingredients are then added. The paste is bottled or packaged and sold around the world. Tom yum flavoured with the paste may have different characteristics from that made with fresh herb ingredients. The soup often includes meats such as chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. The 1997 Financial Crisis in Asia, which started in Thailand, is sometimes referred to as the ""Tom Yam Kung Crisis"". Selected types. In the modern popularized versions the soup contains also mushrooms - usually straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms. The soup is often topped with generous sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Sometimes Thai chili jam (""nam phrik phao"", ) is added: this gives the soup a bright orange color and makes the chili flavour more pronounced. The Royal Lao version of tom yam includes a pinch of rice in the soup. Other sour and spicy soups. Less well-known outside Thailand is ""tom khlong"" (ต้มโคล้ง), a spicy sour soup where the sourness, however, does not derive from lime juice but through the use of tamarind. ""Tom som"" () are soups that are also very similar to ""tom yum"" but most often do not contain lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves. Depending on the type of ""tom som"", the acidity can be derived from lime juice or from the use of tamarind. "

It can be translated as “she who delights the heart” or “she who is pleasing”. Dilara is also an Uyghur (old Turkish) name. In Uyghur language ""Dil"" means heart and ""Ara"" means between. Hence, the name to Uyghurs would mean ""in the heart"".  "
wikipedia-386095," Necrons  In the table-top wargame ""Warhammer 40,000"", the Necrons are a mysterious skeletal robot-like race that have lain dormant and largely unknown by the other races of the universe for sixty four million years, and are reemerging in the distant future of the ""Warhammer 40,000"" universe. Within the game's universe, the Necrons have become known and feared for their ability to absorb physical damage and repair themselves, as well as their enigmatic, yet powerful, Gauss weapons and arcane technology. Most ""Warhammer 40,000"" armies are inspired by fantasy and popular culture to an extent, however the Necrons are noted for combining ideas from dissimilar sources. The overall feel is an army that is supposed to be soulless, relentless and unstoppable. The Necron Warriors bear resemblance to the Terminators of the Terminator series. The Necrons fill the role of the undead in the ""Warhammer 40,000"" universe, and are roughly analogous to the Tomb Kings from ""Warhammer Fantasy Battle"". Development history. The Necrons first appeared as usable units for Warhammer 40,000 as Necron Raiders. The rules for these were first published in ""White Dwarf"" Issue 216 towards the end of the lifespan of the second edition of ""Warhammer 40,000"". At the time, only ""Necron Warriors"" and ""Scarabs"" were given game rules and the warriors were armed with ""Gauss-Flayer Guns"". This was quickly followed up with an expanded army list in the following month's issue of the same magazine. The ""Necron Lord"" and ""Necron Destroyer"" were part of this slightly-expanded army list. At the time, the lord was armed with the ""Staff of Light"" while the destroyers were armed with ""Gauss-Cannons"". The issue of ""White Dwarf"" also had the Necrons' first major appearance in a battle report in the article entitled ""Massacre at Sanctuary 101"", a battle between the Necrons and the Sisters of Battle. This particular altercation soon made its way into the background material as one of the first times the Imperium officially encountered the Necrons. The first Necron miniatures, all metal, were also released during this time. In fact, a free Necron Warrior was included with issue 217 of ""White Dwarf"". In the release of the third edition of Warhammer 40,000 in 1998, the Necrons had no usable army list. The first, full-fledged Necron army list for the new edition of the game was printed in the March 1999 issue of ""White Dwarf"". This first army list was very restrictive, with the Necrons having mostly one choice per force organization category. The ""Necron Lord"", ""Necron Immortals"" and ""Necron Warriors"" were the only available HQ, Elites and Troops choices respectively. This early army list had two units for the Fast Attack selections, ""Necron Destroyers"" and ""Scarabs"". The latter were different from their current counterparts in that the original Scarabs were controlled individually and were not swarms on a single base as they are today. The ""Necron Immortal"" metal miniature was released at the same time as the publication of the army list. In a later issue of ""White Dwarf"", Games Workshop further expanded the Necron army list by providing different equipment choices (wargear) for the ""Necron Lord"". Along with the ""Gaze of Flame"" and ""Scourge of Light"" upgrades, this was the first time that the ""Veil of Darkness"" wargear was added to the Necron Lord's available options. The Necrons received their first, full sourcebook with the release of ""Codex: Necrons"" in August 2002. The book featured a wealth of background information expanding upon the origins of the Necron race and expanded the scope of the Warhammer 40,000 history by several million years more. A full army list was also introduced in the sourcebook, with heavily revamped rules for existing units and the introduction of new ones. New units introduced in the codex were ""Flayed Ones"", ""Pariahs"", ""Wraiths"", ""Heavy Destroyers"", the ""Necron Monolith"" and the infamous ""C'tan"". New miniatures were produced and released alongside with the release of the codex. Necrons received their first plastic miniatures kit in the form of the Necron Warriors boxed set, which contained enough parts to make twelve Necron Warriors and three Scarab bases with four Scarabs each. The boxed set was a first for Games Workshop, as it was the first time that transparent, coloured parts were included in a boxed set along with the standard polystyrene parts. The transparent, green rods in this case were meant to be used as part of the Necrons' gauss weaponry. The Necron Destroyer model was also revamped and made into a plastic kit. Whereas the old, metal version was essentially a Necron Warrior riding a flying platform, the new Necron Destroyer plastic kit featured a Necron Immortal torso mounted and merged with a floating platform. The other miniatures released for the army were metal, such as the Flayed Ones, Immortals, Pariahs, Wraiths and the Necron Lord. Two more miniatures soon followed suit - the massive Necron Monolith, the largest miniature kit produced by Games Workshop at the time, and the Necron Destroyer Lord, a Necron Lord mounted on a Destroyer body. New miniatures and a new codex were released on November 7, 2011. Among the changes the new codex will introduce is a complete reboot of the Necrons' backstory. In the beginning the Necrontyr (as their former living forms were called) started out as scientifically advanced alien race, who were obsessed with extending their very short life spans. Upon meeting the ""Old Ones"" - an ancient race who enjoyed near immortality - the Necrontyr's jealousy caused them to go to war with them. The Necrontyr were on the verge of defeat when the C'Tan appeared and offered them immortality (opposed to the original story where the Necrontyr coaxed the C'Tan into aiding them). Their ruler, the Silent King, took the offer and later realized that his people had lost their souls in the process - becoming the ever-living Necrons, and after the War in Heaven, the Silent King got revenge on the C'Tan by shattering their forms into hundreds of pieces, shattering and weakening their power. After taking over the galaxy the Silent King ordered the Necrons to sleep, and then set off directionless on his ship in hopes of finding someway to gain atonement for his failure to his people. Finally awakening, the Necrons seek to restore their dynasty to its ancient former glory. Tactics. Before their new codex Necrons were an extremely unique army, having the durability of Space Marines, and focusing largely on firepower, but lacked vehicles and only had two melee units, usually sticking to attrition style warfare, relying on their durability to keep them alive while dwindling down the enemy. The Necrons most distinct traits are their ability to return killed models to life, and that every one of their weapons has the potential to damage vehicles. Their new codex included many new units, including vehicles, transports, and melee units, giving them far more diversity, though their true strength still lies in their durability and shooting. "
wikipedia-386097," Type 42 destroyer  The Type 42 or ""Sheffield"" class, are light guided missile destroyers used by the Royal Navy and the Argentine Navy. The first ship of the class was ordered in 1968 and launched in 1971. Two of the class (""Sheffield"" and ""Coventry"") were sunk in action during the Falklands Conflict of 1982. The UK Royal Navy used this class of destroyer for 38 years between 1975 and 2013. No ships of this class remain active in the Royal Navy and just one remains in the Argentine Navy. The Royal Navy has replaced them with Type 45 destroyers. History. The class was designed in the late 1960s to provide fleet area air-defence. In total fourteen vessels were constructed in three batches. In addition to the Royal Navy ships, two more ships were built to the same specifications as the Batch 1 vessels for the Argentine Navy. When the Type 82 air-defence destroyers were cancelled along with the proposed CVA-01 carrier by the Labour Government of 1966, the Type 42 was proposed as a lighter and cheaper design with similar capabilities to the Type 82. The class is fitted with the GWS30 Sea Dart surface-to-air missile first deployed on the sole Type 82, . The Type 42s were also given a flight deck and hangar to operate an anti-submarine warfare helicopter, greatly increasing their utility compared to the Type 82, which was fitted with a flight deck but no organic aviation facilities. The design was budgeted with a ceiling of £19 million per hull, but soon ran over-budget. The original proposed design (£21 million) was similar to the lengthened 'Batch 3' Type 42s. To cut costs, the first two batches had 47 feet removed from the bow sections forward of the bridge, and the beam-to-length ratio was proportionally reduced. These early, batch 1 Type 42s performed poorly during the contractor's sea trials particularly in heavy seas, and the hull was extensively examined for other problems. Batch 2 vessels (""Exeter"" onwards) embodied better sensors fits, and slight layout modifications. The ninth hull, ""Manchester"", was lengthened in build, as part of an extensive design review. This proved a better hull form at sea and later hulls were built to this specification, although minor equipment and hull layout changes made the remaining ships all unique in their own way. Strengthening girders were later designed into the weather deck structure in the batch 1 and 2 ships, and the batch 3 ships received an external 'strake' to counter longitudinal cracking. ""Mickey Mouse"" ears. The first of class, ""Sheffield"", was initially fitted with the odd-looking ""Mickey Mouse"" ears on her funnel tops which were in fact exhaust deflectors - ""Loxton bends"" - for the Rolls Royce Olympus TM1A turbine engines, to guide the high-temperature exhaust efflux sidewards and minimise damage to overhead aerials. As this provided a prominent target for the new infra-red homing missiles, these deflectors were removed during ""Sheffield""s 1979–1980 refit in Portsmouth. All subsequent Olympus and Tyne uptakes were fitted with 'cheese graters' which mixed machinery space vent air with the engine exhaust to reduce infra-red signatures. Remaining Type 42s. The surviving Argentine Type 42, ARA ""Hercules"", is based at Puerto Belgrano, Argentina and has been converted into an amphibious command ship through the addition of a new aft superstructure and hangar. It is also fitted with Exocet missile launchers. The other Argentine vessel, ARA ""Santísima Trinidad"", capsized and sank alongside her berth at Puerto Belgrano on 22 January 2013, reportedly as a result of poor maintenance and negligence leading to a burst seawater main and catastrophic flooding. Prior to her demise, ""Santissima Trinidad"" was extensively cannibalised for spare parts for her more active sister ship. Design details. The Type 42 destroyer was built to fill the gap left by the cancellation of the large Type 82 destroyer. It was intended to fulfil the same role, with similar systems on a smaller and more cost effective hull. The ships are primarily carriers for the GWS-30 Sea Dart surface-to-air missile system. Although often described as obsolete, it still proved effective against modern missile threats during the 1991 Gulf War. The Type 42 is also equipped with a 4.5-inch Mark 8 naval gun and earlier vessels shipped six Ships Torpedo Weapon System (STWS) torpedo launchers. Two Vulcan Phalanx Mk 15 Close-In Weapons Systems (CIWS) were fitted to British Type 42s in way of the carried 27-foot whaler and Cheverton launch after the loss of ""Sheffield"" to an Exocet missile. There have been three batches of ships, batch 1 & 2 displacing 4,820 tonnes and batch 3 (sometimes referred to as the ""Manchester"" class) displacing 5,200 tonnes. The batch 3 ships were heavily upgraded, though the proposed Sea Wolf missile systems upgrades were never fitted. Because of their more general warfare role, both Argentine ships were been fitted with the MM38 Exocet, and not with a CIWS. The electronics suite includes one Type 1022 D-band long range radar with Outfit LFB track extractor or one Type 965P long range air surveillance radar, one Type 996 E/F-band 3D target indication radar with Outfit LFA track extractor or type 992Q surface search, two Type 909 I/J-band fire control radars and an Outfit LFD Radar Track Combiner. All ships were propelled by Rolls Royce TM3B Olympus and Rolls Royce RM1C Tyne marinised gas turbines, arranged in a COGOG (Combined Gas or Gas) arrangement, driving through synchronous self-shifting clutches into a double reduction, dual tandem, articulated, locked-train gear system and out through two five-bladed controllable pitch propellers. All have four Paxman Ventura 16YJCAZ diesel generators, each generating 1 Megawatt of three-phase 440V 60 Hz power. Availability and use of the Type 42. This class was originally conceived to be a stopper for long-range strategic bombers from the former Soviet air force and as area defence for carrier task groups. As world political climates shifted, so too the role of the Type 42 followed. The class reached its operational zenith during the Falklands Conflict with seven ships partaking in Operation Corporate and the immediate aftermath. The Type 42 provided a capable, if limited, long range reach against Argentine air force assets, confirming three kills. With their weaknesses exposed - ""Sheffield"" hit, disabled and sunk by a long-range, first generation air-to surface missile, ""Coventry"" sunk by conventional (British designed) iron bombs and ""Glasgow"" disabled by a single bomb which passed straight through her aft engine room without exploding - an extensive rethink was conducted and future iterations in and out of build and refit contained better upgrades, but limited by the Type 42s now ageing overall design. Later uses involved Gulf War 1, where ""Gloucester"" struck and eliminated a large, land-based surface to surface missile with her Seadart missile system. Moreover than not, Type 42s were called upon to carry out Fleet Contingency Ship (FCS) duties, Atlantic Patrol (North) (West Indies counter drugs ops) and Atlantic Patrol (South) (Falkland Islands patrol), Standing Naval Force Mediterranean and Atlantic and Armilla patrols. There was essentially no task this ship class was not engaged in over its forty year collective career. As far as value-for-money is concerned, notwithstanding its ability to burn fifteen tonnes per hour of marine diesel at top speed and a large, cramped ships' company, this ship provided the UK with considerable ability during a very changeable political, economic and military background of change. The deployment of Type 23s in lieu of Type 42s to high-intensity mission areas became more prevalent as serviceability and reliability issues dogged Type 42s availability as has obsolescence of their combat and machinery system equipment. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) sounded a death knell for these venerable warships and they have all been decommissioned and in most cases scrapped. Construction programme. In May 1982, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Jerry Wiggin) stated that the current replacement cost of a Type 42 destroyer of the ""Sheffield"" class was ""about £120 million."" In July 1984, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (John Lee) stated: ""the average cost of the three Type 42 destroyers currently under construction is £117 million at 1983–84 price levels."" Running costs. Including refits and upgrades. In May 2000, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (John Spellar) stated: ""The running costs of each of the Royal Navy's Type 42 destroyers for each of the past five years are contained in the following table. This includes repair and maintenance, manpower, fuel and other costs such as port and harbour dues. Year-on-year variations are largely attributable to refit periods."" Availability. In February 1998, the Minister of State for Defence, Dr Reid said: ""Type 42 destroyers achieved approximately 84 to 86 per cent average availability for operational service in each of the last five years. This discounts time spent in planned maintenance."" Replacement. The UK ships are all now decommissioned. By 2007 none of the batch 1 vessels remained in commission. Initially the UK sought to procure replacements first in collaboration with seven other NATO nations under the NFR-90 project and then with France and Italy through the Horizon CNGF programme. However, both these collaborative ventures failed and the UK decided to go it alone with a national project. The UK Type 42s are succeeded by six Type 45 destroyers. , , , and are in commission and the other Type 45 is currently Accepted off Contract and due to be in service by November 2013. The Type 42 class has always suffered from cramped accommodation, a problem for crew safety and comfort, and also when finding space for upgrades. The Type 45s are considerably larger, displacing 7,500 tonnes, compared to the Type 42 displacement of 3,600 tonnes. "
wikipedia-386100," Microscope slide  A microscope slide is a thin flat piece of glass, typically 75 by 25 mm (3 by 1 inches) and about 1 mm thick, used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. Typically the object is placed or secured (""mounted"") on the slide, and then both are inserted together in the microscope for viewing. This arrangement allows several slide-mounted objects to be quickly inserted and removed from the microscope, labeled, transported, and stored in appropriate slide cases or folders. Microscope slides are often used together with a cover slip or cover glass, a smaller and thinner sheet of glass that is placed over the specimen. Slides are held in place on the microscope's stage by slide clips, slide clamps or a cross-table which is used to achieve precise, remote movement of the slide upon the microscope's stage (such as in an automated / computer operated system, or where touching the slide with fingers is inappropriate either due to the risk of contamination or lack of precision) History. The origin of the concept was pieces of ivory or bone, containing specimens held between disks of transparent mica, that would ""slide"" into the gap between the stage and the objective. These ""sliders"" were popular in Victorian England until the Royal Microscopical Society introduced the standardized glass microscope slide. Dimensions and types. A standard microscope slide measures about 75 mm by 25 mm (3"" by 1"") and is about 1 mm thick. A range of other sizes are available for various special purposes, such as 75 x 50 mm and for geological use, 46 x 27 mm for petrographic studies, and 48 x 28 mm for thin sections. Slides are usually made of common glass and their edges are often finely ground or polished. Microscope slides are usually made of optical quality glass, such as soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, but specialty plastics are also used. Fused quartz slides are often used when ultraviolet transparency is important, e.g. in fluorescence microscopy. While plain slides are the most common, there are several specialized types. A concavity slide or cavity slide has one or more shallow depressions (""wells""), designed to hold slightly thicker objects, and certain samples such as liquids and tissue cultures. Slides may have rounded corners for increased safety or robustness, or a cut-off corner for use with a slide clamp or cross-table, where the slide is secured by a spring-loaded curved arm contacting one corner, forcing the opposing corner of the slide against a right angled arm which does not move. If this system were used with a slide which did not incorporate these cut-off corners, the corners would chip and the slide could shatter.  A graticule slide is marked with a grid of lines (for example, a 1 mm grid) that allows the size of objects seen under magnification to be easily estimated and provides reference areas for counting minute objects. Sometimes one square of the grid will itself be subdivided into a finer grid. Slides for specialized applications, such as cell counting, may have various reservoirs, channels and barriers etched or ground on their upper surface. Various permanent markings or masks may be printed, sand-blasted, or deposited on the surface by the manufacturer, usually with inert materials such as PTFE. Some slides have a frosted or enamel-coated area at one end, for labeling with a pencil or pen. Slides may have special coatings applied by the manufacturer, e.g. for chemical inertness or enhanced cell adhesion. The coating may have a permanent electric charge to hold thin or powdery samples. Common coatings include poly-L-lysine, silanes, epoxy resins, or even gold. Mounting. The mounting of specimens on microscope slides is often critical for successful viewing. The problem has been given much attention in the last two centuries and is a well-developed area with many specialized and sometimes quite sophisticated techniques. Dry mount. In a dry mount, the simplest kind of mounting, the object is merely placed on the slide. A cover slip may be placed on top to protect the specimen and the microscope's objective and to keep the specimen still and pressed flat. This mounting can be successfully used for viewing specimens like pollen, feathers, hairs, etc. It is also used to examine particles caught in transparent membrane filters (e.g., in analysis of airborne dust). Wet mount or temporary mount. In a wet mount, the specimen is placed in a drop of water or other liquid held between the slide and the cover slip by surface tension. This method is commonly used, for example, to view microscopic organisms that grow in pond water or other liquid media, especially when studying their movement and behavior. Care must be taken to exclude air bubbles that would interfere with the viewing and hamper the organisms' movements. It is also used for rapid investigations where a permanent record is not required, as well as to examine physiological liquids like blood, urine, saliva, semen (in semen analysis), and vaginal discharge (in vaginal wet mount). Prepared mount or permanent mount. For pathological and biological research, the specimen usually undergoes a complex histological preparation that may involve cutting it into very thin sections with a microtome, fixing it to prevent decay, removing any water contained in it, staining specific parts of it, clearing to render it transparent, and impregnating or infiltrating it with some transparent solid substance. As part of this process the specimen usually ends up firmly attached to the slide. Strew mount. Strew mounting describes the production of palynological microscope slides by suspending a concentrated sample in distilled water, placing the samples on a slide, and allowing the water to evaporate. Mounting media. The mounting medium is the solution in which the specimen is embedded, generally under a cover glass. Simple liquids like water or glycerol can be considered mounting media, though the term generally refers to compounds that harden into a permanent mount. Popular mounting media include Permount, glycerol jelly, and Hoyer's mounting medium. Properties of a good mounting medium include having a refractive index close to that of glass (1.518), non-reactivity with the specimen, stability over time without crystallizing, darkening, or changing refractive index, solubility in the medium the specimen was prepared in (either aqueous or non-polar, such as xylene or toluene), and not causing the specimen stain to fade or leach. Examples of mounting media. Aqueous. Popularly used in immunofluorescent cytochemistry where the fluorescence cannot be archieved. The temporary storage must be done in a dark moist chamber. Common examples are: Non-Aqueous. Used when a permanent mount is required Contrasting with other types/meanings of ""mounting"". In contrast to mounting necessary for glass coverslips, somewhat similar mounting can be done for bulkier specimen preservation in glass containers in museums. However an entirely different type of mounting is done for Electron_microscope#Sample_preparation which can be for biological or nonbiological materials and is further subdivided into ""hot""(compressive) and ""cold"" (castable) type mounting processes. Though named ""mounting"", it is more akin to embedding in histology and should not be confused with the mounting described above. The term mounting in other fields has numerous other meanings which are partially indexed in this disambiguation page on Mounting. "
wikipedia-386111," General Motors streetcar conspiracy  The General Motors streetcar conspiracy (also known as the Great American streetcar scandal) refers to allegations and convictions in relation to a program by General Motors (GM) and other companies who purchased and then dismantled streetcar and electric train systems in many American cities. Between 1936 and 1950, National City Lines and Pacific City Lines—with investment from GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks, and the Federal Engineering Corporation—bought over 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities including Baltimore, Newark, Los Angeles, New York City, Oakland and San Diego and converted them into bus operation. Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. Some suggest that this program played a key role in the decline of public transit in cities across the United States; notably Edwin J. Quinby, who first drew attention to the program in 1946, and then Bradford C. Snell, an anti-trust attorney for the United States Senate whose controversial 1974 testimony to a Senate inquiry brought the issue to national awareness. Both Quinby and Snell argued that the deliberate destruction of streetcars was part of a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. Others say that independent economic factors brought about changes in the transit system, including the Great Depression, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, labor unrest, market forces, rapidly increasing traffic congestion, urban sprawl, taxation policies that favored private vehicle ownership, and general enthusiasm for the automobile. One writer on the subject has suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic conspiracy theory thinking, bordering on paranoid delusions saying ""Clearly, GM waged a war on electric traction. It was indeed an all out assault, but by no means the single reason for the failure of rapid transit. Also, it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government contributed significantly to the elimination of electric traction.""  Only a small handful of U.S. cities have surviving effective rail-based urban transport systems based on streetcars or trams, including Newark, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Boston; others are re-introducing them. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, notably in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Taken for a Ride"" and ""The End of Suburbia"". History. Background. In the 19th century, city transit systems were rail-based, first using horsecars and later cable cars or trams powered by electricity. Electrically powered trolleybuses were also common. At one time, nearly every city in the U.S. with a population over 10,000 had at least one streetcar company: nearly all were privately owned and were later dismantled. Author and former U.S. Senate antitrust attorney Bradford Snell estimates that in 1920, 90% of all trips were via rail using 1,200 separate electric street and interurban railways with of track, 300,000 employees, 15 billion annual passengers, and $1 billion in income. Only one in 10 Americans owned an automobile Early years. In 1922, GM President and CEO Alfred P. Sloan established a special unit within the corporation charged with the task of replacing America's electric railways with cars, trucks and buses. The Omnibus Corporation was formed in 1926 by John D. Hertz with ""plans embracing the extension of motor coach operation to urban and rural communities in every part of the United States"" and that said that ""it was not the purpose of the corporation to enter into competition with street car companies or railroads, but to work with them for the rehabilitation of street car companies or parts of railroads in sections where the service was now inadequate."" Omnibus owned the Chicago Motor Coach Company, which Hertz had founded to operate buses in Chicago, and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company in New York. That same year, the Fifth Avenue Coach Company acquired a majority of the stock in the struggling New York Railways Corporation. Hertz was made a GM board member by 1927 when the company acquired a controlling share of the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company, a successful bus and coach manufacturer founded by Hertz in 1923. In 1932, GM formed a new subsidiary—United Cities Motor Transport (UCMT)—to finance the conversion of streetcar systems to buses in small cities. UCMT purchased several smaller systems within Michigan and Ohio before being censured by the American Transit Association after approaching the city of Portland, Oregon with a similar proposal. UCMT was dissolved in 1935. Conversion. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 caused great difficulties for the streetcar operators by making it illegal for a single business to both provide public transport and supply electricity to other parties. E. Quinby later asked ""Who is behind this campaign to separate the obviously economical combination of electric railway and its power plant?"". When the New York Railways Corporation converted streetcars to buses in 1935 and 1936, the new bus services were operated by the New York City Omnibus Corporation, which shared management with The Omnibus Corporation. National City Lines, Pacific City Lines, American City Lines. 1936 saw GM establish several front companies for the express purpose of purchasing and dismantling America's streetcar systems.  National City Lines (NCL), a bus operation founded in 1920 by an E. Roy Fitzgerald and his brother, was reorganized into a holding company. By 1938, Pacific City Lines (PCL) was formed to purchase streetcar systems in the western United States. NCL raised funds to purchase transportation systems in cities ""where streetcars were no longer practicable"" and to replace them with buses. Investors consisted of Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation), Phillips Petroleum (now part of ConocoPhillips), GM, Mack Trucks (now a subsidiary of Volvo), and the Federal Engineering Corporation. In 1941, PCL attempted a hostile takeover of the Key System, which operated electric trains and streetcars in Oakland, California (details about this were not made public until 1955). American City Lines (ACL) was organized to acquire local transportation systems in the larger metropolitan areas in various parts of the country in 1943 and merged with NCL in 1946. As the 1940s progressed, the three companies gained more power. NCL acquired the Los Angeles Railway (aka the ""Yellow Cars"") in 1945 and converted many lines to bus routes. By 1946, the company had acquired 64% of the stock in the Key System which operated electric trains and streetcars in Oakland, California. Many of these conversions to buses resulted in public outcries. Edwin J. Quinby. That same year, Edwin J. Quinby, a recently retired naval lieutenant commander, published a 24-page expose on the owners of NCL. It was addressed to ""The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community"" and began, ""This is an urgent warning to each and every one of you that there is a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System"". Quinby had previously worked for the North Jersey Rapid Transit, which operated in New York and had established up the Electric Rail Users Association in 1934, which lobbied on behalf of rail users and services. He was later to write a history of North Jersey Rapid Transit. By 1947, NCL owned or controlled 46 systems in 45 cities in 16 states. Court cases. On April 9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals (constituting officers and directors of certain of the corporate defendants) were indicted in the Federal District Court of Southern California on counts of ""conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopoly"" and ""conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines"" which had been made illegal by the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act. In 1948, the venue was changed from the Federal District Court of Southern California to the Federal District Court in Northern Illinois following an appeal to the United States Supreme Court (in ""United States v. National City Lines Inc."") which felt that there was evidence of conspiracy to monopolize the supply of buses and supplies. The San Diego Electric Railway was sold to Western Transit Company, which was owned by a J. L. Haugh, Oakland, for $5.5 million in 1948. Jessie Haugh was also president of Key Systems which later purchased Pacific Electric Railway. The financial arrangements were not public at the time. In the same year the Baltimore Streetcar system was purchased by NCL and started converting the system to buses. Conviction, $1 fine. In 1949, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, GM and Mack Trucks were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to local transit companies controlled by NCL and other companies; they were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. The verdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951. Bradford Snell summed up the controversial verdict, as the punishment so poorly matched the crime: ""The court imposed a sanction of $5,000 on GM. In addition, the jury convicted H.C. Grossman, who was then treasurer of GM. Grossman had played a key role in the motorization campaigns and had served as a director of Pacific City Lines when that company undertook the dismantlement of the $100 million Pacific Electric system. The court fined Grossman the magnanimous sum of $1."" According to Snell, GM's own testimony had shown that by the mid-1950s, ""its agents had canvassed more than 1,000 electric railways and that, of these, they had motorized 90%—more than 900 systems."" The struggling Pacific Electric Railway was purchased by Metropolitan Coach Lines in 1953. Jesse Haugh, who operated Metropolitan Coach Lines and was a former executive of PCL, had previously purchased San Diego Electric Railway though a separate company in 1948. The remaining streetcars were converted to buses by 1950. The remains of the Pacific Electric Railway and of the Los Angeles Railway were taken into public ownership in 1958; all routes were converted to bus routes. Though federal anti-trust action was taken against NCL, the damage was already done: Los Angeles was dominated by automobiles. Haugh sold the bus-based San Diego system to the city in 1966. 1960s to present. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 created the Federal Transit Administration with a remit to ""conserve and enhance values in existing urban areas"" noting that ""our national welfare therefore requires the provision of good urban transportation, with the properly balanced use of private vehicles and modern mass transport to help shape as well as serve urban growth."" Funding for transit was increased with the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1970 and further extended by the 1974 National Mass Transportation Assistance Act which allowed funds to support transit operating costs as well as construction costs. In 1970, Harvard Law student Robert Eldridge Hicks began working on the Ralph Nader Study Group Report on Land Use in California to report the wider conspiracy to dismantle U.S. streetcar systems. These allegations were first published in ""Politics of Land: Ralph Nader's Study Group Report on Land Use in California"". In 1974, Bradford Snell, the Senate antitrust attorney, former scholar with the Brookings Institution and attorney with Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro testified before a United States Senate inquiry into the causes of the decline of the transit car systems in the U.S., highlighting the NCL acquisitions as the primary cause. San Francisco mayor and antitrust attorney Joseph Alioto testified that ""General Motors and the automobile industry generally exhibit a kind of ""monopoly evil"""", adding that GM ""has carried on a deliberate concerted action with the oil companies and tire companies...for the purpose of destroying a vital form of competition; namely, electric rapid transit."" Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley also testified, saying that GM—through its subsidiaries (namely PCL) ""scrapped the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles streetcar systems leaving the electric train system totally destroyed"". GM published a rebuttal the same year titled ""The Truth About American Ground Transport"". The role of GM and buses in the decline of mass transit was further explored in the doctoral thesis of David Lipson in 1987. In 1997, Cliff Slater had an article published in ""Transportation Quarterly"" which challenged significant elements of Snell's 1974 evidence.  In the 1988 film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", the scandal is masked and set in Los Angeles. Scriptwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman explained: ""the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen. In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be."" In recent decades, many American cities have started reconstructing new streetcar systems, light rail, and other public transport systems. By way of example, Los Angeles has recently opened a number of streetcar lines: Blue Line (1990), Orange Line (2005) and Expo Line (2012), all of have high usage and run along routes previously used by Pacific Electric Railway (Red Car) services. One legacy of streetcars are the routes of the former streetcar lines. As the routes often occupied the main streets of many smaller communities, combined with the streets being wide enough to accommodate both directions of vehicular traffic as well as 1-2 streetcars, the downtown of many smaller cities now have main streets that are unusually wide. For instance, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, the main street going through downtown (Pennsylvania Route 18) now has two lanes in each direction, plus room for angle parking on the northbound side of the street and parallel parking on the southbound side of the street. The street's width is a remnant of the former streetcar lines that went in the middle of the road. Other factors. A number of analyses have suggested that the eventual replacement of electric-powered street cars with buses was inevitable and indeed occurred within the same timeframe in several other cities where NCL was not involved. It has been suggested that the ultimate reach of GM's conspiracy extended to approximately 10% of all transit systems, but the areas affected by GM's interference include 7 of the currently largest 9 metropolitan areas in the country. Other factors included: Myths and mysteries. The facts around what actually happened have only come out slowly. Businesses were registered in different states; some, such as National City Lines, were incorporated in Delaware, which does not require disclosure of any public information about directors or shareholders. Relevant actors. The businesses and people in this section have all been referenced by one other external sources in relation to the 'streetcar scandal'. In addition to the six business indicted in 1947: "
wikipedia-386112," Charles Ingram  Charles Ingram (born 6 August 1963) is a former British Army major who made headlines worldwide after cheating in the game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" in 2001. He was convicted of deception, although he maintains that he did not cheat. He is married to Diana Ingram (born 1965) and has since participated in other television shows, including ""The Weakest Link"" (where he appeared with his wife Diana), ""Wife Swap"" (in which he swapped lives with Jade Goody's partner) and ""Hell's Kitchen"" and controversially on Big Brother's Big Mouth. In 2003, he received a conditional discharge for insurance fraud after being found guilty of one count of deception and a related count regarding a claim against a house contents insurance policy. Education and career. Charles Ingram went to Oswestry School and obtained a BSc in Civil Engineering from Kingston Polytechnic, an MSc in Corporate Management from the Defence College of Management and Technology part of Cranfield University, Chartered membership of the Institute of Personnel and Development, membership of the Chartered Management Institute, membership of the Association for Project Management, and membership of the Society of Authors. In 1986, he trained for the Army at Sandhurst and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of Major in 1995, and in 1999, he served in Bosnia for six months on NATO peacekeeping duties. He was forced to resign from the Army in 2003, along with his rank of Major. ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" scandal. The ITV programme was produced by Celador at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The show, hosted by Chris Tarrant, was recorded on 9 September 2001 and 10 September 2001. After winning £1,000,000, the payout was suspended when Ingram was accused of cheating by having his wife, Diana, and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, cough as Ingram announced the correct answer from the available choices. Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), which ended soon after a jury member was evicted for discussing the case in public, Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of ""procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception"" on 7 April 2003. Diana Ingram had previously been a contestant and won £32,000. Her brother Adrian Pollock had also previously won the same amount. Both Diana Ingram and her brother had missed their £64,000 questions (the latter had used his 50:50 lifeline on his question). On 7 April 2003, the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months, also suspended), each fined £15,000, and each ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Ingram £40,000 and Diana Ingram £25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay £115,000. This particular episode was not only aired in the UK but also in many other countries, including the United States (where John Carpenter and Kevin Olmstead were big winners) and Australia (whose second jackpot winner was also subject to allegations of cheating but was later exonerated). On 19 August 2003, the Army Board ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major, with his state-earned pension of 17 years. On 19 May 2004, the Court of Appeal denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs. On 5 October 2004, the House of Lords denied Ingram his leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On 20 October 2004, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana Ingram's defence costs order to £5,000. On 21 May 2005, Ingram appealed against his conviction to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The CCRC completed its review in autumn 2006, concluding that ""there was insufficient prospect of overturning the conviction"". An essay written by James Plaskett in favour of the innocence of Ingram, his wife and Whittock led to the journalist Bob Woffinden, who had a longtime interest in miscarriages of justice, publishing a two-page article in the 9 October 2004 edition of the ""Daily Mail"", entitled ""Is The Coughing Major Innocent?"" Plaskett's essay also prompted a reconsideration of the case in ""The Guardian"" Comment Is Free blog on 17 July 2006 from an initially skeptical Jon Ronson. Plaskett may also be heard at Episode 29 of The Pod Delusion podcast being interviewed by political blogger, Mark Thompson, who was himself led by Plaskett's essay to take an interest in the case of The Millionaire Three. Recorded Evidence. In court, Ingram claimed the video tape was ""unrepresentative of what I heard""; indeed, he continues to assert that it was ""unfairly manipulated"". The audio recording of Whittock's coughing was amplified for the knowledge of the jury (and viewers in later television accounts) during the trial. He claims that he neither listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing. The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs clearly heard on the video tape recorded louder than both Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, were ""significant"". Chris Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing, claiming he was too busy to notice. Testimony of Larry Whitehurst. Whitehurst, another contestant who has appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced coughing had helped Ingram. Testimony of Tecwen Whittock. Whittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life and insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answer. During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself was picked to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared. Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras. Tecwen Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to question number 12 regarding the artist who painted ""The Ambassadors"" in a hand-written general knowledge book at his home. Davies, the floor manager, said that, as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording, he decided to find out who was responsible. ""The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three"", he claimed. ""He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough."" Whittock remarked during the trial that ""you do not cough into someone's face"". During the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a ""serial quiz show loser"" because he had been eliminated in round one of ""15 to 1"" and had only won an atlas on his appearance on ""Sale of the Century"". However, Whittock twice won the Wales heat of ""Brain of Britain"" (on BBC Radio 4), and in the 1994 semi-final, was only narrowly beaten into runner-up spot. In the 1997 semi-final, he could only manage third place and the heat was easily won by quiz legend Daphne Fowler. After the show. Tarrant, who drank champagne with the Ingrams in their dressing room, said he was convinced that Ingram was genuine when he signed the £1 million cheque, saying that ""If I thought there was anything wrong, I certainly would not have signed it."" When asked whether the atmosphere in the dressing room was tense after the show, Tarrant replied: ""No, not at all. They seemed as normal as people who have just won a million pounds would be in the situation."" However, he said that on his way to the dressing room, ""I had been told there had been quite an unpleasant exchange."" A member of the crew, Eve Winstanley, testified in court that Ingram seemed very ""unhappy"" for someone who had just won a million pounds. Celador employees produced and reviewed various compilation tapes, before and after contacting the police. Celador and their editing company, Editworks, retained all the tapes during the case and reproduced all tapes for court. In court, Smith confirmed that his company had previously produced a television programme involving witnesses about the case, for broadcast on ITV after the trial. This was subsequently broadcast on ITV a month after the trial as ""Tonight With Trevor McDonald – Major Fraud"", which was credited with over 17 million viewers. Two weeks later, the day after ""Major Fraud"" aired in the USA, the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic entitled ""The Final Answer"", which was credited with over 5 million viewers. Verdict. The trial judge summed up the case by stating to the jury that the tapes and Whitehurst were the two pieces of ""direct evidence"" offered by the prosecution before adding that, ""coincidences happen"". The foreman at first told the judge that they thought Ingram and Tecwen to be guilty but Diana not. He was informed that since all three were co-defendants, this was not an acceptable conclusion. He then returned to the jury room and emerged some twenty minutes later saying that they now thought her guilty as well. Immediately after the jury's verdict, the judge sentenced the Ingrams to an 18 months imprisonment suspended for two years while Whittock received a 12-month suspended sentence. Personal life. Ingram currently lives in Easterton, Wiltshire with his wife, Diana, and their three daughters, Portia, Rosie and Hester. After leaving the Army, Ingram embarked on a career as a novelist. He has written two novels to date; ""The Network"", published on 27 April 2006 and ""Deep Siege"", published on 8 October 2007.  He also repairs computers for a living, as well as assisting his wife with her handmade jewellery business. Ingram and his wife declared bankruptcy in October 2004. He has said that despite everything, he feels free as he is ""spending more time with his family"" and that he ""wouldn't swap it for anything"".  Ingram was accused of assaulting an unnamed 13-year old boy which occurred on 30 April 2006. The unnamed boy, who was with five other people, was reported to have mocked him by coughing into Ingram's face. Ingram stated during the trial that his family had suffered over 60 acts of assault, aggression, abuse and vandalism over a period of five years for which he described his life as a ""living hell"". Ingram was found guilty in April 2007 and was given an absolute discharge. In 2010, Ingram suffered a freak gardening accident whilst he was mowing the lawn at his home. He apparently slipped whilst using his petrol lawnmower in his garden and the lawnmower sliced three of the toes off his left foot. "
wikipedia-386115," Millionaire  A millionaire (originally and sometimes still millionnaire) is an individual whose net worth or wealth is equal to or exceeds one million units of currency. It can also be a person who owns one million units of currency in a bank account or savings account. Depending on the currency, a certain level of prestige is associated with being a millionaire, which makes that amount of wealth a goal for some, and almost unattainable for others. In countries that use the short scale number naming system, a billionaire is someone who has at least a thousand times a million dollars, euros, or the currency of the given country (i.e. $1,000,000,000). In contrast, a billionaire in countries that use the long scale number naming system would be someone who has at least a million times a million units of currency (i.e. $1,000,000,000,000). The increasing number of millionaires is partially due to prevailing economics, especially inflation; as the individual value of each unit of currency decreases, achieving a million of these becomes easier. The purchasing power of a million US dollars in 1959 is equivalent to 7.3 million dollars in 2009. Increasingly, the term denotes the status of high wealth. American sociologist Leonard Beeghley classifies all households with net worth exceeding USD 1 million as ""The Rich"". As of 2008, there were 10 million people around the globe who are classified as U.S.-dollar millionaires. Terminology. The word was first used (as ""millionnaire"", double ""n"") in French in 1719 by Steven Fentiman, and is first recorded in English (""millionaire"", as a French term) in a letter of Lord Byron of 1816, then in print in ""Vivian Grey"", a novel of 1826 by Benjamin Disraeli. An earlier English word ""millionary"" was used in 1786 by Thomas Jefferson while serving as Minister to France; he wrote: ""The poorest labourer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest Millionary"". The first American printed use of the word is thought to be in an obituary of New York tobacco manufacturer Pierre Lorillard II in 1843. The increasing prevalence of people with more and more money has given rise to additional terms to further differentiate millionaires. A multimillionaire has a net worth of more than 2 million units of currency, a decamillionaire has a net worth of more than 10 million units of currency, and a hectomillionaire has a net worth of more than 100 million units of currency. The term centimillionaire has become synonymous with hectomillionaire in America, despite the centi- prefix meaning 1/100, not 100, in the metric system.  While statistics regarding financial assets and net worth are presented by household, the term is also often used to describe only the individual who has amassed the assets as millionaire. That is, even though the term statistically refers only to households, common usage is often in reference only to an individual. Net worth vs. financial assets. Recently, there has been some controversy over how to correctly determine a person's status as a millionaire. One of the two most commonly used measurements is net worth, which counts the total value of all property owned by a household minus the household's debts. According to this definition, a household owning an $800k home, $50k of furnishings, two cars worth $60k, a $60k retirement savings account, $45k in mutual funds, and a $325k vacation home with a $250k mortgage, $40k in car loans, and $25k in credit card debt would be worth about $1,085,000; and every individual in this household would thus be a millionaire. However, according to the net financial assets measurement used for some specific applications (such as evaluating an investor's expected tolerance for risk for stockbroker ethics), equity in one's principal residence is excluded, as are lifestyle assets, such as the car and furniture. Therefore the above example household would only have net financial assets of $80,000. Another term used is ""net investable assets"" or working capital. These practitioners may use the term ""millionaire"" to mean somebody who is free to invest a million units of currency through them as broker. For similar reasons, those who market goods, services, and investments to high net worth individuals (HNWIs) are careful to specify a net worth ""not counting principal residence."" At the end of 2011, there were around 5.1 million HNWIs in the US, while at the same time, there were 11 million millionaires in a total of 3.5 million millionaire households, including those 5.1 million HNWIs. In the real estate bubble up to 2007, average house prices in some U.S. regions exceeded $1 million, but many homeowners owed large amounts to banks holding mortgages on their homes. For this reason there are many people in million-dollar homes whose net worth is far short of a million—-in some cases the net worth is actually negative. Influence. While millionaires constitute only a small percentage of the population, they hold substantial control over economic resources with the most powerful and prominent individuals usually ranking among them. Also, the total amount of money held by millionaires can equal the same amount of money held by a far higher number of poor people. The Gini coefficient, and other measures in economics, estimated for each country, are useful for determining how many of the poorest people have the equivalent total wealth of the few richest in the country. ""Forbes"" and ""Fortune"" magazines maintain lists of people based on their net worth and are generally considered authorities on the subject. According to ""Forbes"" latest annual list of the World's Billionaires published in March 2008 there are currently 1125 members of the exclusive Billionaire's club (see US-dollar billionaires in the world). Sixteen percent of millionaires inherited their fortunes. Forty-seven percent of millionaires are business owners. Twenty-three percent of the world's millionaires got that way through paid work, consisting mostly of skilled professionals or managers. Millionaires are, on average, 61 years old with $3.05 million in assets. Historical worth. Depending on how it is calculated, a million US dollars in 1900 is equivalent to 2006 US dollars of  Thus one would need to have a little over twenty million dollars today to have the purchasing power of a US millionaire in 1900, or more than a hundred million dollars to have the same impact on the US economy. Multimillionaire. Another commonly used term is ""multimillionaire"". As the term implies, ""multimillionaire"" applies to those individuals residing in households with a net worth or wealth of two million or more units of currency. Only a small minority of households are indeed multimillionaire households. The term also has a more prestigious connotation than ""millionaire"". Roughly 1.0% of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) can also correctly be identified as ultra-high-net-worth individuals (ultra-HNWIs), those who reside in households with a net worth or wealth of $30 million or more. There are approximately 95,000 ultra-HNWIs in the world with 61,600 or 64.8% residing in the United States and Europe. Number of millionaires in the world. The ""World Wealth Report"" is a report on individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million in all assets except their primary residence. The report is compiled annually by Capgemini for RBC Wealth Management (as of 2012. Previously, the report was compiled for Merrill Lynch). World Wealth Report 2007 – ""The 11th annual World Wealth Report from Merrill Lynch/Capgemini finds the World’s High Net Worth (HNW) population growing to 9.5 million with their assets rising to $37.2 trillion."" The number of U.S. households with a net worth of $1 million or more, not including first homes, fell by 2.5 million to 6.7 million in 2008, according to the Spectrum Group report, as reported by Reuters. After the 27 percent drop, the number of millionaires is at the lowest level since 2003, when the millionaire population stood at 6.2 million. The S&P 500 stock index has lost over half its value since the stock market peaked in October 2007, wiping billions from savings, while wealthy households also saw declines in the value of other assets such as property. From the housing market peak in the second quarter of 2006, home prices have plummeted 26.7 percent through December, according to Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index. The number of U.S. households with a net worth over $5 million, again not including first homes, fell by 28 percent to 840,000. Some growth in international wealth and the number of high net worth individuals can be attributed to the weakness of the US dollar, as stated in the report. According to the World Wealth Report 2010, the number of millionaires in Asia Pacific (Asia minus the Middle East) surpassed Europe’s for the first time in 2009  Number of millionaires by country. The following is a list of the countries with the most number of millionaires in US$ worldwide according to the London-based wealth consultancy WealthInsight. Number of millionaires by city. The following is a list of the cities with the most number of millionaires in US$ worldwide. United States. There is a wide disparity in the estimates of the number of millionaires residing currently in the United States.  A quarterly report prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit on behalf of Barclays Wealth in 2007 estimated that there were 16,600,000 millionaires in the USA.At the end of 2011, there were around 5.1 million HNWIs in the US, while at the same time, there were 11 million millionaires in a total of 3.5 million millionaire households, including those 5.1 million HNWIs. According to TNS Financial Services, as reported by CNN Money, 2 million households in the US alone had a net worth of at least $1 million excluding primary residences in 2005. According to TNS, as of mid-2006 the number of millionaire US households was 9.3 million, with an increase of half a million since 2005. Millionaire households thus constituted roughly seven percent of all American households. The study also found that half of all millionaire households in the US were headed by retirees. In 2004 the United States saw a ""33 percent increase over the 6.2 million households that met that criteria in 2003,"" fueled largely by the country's real estate boom. A report by Capgemini for Merrill Lynch on the other hand stated that as of 2007 there are approximately 3,028,000 households in the United States who hold at least US$1 million in financial assets, excluding collectibles, consumables, consumer durables and primary residences. According to TNS Financial Services, Los Angeles County has the highest number of millionaires, totalling over 262,800 households as of mid-2006. Los Angeles County is also the largest single jurisdiction of any kind in the United States. Entertainment. Great wealth and its consequences is a popular theme in fiction. ""The Millionaire"" was the title of a 1955 TV series about an unseen man of wealth who gave away $1,000,000 to a different person each episode, and a 1931 motion picture about a retired millionaire who buys a gas station to ease his boredom. ""Millionaire"" is also a common nickname of the international quiz show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", first hosted in the UK by Chris Tarrant, and later in the U.S. by Regis Philbin and Meredith Vieira. ""Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire"" also aired in the U.S., where contestants could win a total of $10,000,000. Many reality television shows offer one million dollars as first prize. "
wikipedia-386117," Scotch egg  A Scotch egg consists of a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in bread crumbs and baked. Origin. The London department store Fortnum & Mason claims to have invented Scotch eggs in 1738, but they may have been inspired by the Moghul dish ""nargisi kofta"" (""Narcissus meatballs""). The earliest printed recipe is the 1809 edition of Mrs. Rundell's ""A New System of Domestic Cookery."" Mrs. Rundell—and later 19th-century authors—served them hot, with gravy. Serving. Scotch eggs are usually a picnic food and home-made. In the UK, packaged, plastic-wrapped Scotch eggs are commonly available in supermarkets, corner shops and motorway service stations. Miniature versions of Scotch eggs are also widely available in British supermarkets, and are sold under the name ""savoury eggs"", ""picnic eggs"", ""party eggs"", ""snack eggs"", ""egg bites"" or similar. These contain chopped egg or a quail's egg, rather than a whole chicken egg, and sometimes contain mayonnaise or chopped bacon. In the United States, many ""British-style"" pubs and eateries serve fresh-made Scotch eggs. These are usually served hot, with dipping sauces such as ranch dressing, hot sauce, or hot mustard sauce. At the Minnesota State Fair, true to fair tradition, Scotch eggs are served on a stick. Scotch eggs are available at most Renaissance Festivals from Maryland to Texas. In West Africa and Nigeria, some fast-food restaurants offer Scotch eggs alongside their other menu items. In the Netherlands and Belgium, Scotch eggs may also be called ""vogelnestje"" (""little bird's nest"") because they contain an egg. In the Philippines, quail eggs with orange breading are sold as street food dipped in vinegar, sweet and sour sauce or gravy. It is called kwek-kwek or tukneneng. Boiled duck eggs are also sold with orange breading. In Brazil they are sold in many ""botecos"" and called ""bolovo"". Variations and similar foodstuffs. Several local variations exist, such as the Manchester egg which uses a pickled egg wrapped in a mixture of pork meat and Lancashire black pudding, and the Worcester Egg, where the egg is first pickled in Worcestershire Sauce and then clad in a mixture of local sausage meat and white pudding. In the Netherlands a similar snack item called an eierbal is served hot at greasy spoon (""snackbar"") type establishments, mostly in the northern and eastern Netherlands. External links.

wikipedia-386120," Mineral water  Mineral water is water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds. Mineral water may be effervescent (i.e., ""sparkling"") due to contained gases. Traditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring sources, often referred to as ""taking the waters"" or ""taking the cure,"" at developed cities such as spas, baths, or wells. The term ""spa"" was used for a place where the water was consumed and bathed in; ""bath"" where the water was used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and ""well"" where the water was to be consumed. In modern times, it is far more common for mineral water to be bottled at the source for distributed consumption. Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not possible (because of exclusive commercial ownership rights). There are more than 3,000 brands of mineral water commercially available worldwide. In English, effervescent mineral water is often referred to as ""Vichy water,"" which refers to water from the springs at Vichy, France. Locations. Active tourist centres have grown up around many mineral water sites since ancient times, such as Hungary, Hisarya (Bulgaria), Bílina (Czech Republic), Vichy (France), Jermuk (Armenia), Yessentuki (Russia), Kislovodsk (Russia), Spa (Belgium), Krynica-Zdrój (Poland), Sulphur Baths (Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia), Bath (England), Khorog (Tajikistan), or Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic). In Romania, a country enjoying a privileged position as home to over one-third of the European mineral and thermal springs, resorts developed since antiquity in places such as Băile Herculane, Geoagiu or Slănic. Tourist development resulted in spa towns and hydropathic hotels (often shortened to ""hydros""). Composition. The more calcium and magnesium ions that are dissolved in water, the ""harder"" it is said to be; water with few dissolved calcium and magnesium ions is described as being ""soft"". The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS), originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water. In many places, however, the term ""mineral water"" is colloquially used to mean any bottled carbonated water or soda water, as opposed to tap water. In the European Union, bottled water may be called mineral water when it is bottled at the source and has undergone no or minimal treatment. Permitted is the removal of iron, manganese, sulfur and arsenic through decantation, filtration or treatment with ozone-enriched air, in so far as this treatment does not alter the composition of the water as regards the essential constituents which give it its properties. No additions are permitted except for carbon dioxide, which may be added, removed or re-introduced by exclusively physical methods. No disinfection treatment is permitted, nor is the addition of any bacteriostatic agents. "
wikipedia-386123," Barbershop music  Barbershop vocal harmony, as codified during the barbershop revival era (1940s–present), is a style of a cappella, or unaccompanied vocal music, characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created. Occasional traveling may be sung by fewer than four voice parts. According to the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), ""Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that resolve primarily around the circle of fifths, while making frequent use of other resolutions."" Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held (or sped up) ad libitum. The voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to the correspondingly named voice parts in classical music. Barbershop singing is performed both by men's and women's groups; the elements of the barbershop style and the names of the voice parts are the same for both. Ringing chords. The defining characteristic of the barbershop style is the ""ringing"" chord. This is a name for one specific and well-defined acoustical effect, also referred to as ""expanded sound,"" ""the angel's voice,"" ""the fifth voice"", ""the overtone"", or barbershop seventh. (The barbershopper's ""overtone"" is the same as the acoustic physicist's overtone or harmonic, although the numbers differ. The first overtone, at twice the fundamental frequency, is the second harmonic, etc. The undertone is the difference between the frequencies of two sung notes and is known as heterodyning). The physics and psychophysics of the effect are fairly well understood; it occurs when the upper harmonics in the individual voice notes, and the sum and difference frequencies resulting from nonlinear combinations within the ear, reinforce each other at a particular frequency, strengthening it so that it stands out separately above the blended sound. The effect is audible only on certain kinds of chords, and only when all voices are equally rich in harmonics and justly tuned and balanced. It is not heard in chords sounded on modern keyboard instruments, due to the slight tuning imperfection of the equal-tempered scale. Gage Averill writes that ""Barbershoppers have become partisans of this acoustic phenomenon"" and that ""the more experienced singers of the barbershop revival (at least after the 1940s) have self-consciously tuned their dominant seventh and tonic chords in just intonation to maximize the overlap of common overtones."" However, ""In practice, it seems that most leads rely on an approximation of an equal-tempered scale for the melody, to which the other voices adjust vertically in just intonation."" What is prized is not so much the ""overtone"" itself, but a unique sound whose achievement is most easily recognized by the presence of the ""overtone"". The precise synchrony of the waveforms of the four voices ""simultaneously"" creates the perception of a ""fifth voice"" while at the same time melding the four voices into a unified sound. The ringing chord is qualitatively different in sound from an ordinary musical chord e.g. as sounded on a tempered-scale keyboard instrument. Most elements of the ""revivalist"" style are related to the desire to produce these ringing chords. Performance is a cappella to prevent the distracting introduction of equal-tempered intonation, and because listening to anything but the other three voices interferes with a performer's ability to tune with the precision required. Barbershop arrangements stress chords and chord progressions that favor ""ringing"", at the expense of suspended and diminished chords and other harmonic vocabulary of the ragtime and jazz forms. The dominant seventh-type chord is so important to barbershop harmony that it is called the ""barbershop seventh"". BHS arrangers believe that a song should contain dominant seventh chords anywhere from 35 to 60 percent of the time (measured as a percentage of the duration of the song rather than a percentage of the chords present) to sound ""barbershop"". Historically barbershoppers may have used the word ""minor chord"" in a way that is confusing to those with musical training. Averill suggests that it was ""a shorthand for chord types other than major triads"", and says that the use of the word for ""dominant seventh-type chords and diminished chords"" was common in the late nineteenth century. A 1910 song called ""Play That Barber Shop Chord"" (often cited as an early example of ""barbershop"" in reference to music) contains the lines: 'Cause Mister when you start that minor partI feel your fingers slipping and a grasping at my heart,Oh Lord play that Barber shop chord! Averill notes the hints of rapture, ""quasi-religion"" and erotic passion in the language used by barbershoppers to describe the emotional effect. He quotes Jim Ewin as reporting ""a tingling of the spine, the raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, the spontaneous arrival of goose flesh on the forearm ... the fifth note has almost mysterious propensities. It's the consummation devoutly wished by those of us who love Barbershop harmony. If you ask us to explain why we love it so, we are hard put to answer; that's where our faith takes over."" Averill notes too the use of the language of addiction, ""there's this great big chord that gets people hooked."" An early manual was entitled ""A Handbook for Adeline Addicts"". He notes too that ""barbershoppers almost never speak of 'singing' a chord, but almost always draw on a discourse of physical work and exertion; thus, they 'hit', 'chop', 'ring', 'crack', and 'swipe.' Vocal harmony is interpreted as an embodied musicking. Barbershoppers never lose sight (or sound) of its physicality."" Historical origins. In the last half of the 19th century, U.S. barbershops often served as community centers – a place where most men would gather. Barbershop quartets originated with African American men socializing in barbershops; they would harmonize while waiting their turn, vocalizing in spirituals, folk songs and popular songs. This generated a new style, consisting of unaccompanied, four-part, close-harmony singing. Later, white minstrel singers adopted the style, and in the early days of the recording industry, their performances were recorded and sold. Early standards included songs such as ""Shine On, Harvest Moon"", ""Hello, My Baby"", and ""Sweet Adeline"". Barbershop music was very popular between 1900 and 1919 but gradually faded into obscurity in the 1920s. Barbershop harmonies remain in evidence in the a cappella music of the black church. The iconic barbershop quartets are typically dressed in bright colors, boaters and vertical stripe vests, though costuming and attire can vary. Organizations. Barbershop Harmony Society. The revival of a cappella singing was taken up again around 1938 when a tax lawyer named Owen C. Cash decided that for the art to die out would be a shame. He garnered support from an investment banker called Rupert I. Hall. Both came from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cash was a true partisan of quartet singing who advertised the fact that he did not want a cappella to fall by the wayside. Cash had struck a chord, albeit unwittingly, and soon, across North America, men responded in their thousands and later in the same year the ""Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America"" was set up, known by the abbreviation S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. at a time when many institutions in the United States were in the habit of using multiple initials to denote their function. The group adopted the alternate name ""Barbershop Harmony Society"" early in its history. While its legal name has never changed, it changed its official brand name to ""Barbershop Harmony Society"" in 2004. ""Sharp Harmony"", a Norman Rockwell painting, appeared on the cover of ""The Saturday Evening Post"" magazine issue dated September 26, 1936; it depicts a barber and three clients enjoying an a cappella song. The image was adopted by SPEBSQSA in its promotion of the art. Female barbershop music. Traditionally, the word ""barbershop"" has been used to encompass both men's and women's quartets singing in the barbershop style. Harmony, Inc. calls itself ""International Organization of Women Barbershop Singers"" while Sweet Adelines International calls itself ""a worldwide organization of women singers committed to advancing the musical art form of barbershop harmony."" Organization. Singing a cappella music in the barbershop style is a hobby enjoyed by men and women worldwide. The hobby is practiced mostly within one of the three main barbershop associations, which have a combined membership in the neighborhood of eighty thousand. The primary men's organization in the US and Canada is the Barbershop Harmony Society. Women have two organizations in North America, Sweet Adelines International and Harmony Incorporated. ""Sweet Adelines, Inc"" was founded in 1945 by Edna Mae Anderson of Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Harmony, Incorporated"" was formed in 1959 by five chapters that split from Sweet Adelines in 1957 over a dispute regarding admission of non-Caucasian members. SPEBSQSA and Sweet Adelines at that time restricted their membership to whites, but both opened membership to all races a few years later. All three organizations comprise choruses and quartets that perform and compete regularly throughout the US and Canada, and Sweet Adelines International also has a portion of its membership outside North America. Organizations affiliated with the Barbershop Harmony Society and Harmony Incorporated exist in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Spain, South Africa, Scandinavia, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and elsewhere. Some national and regional barbershop groups include: A worldwide association for mixed groups, the Mixed Harmony Barbershop Quartet Association, was established in 1995 to reflect the growing popularity of male-female barbershop singing. Notable artists. Quartets. A barbershop quartet is an ensemble of four people who sing a cappella in the exacting barbershop music genre. In North America most male barbershop quartet singers belong to the Barbershop Harmony Society, while most female barbershop quartet singers are in either Sweet Adelines International or Harmony, Inc. Similar organizations have sprung up in many other countries. Most barbershop quartet singers also choose to sing in a chorus. Choruses. A barbershop chorus sings a cappella music in the barbershop style. Most barbershop choruses belong to a larger association of practitioners such as the Barbershop Harmony Society, Sweet Adelines International or Harmony, Inc. In the Barbershop Harmony Society, a chorus is the main performing aspect of each chapter. Choruses may have as few as 12 or as many as 150 members singing. Choruses normally sing with a director, as distinct from quartets. It is not uncommon for a new quartet to form within a chorus, or for an established quartet affiliated with a given chorus to lose a member (to death, retirement, or relocation) and recruit a replacement from the ranks of the chorus. Choruses can also provide ""spare parts"" to temporarily replace a quartet member who is ill or temporarily out of town. Unlike a quartet, a chorus need not have equal numbers singing each voice part. The ideal balance in a chorus is about 40% bass, 30% lead, 20% baritone and 10% tenor singers. Filling the gap between the chorus and the quartet is what is known as a VLQ or Very Large Quartet, in which more than four singers perform together, with two or more voices on some or all of the four parts. A VLQ possesses greater flexibility than a standard quartet, since they can perform even with one or more singers missing, as long as all four parts are covered. Like a normal quartet, a VLQ usually performs without a director. Barbershop Harmony Australia. The Blenders, from Gold Coast, Queensland, have won the BHA Chorus Competition eight times (1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007) and runners-up three times (1991, 2009 and 2011). Irish Association of Barbershop Singers. Ten times male chorus champions The Polyphonics from Cork. Typical barbershop songs. Barbershop Harmony Society's Barberpole Cat Songs ""Polecats""—12 songs which all Barbershop Harmony Society members are encouraged to learn as a shared canonic repertoire—all famous, traditional examples of the barbershop genre: Examples of other songs popular in the barbershop genre are: While these traditional songs still play a part in barbershop today, barbershop music also includes more current titles. Most music can be arranged in the barbershop style, and there are many arrangers within the aforementioned societies with the skills to include the barbershop chord structure in their arrangements. Today's barbershop quartets and choruses sing a variety of music from all eras—show tunes, pop, and even rock music has been arranged for choruses and quartets, making them more attractive to younger singers.

wikipedia-386136," Little Caesars Pizza Bowl  The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl (known as the Motor City Bowl until 2009) is a post-season college football bowl game certified by the NCAA that has been played annually since 1997. The first five games (1997–2001) were played at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. Starting in 2002, the game was moved to 65,000-seat Ford Field in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Ford Field is home to the NFL's Detroit Lions, and played host to Super Bowl XL.  The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl features a bowl-eligible team from the Mid-American Conference (usually the winner of the MAC Championship Game, although that team is not required to accept the bid; prior to the formation of the bowl the MAC champion earned an automatic bid to the Las Vegas Bowl) playing a bowl-eligible team from the Big Ten Conference. If the Big Ten does not have an eligible team, the game will feature a team from the Sun Belt that meets the NCAA requirement of at least six wins. In the event that the Sun Belt does not have an available team, an at-large team can be chosen.  The game was jointly sponsored by the ""Big Three"" automakers in Detroit from 1998 to 2007 (Ford, General Motors and Chrysler). Starting with the 2008 game, Chrysler was replaced by the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights as a presenting sponsor. In 2009, Little Caesars became the title sponsor of the game after General Motors and Chrysler reorganized under bankruptcy protection. Ford remained as a sponsor. In 2011, Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and the UAW are committing $100,000 together to become the presenting sponsor of the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl at Ford Field. Little Caesar Enterprises Inc. and its franchisees remain the title sponsor.  With the help of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing, Ford, General Motors and Little Caesars they hope to get the fifth Big Ten selection (they currently have the eighth selection) by petitioning the Big Ten Conference to allow it to get a higher pick before the current deal expires in 2013. The then-named-Motor City Bowl marked the first bowl game held in the Detroit area since the Cherry Bowl in 1984–85. It is the only Division I college bowl game played in the Midwest United States. A bowl record crowd of 60,624 fans witnessed the 2007 bowl game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Central Michigan Chippewas. On April 12, 2010, it was announced that the Big Ten Conference has extended its affiliation with the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl (Big Ten no. 8) through the 2013 season. Also the Sun Belt Conference and the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl have agreed to a secondary tie-in that will allow a Sun Belt Conference team to play in the Detroit-based game should the Big Ten Conference not have an available bowl-eligible team to play.  ESPN has televised the game since its inception. The Total Attendance For The Motor City/Little Caesars Pizza Bowl is 714,665 (as of 09/04/2013) "
wikipedia-386138," Homothetic transformation  In mathematics, a homothety (or homothecy, or homogeneous dilation) is a transformation of an affine space determined by a point ""S"" called its ""center"" and a nonzero number ""λ"" called its ""ratio"", which sends in other words it fixes ""S"", and sends any ""M"" to another point ""N"" such that the segment ""SN"" is on the same line as ""SM"", but scaled by a factor ""λ"". In Euclidean geometry homotheties are the similarities that fix a point and either preserve (if ) or reverse (if ) the direction of all vectors. Together with the translations, all homotheties of an affine (or Euclidean) space form a group, the group of dilations or homothety-translations. These are precisely the affine transformations with the property that the image of every line ""L"" is a line parallel to ""L"". In projective geometry, a homothetic transformation is a similarity transformation that leaves the line at infinity pointwise invariant. In Euclidean geometry, a homothety of ratio ""λ"" multiplies distances between points by |""λ""| and all areas by ""λ""2. The first number is called the ""ratio of magnification"" or ""dilation factor"" or ""scale factor"" or ""similitude ratio"". Such a transformation can be called an enlargement if the scale factor exceeds 1. The above mentioned fixed point ""S"" is called ""homothetic center"" or ""center of similarity"" or ""center of similitude"" Homothety and uniform scaling. If the homothetic center ""S"" happens to coincide with the origin ""O"" of the vector space (""S"" ≡ ""O""), then every homothety with scale factor ""λ"" is equivalent to a uniform scaling by the same factor, which sends As a consequence, in the specific case in which ""S"" ≡ ""O"", the homothety becomes a linear transformation, which preserves not only the collinearity of points (straight lines are mapped to straight lines), but also vector addition and scalar multiplication.

wikipedia-386140," Spectrum HoloByte  Spectrum HoloByte, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher originally based in Alameda, California. The company was founded in 1983 and was most famous for its simulation games, notably the ""Falcon"" series of flight simulators and ""Vette!"", a driving simulator from 1989. Spectrum Holobyte published games for many platforms, including home computers of the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM PC compatibles, and some video game consoles. The company was the publisher of the ""Solitaire Royale"", the first computer card solitaire program. They were the first to bring ""Tetris"" to gamers outside the Soviet Union and ""Sokoban"" to gamers outside Japan. It was also the distributor for Domark games before Domark set up its own US operations in San Mateo, California. In 1993, Spectrum HoloByte acquired MicroProse. For the following years, games from both companies were published under their respective brands, but in 1996 all titles were consolidated under the MicroProse brand. The merged company was acquired by Hasbro Interactive in 1998, and what had been Spectrum HoloByte ceased to exist when the development studio in Alameda was closed in 1998. Hasbro subsequently sold all the assets of the various Hasbro Interactive studios to Infogrames, now Atari. The chairman of Spectrum Holobyte, Gilman Louie, also founded Nexa Corporation, a developer of entertainment software, which went on to merge with Spectrum Holobyte. "
wikipedia-386145," New Orleans Bowl  The New Orleans Bowl is an NCAA-sanctioned post-season college football bowl game that has been played annually at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana since 2001. The game was sponsored by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts from 2002 to 2004 and was officially called the Wyndham New Orleans Bowl. R+L Carriers replaced Wyndham as the sponsor in 2006, and thus it became officially known as the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl. The game pits a team from Conference USA versus a team from the Sun Belt Conference. From the beginning of the New Orleans Bowl until recently that automatically went to the Sun Belt champion, but since the conference earned a second bid, to the GoDaddy.com Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, the bowl now has the first choice of which team to take before the GoDaddy.com Bowl. Since the agreement, the Sun Belt champion has played in that game once. If Conference USA does not have enough bowl eligible teams the bowl will choose an at-large team, which they did in 2011 when Mountain West Conference member San Diego State was picked to play. In 2001, the Sun Belt signed a temporary contract to play against the 5th-ranked team from the Mountain West Conference.  In the inaugural game, the came to New Orleans, and defeated , 45–20. Starting in 2002, the Sun Belt signed a multi-year contract with Conference USA, and the two conferences began their bowl rivalry that December, when played then-Conference USA member Cincinnati (and won). Due to damage by Hurricane Katrina to the Superdome, where the game is usually played, the 2005 game was played on December 20 in Lafayette, Louisiana at Cajun Field on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and was dubbed the New Orleans Bowl at Lafayette. The game returned to the Superdome on December 22, 2006, with a new corporate sponsor in freight company R+L Carriers, renaming the game the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl. The game featured , co-champions of the Sun Belt Conference facing Rice, making their first bowl game visit in 45 years, their last appearance being the . Troy defeated Rice, 41–17. The current champions of the New Orleans Bowl are the Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns who beat East Carolina 43–34 for their second straight victory in this bowl game. Attendance at the 2012 bowl game again set a record making the New Orleans bowl one of the best attended of the non-BCS bowl games in 2012. "
wikipedia-386146," John Dingell  John David Dingell, Jr. (born July 8, 1926) is an American politician who has been a member of the United States House of Representatives continuously since entering Congress on . He is a member of the Democratic Party. On he reached 20,997 days of membership, surpassing Robert Byrd as the longest-serving member of Congress in history. Dingell is a long-time member and former Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The longest-serving member of Congress, Dingell has been in office for . Dingell is also the longest-currently-serving member of Congress, Having remained in the House of Representatives for his entire Congressional career, he is also the longest ever to serve exclusively in the House, the longest-serving Dean of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Dean of the Michigan congressional delegation. Dingell is one of two World War II veterans still serving in Congress; the other is Texas Congressman Ralph Hall. Dingell's district was first in western Detroit, but redistricting has successively moved him further into the city's western suburbs. Since 2013, he has represented . Early life, education, and early career. Dingell was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the son of Grace (née Bigler) and John D. Dingell, Sr. (1894–1955), who represented Michigan's 15th district from 1933 to 1955. His father was of Polish descent and his mother had Swiss and Scots-Irish ancestry. His father's original surname had been Dzieglewicz. John D. Dingell, Sr. changed his name for his campaign for office with the slogan 'Ring (in) with Dingell.' In Washington, D.C., John, Jr. attended Georgetown Preparatory School and then the House Page School when he served as a page for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1938 to 1943. He was on the floor of the House when President Roosevelt gave his famous speech after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In 1944, at the age of 18, Dingell joined the United States Army. He rose to the rank of Second Lieutenant and received orders to take part in the first wave of a planned invasion of Japan in November 1945; the Congressman has said President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb to end the war saved his life. He then attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1949 and a J.D. in 1952. He was a lawyer in private practice, a research assistant to U.S. Circuit Court judge Theodore Levin, a Congressional employee, a forest ranger, and assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne County until 1955. U.S. House of Representatives. Elections. In 1955, John, Sr. died and John, Jr. won a special election to succeed him. He won a full term in 1956 and has been reelected 29 times, including runs in 1988 and 2006 with no Republican opponent. He has only received less than 62% of the vote on two occasions. In 1994 when the Republican Revolution swept the Republicans into the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954, Dingell received 59% of the vote. In 2010 when the Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives, Dingell received 57% of the vote. Between them, he and his father have represented the southeastern Michigan area for 80 years. His district was numbered as the 15th District from 1955 to 1965, when redistricting merged it into the Dearborn-based 16th District; in the primary that year, he defeated 16th District incumbent John Lesinski, Jr. In 2002, redistricting merged Dingell's 16th District with the Washtenaw County and western Wayne County-based 13th District, represented by fellow Democratic Representative Lynn Rivers, whom Dingell also bested in the Democratic primary. The current 15th District ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/mi15_109.gif]) includes Wayne County suburbs generally southwest of Detroit, the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti areas in Washtenaw County, and all of Monroe County. For many years, Dingell represented much of western Detroit itself, though Detroit's declining population and the growth of its suburbs has pushed all of Detroit into the districts of fellow Democratic representatives, including John Conyers. Dingell has always won re-election by double-digit margins, although the increasing conservatism of the white suburbs of Detroit since the 1970s led to several serious Republican challenges in the 1990s. He has won his last two elections, however, with over 70 percent of the vote. With the retirement of Jamie L. Whitten, the death of William Natcher, and the defeat of Texas Representative Jack Brooks at the start of a new Congress in January 1995, he became the Dean of the United States House of Representatives even though fellow Representative Sidney Yates had served non-consecutive terms earlier than Dingell. He is one of three people to serve in the House for 50 years, the others being Whitten and Carl Vinson. Tenure. Dingell is generally classified as a liberal member of the Democratic Party and throughout his career he has been a leading Congressional supporter of organized labor, social welfare measures and traditional progressive policies. At the beginning of every Congress, Dingell introduces a bill providing for a national health insurance system, the same bill that his father proposed while he was in Congress. Dingell also strongly supported Bill Clinton's managed-care proposal early in his administration. On some issues, though, he reflects the conservative values of his largely Catholic and working-class district. He supported the Vietnam War until 1971. Although he backed the Johnson Administration's civil rights bills, he opposed expanding school desegregation to Detroit suburbs via mandatory busing. He takes a fairly moderate position on abortion. He has worked to balance clean air legislation with the need to protect manufacturing jobs. An avid sportsman and hunter, he strongly opposes gun control, and is a former board member of the National Rifle Association. For many years, Dingell has received an A+ rating from the NRA.  The political analyst Michael Barone wrote of Dingell in 2002: On March 23, 2010, Dingell was interviewed by WJR-AM Detroit radio host Paul W. Smith about the newly-signed federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Responding to subsequent controversy over his use of the phrase ""control the people"", Rep. Dingell stated, ""I was referring to the insurance companies who we must do a better job of overseeing."" On December 13, 2005, Dingell was honored at the White House with a Presidential lunch for his 50th anniversary in Congress. On December 15, 2005, on the floor of the House, Dingell read a poem sharply critical of, among other things, Fox News, Bill O'Reilly and the so-called ""War on Christmas"". Along with John Conyers, in April 2006, Dingell brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case (""Conyers v. Bush"") was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing. After winning re-election in 2008 for his 28th consecutive term, Dingell surpassed Whitten's record for having the longest tenure in the House on February 11, 2009. In honor of the record, Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm declared February 11, 2009, to be John Dingell Day.  As of June 9, 2013, Dingell had served with 2,445 different U.S. Representatives in his career. During his first stint as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dingell was regarded by analysts as one of the four or five most powerful members of the House. Dingell is well known for his approach to Congressional oversight of the executive branch. He has subpoenaed numerous government officials to testify before the committee and grilled them for hours. Insisting that all who testify before his committee do so under oath, thus exposing them to perjury charges if they did not tell the truth, he and his committee have uncovered numerous instances of corruption and waste, such as the use of $600 toilet seats at the Pentagon. He also claims that the committee's work led to resignations of many Environmental Protection Agency officials, and uncovered information that led to legal proceedings that sent many Food and Drug Administration officials to jail. After serving as the committee's ranking Democratic member for 12 years, Dingell regained the chairmanship in 2007. According to ""Newsweek"", he had wanted to investigate the George W. Bush Administration's handling of port security, the Medicare prescription drug program and Dick Cheney's energy task force. ""Time"" magazine has stated that he had intended to oversee legislation that addresses global warming and climate change caused by carbon emissions from automobiles, energy companies and industry (citation: June 2007 issue, Time magazine). Dingell lost the chairmanship for the 111th Congress to Congressman Henry Waxman of California in a Democratic caucus meeting on November 20, 2008. Waxman mounted a challenge against Dingell on grounds that Dingell was stalling certain environmental legislation, which would have tightened vehicle emissions standards—something that could be detrimental to the Big Three automobile manufacturers that constitute a major source of employment in Dingell's district. Dingell was given the title of Chairman Emeritus in a token of appreciation of his years of service on the committee. In the 1980s, Dingell led a series of Congressional hearings to pursue alleged scientific fraud by Thereza Imanishi-Kari and Nobel Prize-winner David Baltimore. The NIH's fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity, charged Imanishi-Kari in 1991 of falsifying data and recommended that she be barred from receiving research grants for 10 years. Later, a newly-constituted HHS appeals panel of political appointees dismissed the charges against Imanishi-Kari. The findings and negative publicity surrounding them forced David Baltimore to resign as president of Rockefeller University and caused Imanishi-Kari to lose a tenure-track position. The story of the case is described in Daniel Kevles' 1998 book ""The Baltimore Case"", in a chapter of Horace Freeland Judson's 2004 book """", and in a 1993 study by Serge Lang, updated and reprinted in his book ""Challenges"" (New York: Springer-Verlag; 1997). From 1991 to 1995 Dingell's staff investigated claims that Robert Gallo had used samples supplied to him by Luc Montagnier to fraudulently claim to have discovered the AIDS virus. The report concluded that Gallo had engaged in fraud and that the NIH covered up his misappropriation of work by the French team at the Institut Pasteur. The report contended that: The report was never formally published as a subcommittee report because of the 1995 change in control of the House from Democratic to Republican. Other accusations against Gallo were dropped, and while Montagnier's group is considered to be the first to isolate the virus, Gallo's has been recognized as first to prove that this virus was the cause of AIDS. For his conduct regarding environmental issues during the 109th Congress the lobby group League of Conservation Voters has awarded Dingell its highest rating, 100%. According to the LCV, Dingell voted ""pro-environment"" on twelve out of twelve issues the group deemed critical; they also praised him for introducing, along with representatives James Oberstar and Jim Leach, an amendment compelling the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rescind a directive issued in 2003 by the Bush Administration ""requiring EPA staff to get permission from headquarters before protecting 'isolated' water bodies like vernal pools, prairie potholes, playa lakes and bogs,"" which provide ""critical wildlife habitat, store flood water, and protect drinking water supplies."" Dingell is also a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Dingell has opposed raising mandatory automobile fuel efficiency standards, which he helped to write in the 1970s. Instead, he has indicated that he intends to pursue a regulatory structure that takes greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption into account. In a July 2007 interview with thehill.com, he said “I have made it very plain that I intend to see to it that CAFE is increased” and pointed out that his plan would have Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards increased tantamount to those in the Senate bill recently passed. In November 2007, working with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Dingell helped draft an energy bill that would mandate 40% increase in fuel efficiency standards. In July 2007, Dingell indicated he planned to introduce a new tax on carbon usage in order to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. The policy has been criticized by some, as polling numbers show voters may be unwilling to pay for the changes. A ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial claimed that vehicle emissions standards that he supports will not yield any substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings. Dingell has drawn criticism for his ties to the automotive industry. The three largest contributors to his campaign for the 2006 election cycle are political action committees, employees, or other affiliates of General Motors, Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler; since 1989, intermediaries for these corporations have contributed more than $600,000 to his campaigns. Dingell also holds an unknown quantity, once more than $US 1 million, in assets through General Motors stock options and savings-stock purchase programs; his wife, Debbie Dingell, worked as a lobbyist for the corporation until they married. She then moved to an administrative position there. As of June 2007, Mrs. Dingell was executive director of Global Community Relations and Government Relation at GM and vice chair of the General Motors Foundation. Personal life. He is married to Deborah Dingell his second wife, who is 30 years his junior. He has four children from his first marriage (1952-1972) to Helen Henebry.  "
wikipedia-386163," Sde Boker  Sde Boker (, lit. ""Herding Field"") is a kibbutz in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Best known as the retirement home of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat HaNegev Regional Council. History. A large agricultural farm or small village existed here in the early Islamic period, from the late 7th century to the early 9th century. Remains of dozens of structures exist, including a mosque near which hundreds of Arabic inscriptions were found. The kibbutz was established on 15 May 1952.  In 1953 Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion resigned from office and moved to the kibbutz. Although he returned to politics in 1955, he continued to live in the kibbutz until his death in 1973, when he was buried nearby at Midreshet Ben-Gurion aside his wife Paula Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion moved to the kibbutz due to his vision of cultivating the arid Negev desert and building up its surrounding towns such as Yeruham and Dimona. He believed that eventually the Negev would be home to many Jews who would move to Israel, and he felt that Sde-Boker was a trailblazer and example for what should follow. In his official writings Ben-Gurion often mused about his efforts at rejuvenating the arid Negev: It is also well known for its Bedouin tents. Today Ben-Gurion's kibbutz home, ""Tzrif Ben-Gurion"", is a museum. "

Matrices. Let λ1, ..., λ""n"" be the (real or complex) eigenvalues of a matrix ""A"" ∈ C""n"" × ""n"". Then its spectral radius ρ(""A"") is defined as: The following lemma shows a simple yet useful upper bound for the spectral radius of a matrix: Lemma: Let formula_2 be a complex-valued matrix, ρ(""A"") its spectral radius and ||·|| a consistent matrix norm; then, for each ""k"" ∈ N: formula_3 ""Proof"": Let (v, λ) be an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for a matrix ""A"". By the sub-multiplicative property of the matrix norm, we get: and since v ≠ 0 for each λ we have and therefore The spectral radius is closely related to the behaviour of the convergence of the power sequence of a matrix; namely, the following theorem holds: Theorem: Let ""A"" ∈ C""n"" × ""n"" be a complex-valued matrix and ρ(""A"") its spectral radius; then Moreover, if ρ(""A"")>1, formula_9 is not bounded for increasing k values. ""Proof"": formula_10 Let (v, λ) be an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for matrix ""A"". Since we have: and, since by hypothesis v ≠ 0, we must have which implies |λ|  0, consider the matrix Then, obviously, and, by the previous theorem, That means, by the sequence limit definition, a natural number ""N1"" ∈ N exists such that which in turn means: or Let's now consider the matrix Then, obviously, and so, by the previous theorem,formula_47 is not bounded. This means a natural number ""N2"" ∈ N exists such that which in turn means: or Taking and putting it all together, we obtain: which, by definition, is Gelfand's formula leads directly to a bound on the spectral radius of a product of finitely many matrices, namely assuming that they all commute we obtain formula_54 Actually, in case the norm is consistent, the proof shows more than the thesis; in fact, using the previous lemma, we can replace in the limit definition the left lower bound with the spectral radius itself and write more precisely: Example: Let's consider the matrix whose eigenvalues are 5, 10, 10; by definition, its spectral radius is ρ(""A"")=10. In the following table, the values of formula_58 for the four most used norms are listed versus several increasing values of k (note that, due to the particular form of this matrix,formula_59): Bounded linear operators. For a bounded linear operator ""A"" and the operator norm ||·||, again we have A bounded operator (on a complex Hilbert space) called a spectraloid operator if its spectral radius coincides with its numerical radius. An example of such an operator is a normal operator. Graphs. The spectral radius of a finite graph is defined to be the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix. This definition extends to the case of infinite graphs with bounded degrees of vertices (i.e. there exists some real number C such that the degree of every vertex of the graph is smaller than C). In this case, for the graph formula_61 let formula_62 denote the space of functions formula_63 with formula_64. Let formula_65 be the adjacency operator of formula_66, i.e., formula_67. The spectral radius of G is defined to be the spectral radius of the bounded linear operator formula_68. "
wikipedia-386172," Harry Lauder  Sir Henry Lauder (4 August 1870 – 26 February 1950), known universally as Harry Lauder, was an international Scottish entertainer, described by Sir Winston Churchill as ""Scotland's greatest ever ambassador!"" Early life. Henry Lauder was born at Portobello, Edinburgh, where the family lived, in the home of his maternal grandfather, Henry McLennan. His father was John Currie Lauder, descended from the Lauders of the Bass, and his mother was Isabella Urquhart MacLeod McLennan, born in Arbroath to a family from the Black Isle. Harry's father John Lauder moved to Newbold, Derbyshire, in 1882 to take up a job designing china. John died of pneumonia a short while afterward, and Isabella and her five sons and two daughters moved to live in her brother's home in Arbroath. Though it was customary for children to begin working at the age of 11 or 12, Harry's mother was determined to continue Harry's education. He worked part-time at the local flax mill until he was 16, so he could attend school. The family later moved to the home of Isabella's brother in Lanarkshire, where Harry worked in the coal mines around Hamilton, Lanarkshire. On 19 June 1891, at age 21, Harry married Ann Vallance, daughter of a colliery manager at Hamilton. Harry's brother Matthew stood as his best man, and a year later, Harry served as Matthew's best man when he wedded Ann's sister, Catherine.  Entertainer. Lauder sang as he worked in the coal mines to help relieve the arduous nature of the work, and his fellow workers encouraged him to sing in local halls. While singing in nearby Larkhall, he received 5 shilling—the first time he was paid for singing. After more evenings singing in halls around Hamilton, he went to a weekly ""go-as-you please"" night held by Mrs. Christina Baylis at her Scotia Music Hall/Metropole Theatre in Glasgow. She advised him to gain experience by touring halls around the country with a concert party, which he did. This allowed him to quit the coal mines and turn to singing professionally. Lauder sang comedic and songs of Scotland and Ireland. In 1905 his success in leading the Howard & Wyndham pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, for which he wrote ""I Love a Lassie"", made him a national British star, and he obtained contracts with Sir Edward Moss and others. In 1911, he toured the United States where he commanded $1,000 a night. In 1912, he was top of the bill at Britain`s first ever Royal Command Variety performance, in front of King George V, organised by Alfred Butt. He was Britain`s best-known entertainer. He toured the world extensively during his forty-year career, including 22 trips to the United States—for which he had his own railroad train, the Harry Lauder Special—and made several trips to Australia, where his brother John had emigrated. He was, at one time, the highest-paid performer in the world, making the equivalent of £12,700 a night plus expenses, and was the first British artiste to sell a million records. Lauder's music appealed to all, including workers, merchants, royalty, and presidents. His understanding of life, its pathos and joys, endeared him to all. Beniamino Gigli and others commended his singing voice and clarity. Lauder usually performed in full 'Highland' regalia—Kilt, Sporran, Tam o' Shanter, and twisted walking stick—singing Scottish-themed songs (Roamin' in the Gloamin' etc.). On the negative side, this 'Romantic' image of the ever-bekilted 'music-hall' Scotsman who, in reality, bore little, if any, resemblance to the real thing, helped foster an image of Scotland that was not always flattering and even lent itself to some ridicule. Likewise, his penchant for telling stories and jokes involving the alleged parsimony of the Scots established an enduring but completely false image of his fellow countrymen. Some of the most generous philanthropists of the age, such as Andrew Carnegie and, before him, David Dale, were Scots, giving the lie to the theatrical Lauder version.  When World War I broke out, Lauder was in Melbourne on one of his Australian tours. During the war, he led successful fundraising efforts for war charities, organised a tour of music halls in 1915 for recruitment purposes, and brought his piano to the front lines where he entertained troops in France. Through his efforts in organising concerts and fundraising appeals he raised £1,000,000 to help servicemen return to health and civilian life, for which he was knighted in 1919.  He suffered personal tragedy during the war, when his only son, John (1891–1916), a captain in the 8th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was killed in action on 28 December 1916 at Poiziers. Harry wrote the song ""Keep Right on to the End of the Road"" in the wake of John's death. He had a monument for his son built in the little Lauder cemetery in Glenbranter (John Lauder was buried in France).  Winston Churchill stated that Lauder, ""...by his inspiring songs and valiant life, rendered measureless service to the Scottish race and to the British Empire."" His works. Sir Harry wrote most of his own songs, favourites of which were ""Roamin' in the Gloamin'"", ""I Love a Lassie"", ""A Wee Deoch-an-Doris"", and ""Keep Right on to the End of the Road"", which is used by Birmingham City Football Club as their club anthem. He starred in three British films: ""Huntingtower"" (1927), ""Auld Lang Syne"" (1929) and ""The End of the Road"" (1936). He also appeared in a test film for the Photokinema sound-on-disc process in 1921. This film is part of the UCLA Film and Television Archive collection, however, the disc is missing. In 1914, Lauder appeared in 14 Selig Polyscope experimental short sound films. In 1907, he appeared in a short film singing ""I Love a Lassie"" for British Gaumont. The British Film Institute has several reels of what appears to be an unreleased film ""All for the Sake of Mary"" (c. 1920) co-starring Effie Vallance and Harry Vallance. He wrote a number of books which ran into several editions, including ""Harry Lauder at Home and on Tour"" (1912), ""A Minstrel in France"" (1918), ""Between You and Me"" (1919), ""Roamin’ in the Gloamin’"" (1928 autobiography), ""My Best Scotch Stories"" (1929), ""Wee Drappies"" (1931) and ""Ticklin’ Talks"" (circa 1932). Portraits. Lauder is credited with giving the then 21 year-old portrait artist Cowan Dobson his opening into society by commissioning him, in 1915, to paint his portrait. This was considered to be so outstanding another commission came the following year to paint his son Captain John Lauder, and again another commission in 1921 to paint Sir Harry's wife, the latter portrait being after the style of John Singer Sargent. These three portraits remain in the family's possession. The same year Scottish artist James McBey painted another portrait of Sir Harry, today in the Glasgow Museums. In the tradition of the famous British magazine Vanity Fair there appeared numerous caricatures of Sir Harry Lauder. Of the more notable is one by Al Frueh (1880-1968) in 1911 and published in 1913 in the ""New York World"" magazine, another by Henry Mayo Bateman, now in London's National Gallery, and one by Alick P.F.Ritchie, for Players, in 1926, today in the London National Portrait Gallery (ref:NPG D2675).  Later years. Lady Ann Lauder died on 31 July 1927 and was buried next to her son's memorial at Glenbranter, Argyll. His niece, Margaret Lauder, MBE (1900–1966), moved in with him at his home, Laudervale (outside Dunoon), to care for him and be his companion in his last years. Sir Harry's final retirement was announced in 1935. However, he again entertained troops throughout Britain during World War II, despite his age, and made wireless broadcasts with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared immediately after the war to thank the crews of American food relief ships docking at Glasgow.  Death. Heirless, Lauder sold Glenbranter to the Forestry Commission and spent his last years at ""Lauder Ha"", his Strathaven home, where he died on 26 February 1950, aged 79. His funeral was widely reported. One of the chief mourners was Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton, who led the funeral procession and read the lesson. Sir Harry was interred with his mother and brother at Bent Cemetery, Hamilton.  Posthumous. Websites carry much of his material and the Harry Lauder Collection, amassed by entertainer Jimmy Logan, was bought for the nation and donated to the University of Glasgow. When the A199 Portobello bypass opened, it was named the ""Sir Harry Lauder Road"". On 28 July 1987, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, The Rt. Hon. John McKay, CBE, hosted a luncheon at the Edinburgh City Chambers, to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the granting of the Freedom of the City to Sir Harry Lauder, attended by family representative Gregory Lauder-Frost, who, on 4 August 2001, formally opened the new Sir Harry Lauder Memorial Garden at Portobello Town Hall, and was the principal commentator throughout the Saltire/BBC2 TV (Scotland) documentary entitled ""Something About Harry"" screened on 30 November 2005. On 29 September 2007, Lauder-Frost as guest-of-honour rededicated for another century the Burslem Golf Course & Club at Stoke-on-Trent, which had been formally opened on the same day in 1907 by Harry Lauder. In the 1990s, samples of recordings of Lauder were used on two tracks recorded by the Scottish folk/dance music artist Martyn Bennett. An ornamental cultivar of Common Hazel (Corylus avellana) has become known as Harry Lauder's Walking Stick or Corkscrew Hazel. It was noticed growing as part of a hedge in the 1800s and is now propagated by grafting. It gains this name from the fact Lauder regularly appeared with a crooked walking stick.  The song ""Dearie"" includes a reference to Harry Lauder.  "
wikipedia-386181," London South Bank University  London South Bank University (LSBU) is a public university located in London, United Kingdom. With over 25,000 students and 1,700 staff, it is based in the London Borough of Southwark, near the South Bank of the River Thames, from which it takes its name. Founded from charitable donations in 1892 as the ""Borough Polytechnic Institute"", it absorbed several other local colleges in the 1970s and 1990s, and achieved university status in 1992. LSBU is a post-1992 or new university and puts strong focus on their students' employability. The current Chancellor is investor Richard Farleigh and their Vice-Chancellor is Prof Martin Earwicker. History. 1892 to 1900. LSBU was founded in 1892 as the Borough Polytechnic Institute. It has since undergone several name changes, becoming the Polytechnic of the South Bank in 1970, South Bank Polytechnic in 1987, South Bank University in 1992 and London South Bank University in 2003. The University has also merged with a number of other educational institutions. In 1888, Edric Bayley, a local solicitor and member of the London School Board, set up the South London Polytechnics Committee whose members included the Lord Mayor of London, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Salisbury, Lord Rosebery and Sir Lyon Playfair. The Committee was successfully in persuading the Charity Commissioners to pledge to match whatever could be raised from the public, up to the sum of £200,000 to establish polytechnics in South London. A public meeting at Mansion House kick-started the public appeal and by 1891 enough money had been raised to establish polytechnics at Battersea and at Borough Road, Southwark, now LSBU. During 1890, the former buildings of Joseph Lancaster's British and Foreign Schools Society were purchased for the Borough Polytechnic Institute. In May that year, the South London Polytechnics Institutes Act was passed, so that by June 1891 the governing structure and general aims of the new Institute had been created. These aims were ""the promotion of the industrial skills, general knowledge, health, and well-being of young men and women"" and also for ""instruction suitable for persons intending to emigrate"". W. M. Richardson was chosen to be clerk to the Governing Body, Mr C. T. Millis was appointed as Headmaster, Miss Helen Smith was appointed Lady Superintendent and Mr Edric Bayley was appointed the first Chair of Governors. On 30 September 1892, the Borough Polytechnic Institute was officially opened by Lord Rosebery, with a remit to educate the local community in a range of practical skills. The Polytechnic was given a seal based on the Bridge House emblem of the City of London and a motto taken from Ecclesiastes — ""Do it with thy Might"". A gala event was held to mark the occasion which was widely reported in the press because of Lord Rosebery's speech on the banning of smoking in the new Institute. One of the speeches made included the hope that ""the Polytechnic would do its share towards perfecting many a valuable gem found in the slums of London"". The Polytechnic specialised in courses that reflected local trades including leather tanning, typography, metalwork, electrical engineering, laundry, baking, and boot & shoe manufacture. Instruction was also given in art, science, elocution, literature and general knowledge and the Polytechnic held public lectures by the likes of George Bernard Shaw, J. A. Hobson, Henry M. Stanley, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. On 10 October 1894, the National School of Bakery and Confectionery (later the National Bakery School) was opened with 78 pupils. In 1897, the Polytechnic was let to sightseers who wished to see the Diamond Jubilee parade for Queen Victoria. 1900 to 2000. In 1902 the Borough Road building was once again let to sightseers who wished to see the Coronation parade of King Edward VII. Through a donation from Mr Edric Bayley, the Edric Hall was built in 1908, along with the Lancaster Street extension buildings which gave the Polytechnic new bakery rooms, gymnasium, workshops and its triangular campus site. In 1911, the Governors commissioned Roger Fry to create a set of seven murals to decorate the student dining room with the theme of ""London on Holiday"". These comprised: In 1931, they were sold to the Tate Gallery. During the First World War, the Polytechnic manufactured munitions and gas masks for the war effort and ran courses for the army. After the War, the National Certificate system was taken up, engineering courses were offered to women in the 1920s and printing classes were dropped and run at Morley College. J. W. Bispham was elected the new Principal in 1922 when C. T. Millis retired and a rebuilding scheme was undertaken including a new facade for the Borough Road building. Class numbers increased to 8,682 students by 1927 and on 20 February 1930 the Duke of York officially opened the Polytechnic's new buildings. In 1933, Dr D.H. Ingall took over as Principal and a sports ground at Turney Road Dulwich was obtained for the Polytechnic. In 1933, farriery was dropped as it was too difficult to bring horses into the building. During the Second World War, a third of the Polytechnic's campus was destroyed or damaged from the Blitz. Southwark was bombed seven times and its population halved by the end of the War. At the start of the War the boys and girls from the Polytechnic's Trade Schools were evacuated to Exeter. From 1940 to 1941, the Polytechnic was bombed five times but continued to provide hundred of meals a day to the homeless of Southwark during this period. From 1945 to 1954, British painter David Bomberg taught art at the Polytechnic forming the 'Borough Group' of artists with his pupils. In 1956, the Polytechnic was designated a Regional College of Technology and Dr J. E. Garside was installed as the new Principal until 1965, when Mr Vivian Pereira-Mendoza took over. Further extensions to the buildings were made during the 1960s with the opening of the National College Wing in 1961 and the extension buildings and Tower Block in 1969, which were officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In 1970, the Brixton School of Building (founded in 1904), the City of Westminster College (founded in 1918 – and not the same institution as the current City of Westminster College) and the National College of Heating, Ventilating, Refrigeration and Fan Engineering (founded in 1947) merged with the Polytechnic to become the Polytechnic of the South Bank. The new institution adopted a coat of arms designed to include two Thames barges set above a pentagon surrounded by five other pentagons. An official designation service took place the following year, at which Margaret Thatcher was the guest speaker. In 1972 the purpose-built Wandsworth Road site opened, providing space for the Polytechnic's Faculty of the Built Environment, which at the time was the biggest and most comprehensive faculty in Europe for teaching built environment subjects such as surveying, town planning, architecture and other property related professional disciplines. In 1975, the extensive London Road building was opened, providing space for expanding business courses and the library. In 1976, part of Rachel MacMillan College of Education merged with the Polytechnic along with the Battersea College of Education bringing with them sites at Manresa House, Roehampton and Manor House, Clapham Common. In 1974, political conflict broke out between left-wing academics and the right-wing administration of the Polytechnic of the South Bank, and this led to many accusations thrown backwards and forwards and blame as to who was responsible. The political conflict became a focus of the institution's activities, and in 1980 after Margaret Thatcher's right-wing Conservative party was elected to government, ILEA (the Inner London Education authority, which was responsible for the London Polytechnics) called on Open University Professor Beishon of the Open Systems Unit to become the caretaker Director. There were sackings of staff and one HoD in particular sued Prof Beishon and Polytechnic of the South Bank (see South Bank's own news sheets from 1984-1987). On the day of the legal action (4Dec1984), the ex-HoD settled out of Court for a 4 figure sum (Evening News\Daily Mail), and the academic staff were given the opportunity to select their own Heads of department and Dean in the troublesome London Road based Faculty. In 1985, South Bank Technopark opened on London Road and in 1987 the Polytechnic changed its name again to become South Bank Polytechnic. In the same year, the British Youth Opera (BYO) was founded and made a home at the Polytechnic's Southwark campus. Prof John Beishon maintained the stability at PoSB now called South Bank Polytechnic on their letter heads, and was seconded to settle the political dispute that then bubbled up at North London Polytechnic (1984–85) between an extreme right-wing student and the left-wing academics and NUS. Prof Beishon's time was then split between South Bank Polytechnic which ran without problems and his conflict resolution of the troubles at North London Polytechnic for which he found a good solution. The troubles that erupted at both the Polytechnic of the South Bank and later at North London Polytechnic were symptomatic of attempts to undermine the educational establishment under the Labour Government, and can be seen as instigated by right-wing agent provocateurs. In 1987, Mrs Pauline Perry, Baroness Perry of Southwark was appointed Director, who oversaw the conversion of the Polytechnic into a flagship university. In 1990, the Polytechnic was accredited for Research Degrees and in 1991 the Central Catering College at Waterloo and South West London College merged with it. In 1992, the newly created Baroness Perry (August1991) became the University's first Vice-Chancellor. In 1992, the Polytechnic was granted university status and accordingly changed its name to South Bank University. That year also saw the new university celebrate its centenary and adopt the marketing slogan, ""the University without Ivory Towers"". In 1993, Prof Gerald Bernbaum was appointed Vice-Chancellor and the Centenary Library was renamed the Perry Library. Redwood College of Health Studies and Great Ormond Street School of Nursing merged with the University in 1995 leading to the establishment of two satellite campuses teaching Health at Havering and Whipps Cross (which closed in 2011). 2000 to present. In 2001, Prof Deian Hopkin became Vice-Chancellor and the Wandsworth Road site was sold. On 1 September 2003, the University underwent its most recent name change to become London South Bank University (LSBU) and in that year officially opened the Keyworth Centre, a modern teaching facility. Professor Martin Earwicker was appointed Vice-Chancellor in 2009, the year in which another major building on their Southwark campus, the Grimshaw-designed K2, was opened to house the Faculty of Health & Social Care and the Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB). Campus. The main campus populates a triangular section of roads in the Borough of Southwark, immediately north of the Elephant and Castle. London's South Bank is a walk or bus-ride away at Waterloo. To the north of the campus is Borough Road, where the main entrance is situated and the original building of the Borough Polytechnic Institute. To the west is London Road and to the east is Southwark Bridge Road. At the northwest corner is St George's Circus. Schiller International University had a campus in the Technopark Building on the London South Bank University property. In August 2011 Schiller stated that it was closing its London campus and will not start the Autumn 2011 semester there, due to stricter student visa requirements in the United Kingdom. There is a smaller satellite campus in east London: at Havering (LSBU at Havering), diagonally opposite the Harold Wood railway station. Organisation and academic life. The university has four faculties covering Health & Social Care; Business; Arts & Human Sciences and Engineering, Science & the Built Environment. At the end of 2009 it opened K2, a new sustainable teaching building which houses the training and demonstrating Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB). The building also houses skills laboratories for the University's nursing studients. Further campus developments include a new Student Centre, due to open late 2012, followed by an Enterprise Centre in 2013. The British painter David Bomberg taught Art at the Borough Polytechnic between 1945 and 1954. One of the university's halls of residence, David Bomberg House, carries his name and a handful of his works are on display at the University. Major paintings by Bomberg were acquired by the Tate Gallery after his death. LSBU is a major centre for Knowledge Transfer between the university and business and industry. Today, the university is a leading Knowledge Base partner, collaborating with over 100 companies from a variety of sectors and industries. The University is engaged in a 15-year development programme investing nearly £50m to enhance its campuses and to provide facilities for its students and employees. The University's main campus is close to many of London's major landmarks and tourist attractions on the South Bank and in easy reach of overground trains, the London Underground and many bus routes. LSBU works in partnership with many institutions in the UK, Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia. It currently works closely with a number of Chinese Higher Education Institutions, including Beijing Institute of Technology, Hunan University, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Northwestern Polytechnical University, National Academy of Education Administration etc. The collaborative educational programmes both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels have been running for over ten years with the Chinese partners. LSBU is the first university sponsored by the Office of Chinese Language Council International (Hanban) to establish a Confucius Institute for Traditional Chinese Medicine in London. Students. A third of LSBU's students are from the London Borough of Southwark, with almost two thirds coming from Greater London and the UK and around 12% of students from the EU and overseas, which equate to over 3,000 EU and other international students, from more than 130 different countries. 56% of the student population are from ethnic minorities and over 80% of the students are classified as mature (21 or over when they start their course). Degree days. Graduates from the Faculty of Health and Social Care are celebrated at a day in May at the Royal Festival Hall. The remaining graduates from the other three faculties meet in October at Royal Festival Hall for graduation ceremonies organised across a week. Rankings and reputation. The 2010 DLHE survey of destination of leavers in higher education concluded that London South Bank University has improved in many important areas. These include: LSBU's ‘employment indicator’ for full-time undergraduate students has improved from 74.4% to 82.4%. Overall unemployment has fallen from 12.9% to 9.8%. All other measures except for ‘part-time other undergraduate’ (HND, HNC, Foundation Degree etc.) have also improved. London South Bank University has ranked as 6th in the UK for graduate starting salaries. The Guardian's league table of teaching excellence ranks the University 114th out of 118 British institutions. It also rates LSBU in the top 20 per cent of universities for added value. The Sunday Times' league table, measuring a number of different factors including teaching quality, research quality and employment rates, ranks the University 115th out of 122. "
wikipedia-386189," Westfield Group  The Westfield Group is an Australian shopping centre group undertaking ownership, development, design, construction, funds/asset management, property management, leasing, and marketing activities. The multinational company is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and has interests in and operates one of the world's largest shopping centre portfolios with investment interests in 103 shopping centres across Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Brazil, encompassing around 23,000 retail outlets and total assets under management in excess of A$63 billion. In 2010, the Westfield Group split 50% of its Australian and New Zealand assets into the Westfield Retail Trust, trading on the Australian Stock Exchange as . History. The Westfield Group had origins in the western suburbs of Sydney. The first development was named ""Westfield Place"", and opened in July 1959 in Blacktown. The name Westfield is derived from ""west"" related to the West-Sydney location, and ""field"" due to having located on subdivided farmland. The centre was opened by John Saunders and Frank Lowy. The company was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1960 and built another five centres in New South Wales before expanding into Victoria and Queensland in 1966-67. The expansion into the United States began with the purchase of the Trumbull Shopping Park in Connecticut in 1977, and was followed by three centres in California, Michigan and Connecticut in 1980 and three centres in California, New Jersey and Long Island, New York in 1986. In 1994 Westfield joined together with General Growth and Whitehall Real Estate to purchase 19 centres for US$1 billion. Westfield seems to form clusters of centres around particular cities or within a small number of states. They built considerable holdings on the east coast and in California before expanding in the Mid-West. By 2005, the company owned centres in 15 US states. In the 1990s, Westfield began a major expansion to New Zealand, where they mostly bought existing shopping centres of the Fletchers company, progressively rebranding them. Only in 2007, with Westfield Albany, has the company opened a fully new centre in the country. In April 2012 it was announced that the Westfield Group will sell seven 'non-core' property assets to Starwood Capital Group for A$1 billion and one other property to an undisclosed buyer for A$147 million. The funds will be used to repay debt and invest in businesses offering higher return. The sales are expected to be completed by mid–2012. Current operations. Westfield currently has interests in total assets worth A$58 billion, owning 119 shopping malls in four countries - Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States - with over 10 million square metres of retail space. It is the world's largest retail property group by equity market capitalization. Despite the Westfield Group's asset dimensions, the Westfield Group is strongly controlled by the Lowy Family Group, including non-executive chairman, Frank Lowy, one of its founders. Lowy's two younger sons, Steven and Peter, are joint managing directors. Australia. Having been established in Australia, with their original premises being at Blacktown, the Westfield Group continue to operate a large number of shopping centres in Australia. The largest Westfield shopping centres in Australia include: United States. Since entering the United States market in 1977, Westfield has aggressively acquired, renovated and expanded many mall properties in order to draw wealthier consumers from longer distances. In May 2001, Westfield paid US$127 million for a 99-year lease on the retail area beneath the New York World Trade Center. In September 2003 the Westfield Group received US$17.3 million as a party in the insurance claim following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On 18 February 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that Westfield, ""the largest owner of shopping centres in California and the world"", had agreed to acquire 15 stores from Federated Department Stores, all but three in southern California. Westfield has also financed large advertising campaigns to increase awareness of its Westfield brand. On 9 May 2006, Westfield announced the sale of 8 centres in the United States, in an effort to divest themselves of ""non-strategic assets since they no longer fit within our investment criteria nor are they in our long-term redevelopment plans"". Since then, the company disposed 5 centers, including four out of the remaining five ""Westfield Missouri"" malls, and the high end ""Shops at 'Westfield' North Bridge."" New Zealand. Westfield Malls are by far the most numerous chain in New Zealand, with 6 of its 11 centres in Auckland including their largest development located in Albany. In mid-2012 Westfield sold its 50% share of Westfield Shore City in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore, now known as Shore City Shopping Centre. The group reportedly also has three of its smaller malls; Pakuranga, Glenfield, and Chartwell in Hamilton up for sale. United Kingdom. Westfield has an interest in ten shopping centres in England and Northern Ireland.  By far its most significant asset is Westfield's 50% partnership in the £1.6b Westfield London development in Shepherd's Bush, west London. The development included the construction of a new railway station for the London Overground and Southern services, and a new entrance for the London Underground station. Westfield owns the Westfield Stratford City and also controls the Stratford City redevelopment project next to 2012 Olympic park in Stratford in east London, having acquired the 75% of the project that it did not already own. Westfield is the developer behind the troubled Broadway shopping development in Bradford after acquiring Stannifer in 2004. On 9 October 2007 Westfield opened the £340m extension and refurbishment of Derby's Eagle Centre, which saw the shopping centre rebranded ""Westfield Derby"". Westfield are currently reviewing plans with the Whitgift Foundation to rebuild the Whitgift Centre in Croydon in south London. Relationship with tenants. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has investigated several disputes between the Westfield Group and its tenants. In 2004 the Commission found Westfield was abusing its market and commercial power in settling disputes with tenants, and forced Westfield to formally undertake to not engage in ""Unconscionable conduct and intimidation"" of tenants. Also in Australia, Westfield fee structures and policies have also been criticised by retailers who operate in centres which have been taken over by the multinational company. Retailers have suggested that when centres are acquired there should be more cooperation between the new operators and existing tenants in bringing shops up to the corporate standards of The Westfield Group, and increases in rent (required to operate a shopping centre with high standards of fittings and services) should be staged with the required improvements in fittings. Relationship with competition. In 2002, a competing shopping centre was lodged to Liverpool Council and subsequently built. The centre would be about 3 kilometres from Westfield Liverpool. In 2003 when the second stage was built, the Westfield Group allegedly sought help from the government in forcing its closure. References.

wikipedia-386193," Nördlingen  Nördlingen is a town in the Donau-Ries district, in Bavaria, Germany, with a population of approximately 24,000. It was first mentioned in recorded history in 898 and in 1998 the town celebrated its 1100th Anniversary. The town was also the location of two battles during the Thirty Years' War, a war which took place between 1618-1648. Today it is one of only three towns in Germany that still has a completely established city wall, the other two being Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Dinkelsbühl. Another attraction in the town is the Saint Georg's Church's 90 m steeple, called ""Daniel"", which is made of a suevite impact breccia that contains shocked quartz. Other notable buildings are the town hall (which dates to the 13th century), St. Salvator church and the ""Spital"", a former medieval hospital. The Ries crater museum is located in the well-preserved medieval tanner's quarter. The city is home to several other museums, such as the Bavarian Railway Museum, the Nördlingen city museum (""Stadtmuseum""), the city wall museum (""Stadtmauermuseum"") and ""Augenblick"" museum with panoramas, magic lanterns, silent films, barrel organs, pianolas, music boxes and gramophones. Nördlingen is also known for the ""Scharlachrennen"", a horse riding tournament that was first mentioned in 1463. History. The remains of a Roman castellum, built in the year 85 and probably called Septemiacum, have been found under the city. In 1998, Nördlingen celebrated its 1100-year-old history. Until the Thirty Years' War and the Battle of Nördlingen (1634), Nördlingen was one of Germany's major trading towns. The Nördlingen trade fair (""Pfingstmesse"") was first mentioned in 1219. A second battle was also fought there during the Thirty Years' War. Nördlingen was one of the first Protestant cities and took part in the Protestation at Speyer in 1529. In 1604 a shortened and simplified version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was performed in Nördlingen - this was one of the first performances of any Shakespearean play outside England. In 1215 Emperor Frederick II declared Nordlingen a Free Imperial City,and it remained so until 1802 when it changed to become part of present-day Bavaria. Economy. Important companies in Nördlingen are: Nördlingen has a station on the Ries Railway, which is served hourly on weekdays. Sport. The local sports club, the TSV 1861 Nördlingen, has a very successful basketball department with the men's and the women's team both in the Basketball Bundesliga. The clubs football team is traditionally the strongest side in northern Swabia. Its most successful former player is Gerd Müller, who was born and raised in Nördlingen. Its stadium was renamed in his honour in 2008. Popular culture. The fairytale-ballet anime ""Princess Tutu"" is set in the fictional Kinkan Town, which is heavily based on Nördlingen. Nördlingen was the town shown in ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" in 1971, when in the final scenes the glass elevator is floating over a town. Impact Diamonds. Stone buildings in the town contain millions of tiny diamonds, all less than 0.2 millimeters across. The impact that caused the Nördlinger Ries crater created an estimated 72000 tons of them when it impacted a local graphite deposit. Stone from this area was later quarried and used to build the stone buildings. "
wikipedia-386195," FIFA World Player of the Year  The FIFA World Player of the Year is an football award presented to the player voted as best in the world by coaches and captains of international teams. It began in 1991 as an award for the best men's player in the world; a women's award was added in 2001. In a voting system based on positional voting, each coach has three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the winners are ordered based on total number of points.  During the time that the men's award was presented, European-based Brazilian players dominated that award, winning 8 out of 18 editions of the prize, ahead of the second country France, which won it three times. In terms of individual players who have received the award, Brazil leads with five, followed by Italy and Portugal with two each. The women's award has had fewer individual winners. So far, only five players – one from each of three different countries, plus two Americans – have won the award. Of these women, only 2011 winner Homare Sawa and 2012 winner Abby Wambach have won only one award. The award's youngest winner, male or female, was Ronaldo, who won at the age of 20 in 1996. He won it again in 1997 and 2002. Marta is the only player to win it five times in a row; Birgit Prinz won three times in a row, while Ronaldo, Mia Hamm and Ronaldinho won twice in a row. Marta is the only five-time winner, while Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, and Prinz have won the award three times. The oldest winner of either sex is Sawa, who was 33 when she won in 2011. The oldest male winner is Fabio Cannavaro, who was also 33 when he won in 2006, but whose birth date is one week after Sawa's. The youngest female winner is Marta, who won in 2006 at age 20, but was seven months older than Ronaldo in 1996. In 2010, the FIFA World Player of the Year and ""France Footballs Ballon d'Or award were merged and the world's best male player has since been awarded the FIFA Ballon d'Or each year. Nomination and selection process. Following criticism from some sections of the media over nominations in previous years, in 2004 FIFA drew up a short list of 35 men and 21 women from which national team managers and, for the first time, team captains and representatives from FIFPro (the worldwide representative organisation for professional players) could vote.

wikipedia-386209," Roberto Assagioli  Roberto Assagioli (Venice, February 27, 1888 – Capolona d'Arezzo, August 23, 1974) was an Italian psychiatrist and pioneer in the fields of humanistic and transpersonal psychology. Assagioli founded the psychological movement known as Psychosynthesis, which is still being developed today by therapists, and psychologists, who practice his technique. His work emphasized the possibility of progressive integration of the personality around its own essential Self through the use of the will. Assagioli's life. Assagioli did not like to discuss his personal life, as he preferred to be remembered for his scientific work. Very few biographical accounts on the life of Roberto Assagioli are available, and most are not written in English. Assagioli was born on February 27, 1888 in Venice, Italy, and came from a middle-class Jewish background. He was born under the name Roberto Marco Grego, however, his biological father died when Assagioli was two years old, and his mother remarried Alessandro Emanuele Assagioli soon afterward. Assagioli was exposed to many creative outlets at a young age, such as art, and music, which were believed to have inspired his work in Psychosynthesis. By the age of 18, he had learned eight different languages, namely Italian (his native tongue), English, French, Russian, Greek, Latin, German, and Sanskrit. It was at this age he also began to travel, mainly to Russia, where he learned about social systems, and politics. In 1922 he married a young woman named Nella, and they had one son together, Ilario Assagioli.  In 1938, Assagioli was arrested and imprisoned by Benito Mussolini’s Fascist government, due to his Jewish heritage, and his humanistic writing. He was placed in solitary confinement for over a month, until he was released and returned to his family. During World War II, his family’s farm in Florence, Italy was destroyed, and both he and his family fled underground. His son died at the age of 28 from lung disease, which was accredited to severe stress from the harsh living conditions during the war. Once the war had ended, he returned to his work, and began his legacy, known as Psychosynthesis. The years after the war were relatively calm, and it was during this time that he founded various foundations dedicated to Psychosynthesis, in Europe and North America. Assagioli lived a long and prosperous life, and had a happy forty year marriage, until he died at age 86 on August 23d, 1974. The cause of his death was unknown. Education. Assagioli received his first degree in neurology and psychiatry at Istituto di Studii Superiori Pratici e di Perfezionamento, in Florence in 1910. It was during this time he began writing articles that criticized psychoanalysis, in which Assagioli argued a more holistic approach.  Once he finished his studies in Italy, Assagioli went to Switzerland, where he was trained in psychiatry at the psychiatric hospital Burghölzli in Zürich. This led to him opening the first psychoanalytic practice in Italy, known as Instituto di Psicosintesi. However, his work in psychoanalysis left him unsatisfied with the field of psychiatry, as a whole, as he felt that psychoanalysis was incomplete. Psychosynthesis. Inspiration and development. Assagioli is famous for developing and founding the science of Psychosynthesis, a spiritual and holistic approach to psychology that had developed from psychoanalysis. He was largely inspired by Freud’s idea of the repressed mind and Jung’s theories of the collective unconscious. Trained in psychoanalysis but unsatisfied by what he regarded as its incompleteness as a whole, Assagioli felt that love, wisdom, creativity, and will, were all important components that should be included in psychoanalysis. Assagioli’s earliest development of Psychosynthesis started in 1911, when he began his formal education in psychology. He continued his work on Psychosynthesis right up until his death.Freud and Assagioli were known to have corresponded, although they never had the chance to meet. Assagioli said, ""Psychosynthesis presupposes psychoanalysis, or rather, includes it as a first and necessary stage.""  However, Assagioli disagreed with theories formulated by Sigmund Freud that he considered limiting. He refused to accept Freud's reductionism and neglect of the positive dimensions of the personality. Psychosynthesis became the first approach, born of psychoanalysis that also included the artistic, altruistic and heroic potentials of the human being.Assagioli's work was more in alignment with psychologist, Carl Jung. Both Assagioli and Jung validated the importance of the spiritual level of human existence. Assagioli shared with Jung the insight that psychological symptoms can be triggered by spiritual dynamics. Assagioli considered Jung’s theories to be closest to his understanding of Psychosynthesis.  Assagioli accredited much of his inspiration for Psychosynthesis to his month-long incarceration in solitary confinement in 1938. He used his time in prison to exercise his mental will, by meditating daily while in prison. He concluded that he was able to change his punishment into an opportunity to investigate his inner-Self. ""Psychology Today"" interview. In the December 1974 issue of ""Psychology Today"", Assagioli was interviewed by Sam Keen, in which Assagioli discussed the differences between Freudian psychoanalysis and Psychosynthesis:  We pay far more attention to the higher unconscious and to the development of the transpersonal self. In one of his letters Freud said, ""I am interested only in the basement of the human being."" Psychosynthesis is interested in the whole building. We try to build an elevator which will allow a person access to every level of his personality. After all, a building with only a basement is very limited. We want to open up the terrace where you can sun-bathe or look at the stars. Our concern is the synthesis of all areas of the personality. That means Psychosynthesis is holistic, global and inclusive. It is not against psychoanalysis or even behavior modification but it insists that the needs for meaning, for higher values, for a spiritual life, are as real as biological or social needs. We deny that there are any isolated human problems. Assagioli noted that Carl Jung, ""of all modern psychotherapists, is the closest in theory and practice to psychosynthesis"", and further expanded on the similarities between his own and Jung's views: In the practice of therapy we both agree in rejecting ‘pathologism’ that is, concentration upon morbid manifestations and symptoms of a supposed psychological ‘disease’. We regard man as a fundamentally, healthy organism in which there may be temporary malfunctioning. Nature is always trying to re-establish harmony, and within the psyche the principle of synthesis is dominant. Irreconcilable opposites do not exist. The task of therapy is to aid the individual in transforming the personality, and integrating apparent contradictions. Both Jung and myself have stressed the need for a person to develop the higher psychic functions, the spiritual dimension. He also highlighted the differences between Jung's work and Psychosynthesis: Perhaps the best way to state our differences is with a diagram of the psychic functions. Jung differentiates four functions: sensation, feeling, thought, and intuition. Psychosynthesis says that Jung’s four functions do not provide for a complete description of the psychological life. Our view can be visualized like this: We hold that outside imagination or fantasy is a distinct function. There is also a group of functions that impels us toward action in the outside world. This group includes instincts, tendencies, impulses, desires, and aspirations. And here we come to one of the central foundations of Psychosynthesis: There is a fundamental difference between drives, impulses, desires, and the will. In the human condition there are frequent conflicts between desire and will. And we will place the will in a central position at the heart of self-consciousness or the Ego.  Assagioli asserted about the will: The will is not merely assertive, aggressive, and controlling. There is the accepting will, yielding will, the dedicated will. You might say that there is a feminine polarity to the will – the willing surrender, the joyful acceptance of the other functions of the personality. At the end of the interview, Keen himself concluded: It is hard to know what counts as evidence for the validity of a world view and the therapeutic it entails. Every form of therapy has dramatic successes and just as dramatic failures. Enter as evidence in the case for Psychosynthesis an ad hominem argument: in speaking about death there was no change in the tone or intensity of Assagioli’s voice and the light still played in his dark eyes, and his mouth was never very far from a smile. Continued impact. Since Assagioli’s death in the early 1970s, Psychosynthesis has continued to be embraced as a comprehensive psychological approach for finding inner peace and harmony.  The Psychosynthesis & Education Trust center in Britain was founded by Assagioli in 1965, and is currently being run by President Lady Diana Whitmore. The Trust is affiliated with Humanistic and Integrative Psychology Section of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP), and a is founding member of the European Federation of Psychosynthesis Psychotherapy (EFPP). At present time, the group consists of a large group of Psychosynthesis practitioners who mediate students. The Trust offers workshops, courses, and a newsletter, to anyone who is interested in learning more about Psychosynthesis.  The Association for the Advancement of Psychosynthesis (AAP) was formed in August 1995, as a non-profit organization in the United States, with approximately two-hundred members across the country. Members of the AAP run programs, workshops, and conferences, to discuss Assagioli and Psychosynthesis, and publish a newsletter to discuss new topics related to the field.  The Will Project Wiki was created in 2007, and was based on the Will Project proposed by Assagioli when he was alive. The Will Project consists of over 63 articles based on Assagioli’s published book The Act of Will. "
wikipedia-386214," Wallpaper group  A wallpaper group (or plane symmetry group or plane crystallographic group) is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct groups. Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional symmetry groups, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze groups and the three-dimensional crystallographic groups (also called space groups). Introduction. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns that are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group. Consider the following examples: Examples A and B have the same wallpaper group; it is called p4m in the IUC notation and *442 in the orbifold notation. Example C has a different wallpaper group, called p4g or 4*2 . The fact that A and B have the same wallpaper group means that they have the same symmetries, regardless of details of the designs, whereas C has a different set of symmetries despite any superficial similarities. A complete list of all seventeen possible wallpaper groups can be found below. Symmetries of patterns. A symmetry of a pattern is, loosely speaking, a way of transforming the pattern so that the pattern looks exactly the same after the transformation. For example, translational symmetry is present when the pattern can be translated (shifted) some finite distance and appear unchanged. Think of shifting a set of vertical stripes horizontally by one stripe. The pattern is unchanged. Strictly speaking, a true symmetry only exists in patterns that repeat exactly and continue indefinitely. A set of only, say, five stripes does not have translational symmetry — when shifted, the stripe on one end ""disappears"" and a new stripe is ""added"" at the other end. In practice, however, classification is applied to finite patterns, and small imperfections may be ignored. Sometimes two categorizations are meaningful, one based on shapes alone and one also including colors. When colors are ignored there may be more symmetry. In black and white there are also 17 wallpaper groups; e.g., a colored tiling is equivalent with one in black and white with the colors coded radially in a circularly symmetric ""bar code"" in the centre of mass of each tile. The types of transformations that are relevant here are called Euclidean plane isometries. For example: However, example C is ""different"". It only has reflections in horizontal and vertical directions, ""not"" across diagonal axes. If we flip across a diagonal line, we do ""not"" get the same pattern back; what we ""do"" get is the original pattern shifted across by a certain distance. This is part of the reason that the wallpaper group of A and B is different from the wallpaper group of C. History. A proof that there were only 17 possible patterns was first carried out by Evgraf Fedorov in 1891 and then derived independently by George Pólya in 1924. Formal definition and discussion. Mathematically, a wallpaper group or plane crystallographic group is a type of topologically discrete group of isometries of the Euclidean plane that contains two linearly independent translations. Two such isometry groups are of the same type (of the same wallpaper group) if they are the same up to an affine transformation of the plane. Thus e.g. a translation of the plane (hence a translation of the mirrors and centres of rotation) does not affect the wallpaper group. The same applies for a change of angle between translation vectors, provided that it does not add or remove any symmetry (this is only the case if there are no mirrors and no glide reflections, and rotational symmetry is at most of order 2). Unlike in the three-dimensional case, we can equivalently restrict the affine transformations to those that preserve orientation. It follows from the Bieberbach theorem that all wallpaper groups are different even as abstract groups (as opposed to e.g. Frieze groups, of which two are isomorphic with Z). 2D patterns with double translational symmetry can be categorized according to their symmetry group type. Isometries of the Euclidean plane. Isometries of the Euclidean plane fall into four categories (see the article Euclidean plane isometry for more information). The independent translations condition. The condition on linearly independent translations means that there exist linearly independent vectors ""v"" and ""w"" (in R2) such that the group contains both ""T""""v"" and ""T""""w"". The purpose of this condition is to distinguish wallpaper groups from frieze groups, which possess a translation but not two linearly independent ones, and from two-dimensional discrete point groups, which have no translations at all. In other words, wallpaper groups represent patterns that repeat themselves in ""two"" distinct directions, in contrast to frieze groups, which only repeat along a single axis. The discreteness condition. The discreteness condition means that there is some positive real number ε, such that for every translation ""T""""v"" in the group, the vector ""v"" has length ""at least"" ε (except of course in the case that ""v"" is the zero vector). The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the group has a compact fundamental domain, or in other words, a ""cell"" of nonzero, finite area, which is repeated through the plane. Without this condition, we might have for example a group containing the translation ""T""""x"" for every rational number ""x"", which would not correspond to any reasonable wallpaper pattern. One important and nontrivial consequence of the discreteness condition in combination with the independent translations condition is that the group can only contain rotations of order 2, 3, 4, or 6; that is, every rotation in the group must be a rotation by 180°, 120°, 90°, or 60°. This fact is known as the crystallographic restriction theorem, and can be generalised to higher-dimensional cases. Notations for wallpaper groups. Crystallographic notation. Crystallography has 230 space groups to distinguish, far more than the 17 wallpaper groups, but many of the symmetries in the groups are the same. Thus we can use a similar notation for both kinds of groups, that of Carl Hermann and Charles-Victor Mauguin. An example of a full wallpaper name in Hermann-Mauguin style (also called IUC notation) is p31m, with four letters or digits; more usual is a shortened name like cmm or pg. For wallpaper groups the full notation begins with either p or c, for a ""primitive cell"" or a ""face-centred cell""; these are explained below. This is followed by a digit, n, indicating the highest order of rotational symmetry: 1-fold (none), 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold. The next two symbols indicate symmetries relative to one translation axis of the pattern, referred to as the ""main"" one; if there is a mirror perpendicular to a translation axis we choose that axis as the main one (or if there are two, one of them). The symbols are either m, g, or 1, for mirror, glide reflection, or none. The axis of the mirror or glide reflection is perpendicular to the main axis for the first letter, and either parallel or tilted 180°/""n"" (when ""n"" > 2) for the second letter. Many groups include other symmetries implied by the given ones. The short notation drops digits or an m that can be deduced, so long as that leaves no confusion with another group. A primitive cell is a minimal region repeated by lattice translations. All but two wallpaper symmetry groups are described with respect to primitive cell axes, a coordinate basis using the translation vectors of the lattice. In the remaining two cases symmetry description is with respect to centred cells that are larger than the primitive cell, and hence have internal repetition; the directions of their sides is different from those of the translation vectors spanning a primitive cell. Hermann-Mauguin notation for crystal space groups uses additional cell types. Here are all the names that differ in short and full notation. The remaining names are p1, p3, p3m1, p31m, p4, and p6. Orbifold notation. Orbifold notation for wallpaper groups, introduced by John Horton Conway (Conway, 1992) (Conway 2008), is based not on crystallography, but on topology. We fold the infinite periodic tiling of the plane into its essence, an orbifold, then describe that with a few symbols. Consider the group denoted in crystallographic notation by cmm; in Conway's notation, this will be 2*22. The 2 before the * says we have a 2-fold rotation centre with no mirror through it. The * itself says we have a mirror. The first 2 after the * says we have a 2-fold rotation centre on a mirror. The final 2 says we have an independent second 2-fold rotation centre on a mirror, one that is not a duplicate of the first one under symmetries. The group denoted by pgg will be 22x. We have two pure 2-fold rotation centres, and a glide reflection axis. Contrast this with pmg, Conway 22*, where crystallographic notation mentions a glide, but one that is implicit in the other symmetries of the orbifold. Coxeter's bracket notation is also included, based on reflectional Coxeter groups, and modified with plus superscripts accounting for rotations, improper rotations and translations. Why there are exactly seventeen groups. An orbifold can be viewed as a polygon with face, edges, and vertices, which can be unfolded to form a possibly infinite set of polygons which tile either the sphere, the plane or the hyperbolic plane. When it tiles the plane it will give a wallpaper group and when it tiles the sphere or hyperbolic plane it gives either a spherical symmetry group or Hyperbolic symmetry group. The type of space the polygons tile can be found by calculating the Euler characteristic, ""χ"" = ""V"" − ""E"" + ""F"", where ""V"" is the number of corners (vertices), ""E"" is the number of edges and ""F"" is the number of faces. If the Euler characteristic is positive then the orbifold has an elliptic (spherical) structure; if it is zero then it has a parabolic structure, i.e. a wallpaper group; and if it is negative it will have a hyperbolic structure. When the full set of possible orbifolds is enumerated it is found that only 17 have Euler characteristic 0. When an orbifold replicates by symmetry to fill the plane, its features create a structure of vertices, edges, and polygon faces, which must be consistent with the Euler characteristic. Reversing the process, we can assign numbers to the features of the orbifold, but fractions, rather than whole numbers. Because the orbifold itself is a quotient of the full surface by the symmetry group, the orbifold Euler characteristic is a quotient of the surface Euler characteristic by the order of the symmetry group. The orbifold Euler characteristic is 2 minus the sum of the feature values, assigned as follows: For a wallpaper group, the sum for the characteristic must be zero; thus the feature sum must be 2. Now enumeration of all wallpaper groups becomes a matter of arithmetic, of listing all feature strings with values summing to 2. Feature strings with other sums are not nonsense; they imply non-planar tilings, not discussed here. (When the orbifold Euler characteristic is negative, the tiling is hyperbolic; when positive, spherical or ""bad""). Guide to recognizing wallpaper groups. To work out which wallpaper group corresponds to a given design, one may use the following table. See also . The seventeen groups. Each of the groups in this section has two cell structure diagrams, which are to be interpreted as follows: On the right-hand side diagrams, different equivalence classes of symmetry elements are colored (and rotated) differently. The brown or yellow area indicates a fundamental domain, i.e. the smallest part of the pattern that is repeated. The diagrams on the right show the cell of the lattice corresponding to the smallest translations; those on the left sometimes show a larger area. Group p1. The two translations (cell sides) can each have different lengths, and can form any angle. Group pg. Without the details inside the zigzag bands the mat is pmg; with the details but without the distinction between brown and black it is pgg. Ignoring the wavy borders of the tiles, the pavement is pgg. Group cmm. The rotational symmetry of order 2 with centres of rotation at the centres of the sides of the rhombus is a consequence of the other properties. The pattern corresponds to each of the following: Group p4. A p4 pattern can be looked upon as a repetition in rows and columns of equal square tiles with 4-fold rotational symmetry. Also it can be looked upon as a checkerboard pattern of two such tiles, a factor formula_1 smaller and rotated 45°. Group p4m. This corresponds to a straightforward grid of rows and columns of equal squares with the four reflection axes. Also it corresponds to a checkerboard pattern of two of such squares. Examples displayed with the smallest translations horizontal and vertical (like in the diagram): Examples displayed with the smallest translations diagonal (like on a checkerboard): Group p4g. A p4g pattern can be looked upon as a checkerboard pattern of copies of a square tile with 4-fold rotational symmetry, and its mirror image. Alternatively it can be looked upon (by shifting half a tile) as a checkerboard pattern of copies of a horizontally and vertically symmetric tile and its 90° rotated version. Note that neither applies for a plain checkerboard pattern of black and white tiles, this is group p4m (with diagonal translation cells). Group p3. Imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three, but the two are not equal, not each other's mirror image, and not both symmetric (if the two are equal we have p6, if they are each other's mirror image we have p31m, if they are both symmetric we have p3m1; if two of the three apply then the third also, and we have p6m). For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with rotation centres as vertices, i.e. for any tessellation two shifts are possible. In terms of the image: the vertices can be the red, the blue or the green triangles. Equivalently, imagine a tessellation of the plane with regular hexagons, with sides equal to the smallest translation distance divided by √3. Then this wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all hexagons are equal (and in the same orientation) and have rotational symmetry of order three, while they have no mirror image symmetry (if they have rotational symmetry of order six we have p6, if they are symmetric with respect to the main diagonals we have p31m, if they are symmetric with respect to lines perpendicular to the sides we have p3m1; if two of the three apply then the third also, and we have p6m). For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with one third of the rotation centres as centres of the hexagons. In terms of the image: the centres of the hexagons can be the red, the blue or the green triangles. Group p3m1. Like for p3, imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three, and both are symmetric, but the two are not equal, and not each other's mirror image. For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with rotation centres as vertices. In terms of the image: the vertices can be the red, the dark blue or the green triangles. Group p31m. Like for p3 and p3m1, imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three and are each other's mirror image, but not symmetric themselves, and not equal. For a given image, only one such tessellation is possible. In terms of the image: the vertices can ""not"" be dark blue triangles. Group p6. A pattern with this symmetry can be looked upon as a tessellation of the plane with equal triangular tiles with C3 symmetry, or equivalently, a tessellation of the plane with equal hexagonal tiles with C6 symmetry (with the edges of the tiles not necessarily part of the pattern). Group p6m. A pattern with this symmetry can be looked upon as a tessellation of the plane with equal triangular tiles with D3 symmetry, or equivalently, a tessellation of the plane with equal hexagonal tiles with D6 symmetry (with the edges of the tiles not necessarily part of the pattern). Thus the simplest examples are a triangular lattice with or without connecting lines, and a hexagonal tiling with one color for outlining the hexagons and one for the background. Lattice types. There are five lattice types or Bravais lattices, corresponding to the five possible wallpaper groups of the lattice itself. The wallpaper group of a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. Symmetry groups. The actual symmetry group should be distinguished from the wallpaper group. Wallpaper groups are collections of symmetry groups. There are 17 of these collections, but for each collection there are infinitely many symmetry groups, in the sense of actual groups of isometries. These depend, apart from the wallpaper group, on a number of parameters for the translation vectors, the orientation and position of the reflection axes and rotation centers. The numbers of degrees of freedom are: However, within each wallpaper group, all symmetry groups are algebraically isomorphic. Some symmetry group isomorphisms: Dependence of wallpaper groups on transformations. Note that when a transformation decreases symmetry, a transformation of the same kind (the inverse) obviously for some patterns increases the symmetry. Such a special property of a pattern (e.g. expansion in one direction produces a pattern with 4-fold symmetry) is not counted as a form of extra symmetry. Change of colors does not affect the wallpaper group if any two points that have the same color before the change, also have the same color after the change, and any two points that have different colors before the change, also have different colors after the change. If the former applies, but not the latter, such as when converting a color image to one in black and white, then symmetries are preserved, but they may increase, so that the wallpaper group can change. Web demo and software. There exist several software graphic tools that will let you create 2D patterns using wallpaper symmetry groups. Usually, you can edit the original tile and its copies in the entire pattern are updated automatically. "
wikipedia-386218," Mesolimbic pathway  The mesolimbic pathway is a dopaminergic pathway in the brain. The pathway begins in the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain and connects to the limbic system via the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the hippocampus as well as to the medial prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic dopamine system is widely believed to be a ""reward"" pathway, but that hypothesis is not universally accepted.  Anatomy. The following structures are considered to be a part of the mesolimbic pathway: Controversy over mesolimbic dopamine function. There is some controversy regarding dopamine’s role in the reward system. Three hypotheses—hedonia, learning, and incentive salience—have been proposed as explanations for dopamine’s function in the reward system. The hedonia hypothesis suggests that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens acts as a 'pleasure neurotransmitter'. In the late 1970s, it was found that some drugs of abuse involved dopamine activity, in particular in the nucleus accumbens, to cause the ""high"" or euphoric state. However, not all rewards or pleasurable things involve activation of the reward system, which may suggest that the mesolimbic pathway may not be just a system that works merely off enjoyable things (hedonia). Learning, on the other hand, deals with predictions of future rewards and association formation. Studies have shown that rats that had their ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens destroyed do not lose their learning capabilities, but rather lack the motivation to work for a reward. Incentive salience (wanting) stands out as a possible role for dopamine, as it regards this molecule as being released when there is a stimulus worth working hard for, thus making an individual work to get it. This is one of the reasons that dopamine transport has been extensively studied in ADD and ADHD. It is now widely understood that most people suffering from some form of attention deficit disorder most likely lack dopamine stimulation. This also explains why dopamine reuptake inhibitors and stimulants often dramatically improve symptoms of attention disorders. In self-administration studies, animals have been trained to give an operant response (lever press, nose poke, wheel turn, etc.) in order to obtain either a drug or a mate. It has been shown that the animals will continue to perform the required task until the reward is received, or fatigue sets in. Clinical significance. Since the mesolimbic pathway is shown to be associated with feelings of reward and desire, this pathway is heavily implicated in neurobiological theories of addiction, schizophrenia, and depression. Drug addiction, the loss of control over drug use or the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs despite adverse consequences, with the four major classes of abused drugs (psychostimulants, opiates, ethanol, and nicotine) are due to increased dopamine transmission in the limbic system-each by different mechanisms. Like drug addiction, schizophrenia and depression have similar structural changes with dopamine transmission. Other dopamine pathways. The other dopamine pathways are: "
wikipedia-386221," Pontiac Firebird  The Pontiac Firebird was built by the Pontiac division of General Motors between 1967 and 2002. The Firebird was introduced the same year as the automaker's platform-sharing model, the Chevrolet Camaro. This coincided with the release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, which shared its platform with another pony car, the Ford Mustang. The vehicles were powered by various four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and V8 engines sourced from several GM divisions. While primarily Pontiac-powered until 1977, Firebirds were built with several different engines from nearly every GM division until 1982 when GM began to discontinue engines it felt were unneeded and either spread successful designs from individual divisions among all divisions or use new engines of corporate architecture. First generation (1967–1969). The first generation Firebirds had a characteristic Coke bottle styling. Unlike its cousin, the Chevrolet Camaro, its bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end and its rear ""slit"" taillights were inspired by the Pontiac GTO. Both a two-door hardtop and a convertible were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally the car was a ""consolation prize"" for Pontiac, who had initially wished to produce a two-seat sports car of its own design, based on the original Banshee concept car. However, GM feared such a vehicle would directly compete with Chevrolet's Corvette, and the decision was made to give Pontiac a piece of the pony car market by having them share the F-body platform with Chevrolet. The base model Firebird came equipped with the OHC inline-6 and a single-barrel carburetor. The next model, the Sprint, had a four-barrel carburetor, developing 215 hp (160 kW). Most buyers opted for one of the V8 engines: the 326 CID (5.3 L) with a two-barrel carburetor producing 250 hp (186 kW); the ""H.O."" (High Output) engine of the same displacement, but with a four-barrel carburetor and producing 285 hp (213 kW); or the 400 CID (6.6 L) from the GTO with 325 hp (242 kW). A ""Ram Air"" option was also available in 1968, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a different camshaft. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400 H.O., but the engine peaked at a higher RPM. The 230 CID (3.8 L) engines were subsequently replaced by 250 CID (4.1 L) ones, the first developing 175 hp (130 kW) using a single-barrel carburetor, and the other 215 hp (160 kW) with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the 326 CID (5.3 L) engine was replaced by one with a displacement of 350 CID (5.7 L). An ""H.O."" version of the 350 CID with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year, developed . Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.  In 1969, a $725 optional handling package called the ""Trans Am Performance and Appearance Package,"", named after the Trans Am Series, which included a rear spoiler, was introduced. Of these first ""Trans Ams,"" only 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made. There was an additional Ram Air IV option for the 400 CID engine during that year, complementing the Ram Air III; these generated 345 and respectively. The 350 ""H.O."" engine was revised again with a different cam and cylinder heads resulting in . During 1969 a special engine was designed for SCCA road racing applications that was not available in production cars. The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of Federally mandated side marker lights: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door vent-windows were replaced with a single pane of glass. The 1969 model received a major facelift with a new front end design but unlike its big brother the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel. Due to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the all-new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models. Second generation (1970–1981). The second generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26, 1970, because of tooling and engineering problems; thus, its popular designation as a 1970½ model, while leftover 1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model-year identification. Trims Special versions Replacing the ""Coke bottle"" styling was a more ""swoopy"" body style, with the top of the rear window line going almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid—a look that was to epitomize F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird's lifetime. The new design was initially characterized with a large C-pillar, until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged. There were two Ram Air engines for 1970: the Ram Air III ( in GTO) and the Ram Air IV ( in GTO) that were carried over from 1969. The difference between the GTO and Firebird engines was the secondary carburetor linkage which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely. Bending the linkage to allow full carburetor operation resulted in identical engine performance. Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1973 model year due to the implementation of telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at in their first year of production (1973 model year). The 455 engine available in the second generation Firebird Trans Am was arguably the last high-performance engine of the original muscle car generation. The engine made its first appearance in the Firebird in 1971 as the 455-HO, which continued through the 1972 model year. In 1973 and 1974, a special version of the 455, called the Super Duty 455 (SD-455), was offered. The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included 4-bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged crankshaft, although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged aluminum pistons were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder heads. The 480737 code cam (identical grind to the RAIV ""041"" cam) was originally specified for the SD455 engine and was fitted into the ""pre-production"" test cars (source: former Pontiac Special Projects Engineer Skip McCully*), one of which was tested by both HOT ROD and CAR AND DRIVER magazines. However, actual production cars were fitted with the milder 493323 cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios, due to the ever-tightening emissions standards of the era. This cam and rocker combination, combined with a low compression ratio of 8.4:1 advertised (7.9:1 actual) yielded 290 SAE net horsepower. It should also be noted that production SD455 cars did not have functional hood scoops, while the ""pre-production"" test cars did.* Actual production cars yielded 1/4 mile results in the high 14 to 15.0 second/98 MPH range (sources: MOTOR TREND MAGAZINE, July '73 and Roger Huntington's book, AMERICAN SUPERCAR) – results that are consistent with a 3,850 pound car (plus driver) and the rated 290 SAE net horsepower figure. (An original rating of 310 SAE net horsepower had been assigned to the SD455, though that rating was based on the emissions non-compliant ""pre-production"" engines, as discussed above. That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature, which had been printed prior to the ""pre-production"" engines ""barely passing*"" emissions testing, and the last minute switch to what became the production engine. 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine (290 SAE net horsepower). A production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by HIGH PERFORMANCE PONTIAC magazine (January, 2007). This is also consistent with the 290 SAE Net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft). Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam.* When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine, Mr. McCully responded, ""Compression, camshaft, jetting, and vacuum advance."" He followed by stating that he would have preferred a compression ratio of 10.25:1, a camshaft with 041 valve timing, slightly richer carburetor jetting, and as much vacuum advance as the engine would tolerate.* (*May, 2005 issue of HIGH PERFORMANCE PONTIAC Magazine). Regrettably, that proved to be impossible due to the emissions regulations of the era. During a 1972 strike, the Firebird (and the sister F-body Camaro) were nearly dropped. Pontiac offered the 455 through the 1976 model year, but tightening restrictions on vehicle emissions guaranteed its demise. Thus, the 1976 Trans Am was the last of the ""Big Cube Birds,"" with only 7,100 units produced with the 455 engine. The 1974 models featured a redesigned ""shovel-nose"" front end and new wide ""slotted"" taillights. In 1974, Pontiac offered two base engines for the Firebird: a inline-6 and a V8. Available were to V8 engines, as well as the produced or , while the SD-455 produced . The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974 The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model. The Super Duty engine, Muncie 4-speed, and TurboHydramatic were no longer available in 1975. The 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models. In 1976, Pontiac celebrated their 50th Anniversary, and a special edition of the Trans Am was released. Painted in black with gold accents, this was the first anniversary Trans Am package and the first production Black and Gold special edition. In 1977, Pontiac offered the T/A 6.6 Litre 400 (RPO W72) rated at , as opposed to the regular 6.6 Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at . The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the Olds 403 engine, which offered a slightly higher compression ratio and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977. A distinctive, slant-nose facelift occurred in 1977, redone somewhat in 1979. From 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had previously been shared by both Second Generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in ""Smokey and the Bandit"". Later on the 1980 Turbo model was used for ""Smokey and the Bandit II"". Beginning in 1978, Pontiac engineers reversed years of declining power by raising the compression ratio in the Pontiac 400 through the installation of different cylinder heads with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 heads bolted to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads) (taken from the Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978–79 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400 CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine). 1979 marked the 10th Anniversary of the Trans Am, and a special anniversary package was made available: silver paint lower paint (with gray upper paint accents) with a silver leather interior. The 10th Anniversary cars also featured a special Firebird hood decal, which extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th Anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the Pontiac 400 engine (and coupled with the 4 speed Borg Warner Super T-10 transmission). The only option on these cars was the engine (the 400 was not certified for California, nor was cruise control available with it), which dictated the transmission and the gear ratio (3.23 on the 400 cars, 2.73 on the 403 cars). In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams which still holds the record to this day. Up until the 1979 models, the performance of 400-equipped Firebirds could still be brought up to pre-1970 levels by disabling emissions equipment- removing the catalytic converter and blocking off the exhaust gas recirculation system- and opening up the block off plate to make the hood scoop functional. However, in 1980, due to ever-increasing emissions restrictions, Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines. 1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The 301, offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. Options included a turbocharged 301 or the Chevrolet 305 small block. In the final year of the Second Generation Firebirds (1981), Trans Am still used the same engines as it had in the previous model year, with the only change being the addition of a new electronic carburetion system. American rapper Kesha has helped give the car a boost in popularity in recent years. Her own gold '78 Trans Am was used in the music video for her song Tik Tok, was mentioned in Take It Off and even had an entire song (entitled ""Gold Trans Am"") dedicated to it on her second album, ""Warrior"", Third generation (1982–1992). The availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the 3rd generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front wheel drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. The state of the art of computerized engine management was in its infancy, and as long as saving fuel was the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in the fuel consumption department, offering a 4-cylinder Firebird that would provide 34 miles per gallon. GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform, so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics. For the time being, they would have world class aerodynamics and handling, and excellent fuel economy. (Little did they know that by 1989 the fastest American car on the market would be a Firebird.) The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the 3rd Gen Firebird from its both its Camaro sibling and its prior form; (a styling characteristic carried into the 4th Gen's design). In addition to being about 500 lbs (227 kg) lighter than the previous 2nd Gen design, the 3rd Generation Firebird was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler. Styles.

Limited-interim availability as base engine in the Trans Am GTA; optional in Formula Firebird and regular Trans Am. Fourth generation (1993–2002). The fourth-generation F-body continued the aerodynamic formula initiated by the previous generation, but saw declining sales. As before, the Camaro kept the exposed headlights and the Firebird its pop-up units, with some minor changes. The overall styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the ""Banshee IV"" concept car than the 1991 ""face lift"" received by the Third Generation model. 1993. From 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a 3.4 L V6 with , or the 5.7 L LT1 V8. The 1993 Firehawk (only available in Formula trim for 1993–1997) received the SLP package with a functional hood scoop and other performance enhancements that increased power to . Only 201 were built for 1993. The LT1 engine in the Formula and Trans Am was very similar to the one in the Corvette C4 except with 2-bolt mains and a more restrictive intake/exhaust system. The 1993 model year V6 models had angular cable driven throttle body units that later changed in 1994 to multi-port fuel injection. 1994. The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another Anniversary Edition was released, painted white with a single blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It was also the debut of the 4L60e 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission in the F-body, which took the place of the non-electronic 700R4. Beginning in 1994, the engine used a ""MAF"" (mass air-flow) system in the air intake, rather than the ""speed density"" setup on the 1993 cars. 1994 was also the first year the 4th generation convertible was available. In 1994 only, a ""Trans Am GT"" option was available. Trans Am GT's received T-tops, high-rise spoiler, Z-rated tires, and a 155 mph spedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received a low-rise spoiler (the same found on v6/formula firebirds) as well as a 110 mph spedometer, no T-tops, and a much lower top-speed limiter. All of the 1994 Trans Am ""GT"" options became standard in 95-02 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some later (1995+) Trans Am and Formula Firebird will list ""GT"" on the vehicles title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a ""package"" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.) it only specifies the engine (5.7L V8 LT1). To cover all of the bases, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package. To decipher packages on a particular vehicle, RPO codes must be researched. 1995. The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: Acceleration Slip Regulation) was now available. The steering wheel was also changed. It was borrowed from the Grand Prix. 1995 was the first year of the vented version of the opti-spark distributor on F-body's. The optional Firehawk performance package, still available this year (since 1993), included suspension upgrades, a functional ram air hood, 17"" wheels with 275/40 tires, as well as a freer intake/exhaust similar to that on the Chevrolet Corvette, supplying 315 hp, but this package was seldom ordered. The 'Transmission Perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the connections are still there for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. 1996. The mid-1995 and later models had a 200 hp 3.8 L V6 as the base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 had been raised to 285 in 1996, due to a new dual catalytic converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first year of the OBD2 computer system. 1996 was the first year the WS6 Performance Package was made available on 4th generation (93-02) Firebirds. For 1996 (and 1997) The WS6 Package was available on both the Formula and Trans am. The WS6 package included a larger 32mm front swaybar (base V8's being 30mm), a functional ram-air hood (similar to that of the 93-97 Firehawk, but with slightly different styling in the hood, and smaller air filter than the Firehawk), 17""x9"" Wheels with 275/40 tires, and a WS6 Badge. Optional Bilstein Shocks were available, but not standard on the WS6 package. 1997. While there were no major changes to the '97 models from the previous year, a special edition LT4 Firehawk was available this year. With only 29 produced, the LT4 Firehawk used the same 330 hp, balanced and blue-printed LT4 engine found in the manual transmission 1996 Corvette. The 1997 Firehawk LT4 model, made by SLP Performance Parts and sold through Pontiac dealerships, had 330 hp (243 kW) and 340 lb·ft (459 Nm) of torque. The Ram Air (WS6) high performance package was added as an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles for the first time this year, boosting the horsepower from 285 to 305. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced in 1997 with the WS6 high performance package. 1998. In 1998, the Firebird received a ""face lift"" dominated by a new front fascia (now with four pop-up headlights) as well as other modifications, the most significant of which was the introduction of the latest Corvette small block V8 engine, the LS1. Initially, the color ""Bright Purple Metallic"" had been available, however it was discontinued due to poor sales. The color was replaced with ""Navy Blue Metallic,"" but not before a total of 12 Trans Am models with the WS6 Ram Air package (10 coupés and two convertibles) made it out of the factory dressed in ""Bright Purple Metal"". However in 1998 only 255 Formula Firebirds with the WS6 package were made and sold making them highly sought after now by true collectors. 1999. The Big 3-0 A new 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Trans Am added a little distinction to the 1999 Firebird offerings. Otherwise, there were only minor changes. Formulas and Trans Ams now had a four-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment. Buyers could choose from it or a six-speed manual, which had a Hurst shifter. Traction control was available on V-6 Firebirds. Specific V-6 Firebirds also got a Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle as standard equipment. An Electronic Brake Force Distribution system and solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock brake system enhanced stopping capabilities. Also new was an upgraded sensing and diagnostic module to improve the passenger-protection system. COLORS 10=Artic White, 11=Pewter Metallic, 13=Silver Metallic, 20=Medium Blue Metallic, 28=Navy Blue Metallic, 31=Bright Green Metallic, 41=Black, 79=Blue-Green Chameleon and 81=Bright Red. Firebird – Series F/ V6 The availability of GM's Traction Control system was extended to the V-6-powered Firebirds this year. All Firebirds with V-8 and some with a V-6 had a Zexel Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. Also new was a solenoid-based Bosch antilock braking system. An enhanced Sensing and Diagnostic Module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment. Standard equipment for the Firebird coupe included extensive acoustical insulation, dual front airbags, air conditioning, a black fixed-mast antenna at right rear, a brake/transmission shift interlock safety feature (with automatic transmission), power four-wheel disc brakes with four-wheel ABS, the UPC L36 3800 Series II 200 hp SFI V-6 engine, cruise control, electric rear- and side-window defoggers, Solar-Ray tinted glass, instrumentation (including electric analog speedometer, tachometer, odometer, coolant temperature indicator, oil pressure gauge, voltmeter and LED trip odometer), sport exterior mirrors (left-hand remote controlled, right-hand manual), a day/night inside rearview mirror with reading lamps, left- and right-hand covered visor-vanity mirrors, a Delco AM/FM stereo ETR radio and cassette (with seven-band graphic equalizer, touch control, search-and-replay, Delco TheftLock, clock, seek up/down, remote CD pre-wiring and four-speaker coaxial sound system), reclining front bucket seats, four-way driver and passenger front seat manual adjusters, a rear two-passenger folding seat, a four-spoke sport tilt steering wheel with adjustable column, the PASS-Key II theft-deterrent system, P215/60R16 touring tires with a high-pressure compact spare, the UPC MM5 five-speed manual transmission, controlled-cycle windshield wipers and bright silver 16-in. five-spoke cast-aluminum wheels.

For 1998–2002 Pontiac used the same heavy duty brakes, steering ratios, fuel pumps and shocks (non-WS6) on both V6 and V8 models. The all-aluminum 5.7 L V8 engine was sourced from the Corvette C5, and produced at 5,200 rpm; at 4,000 rpm, (310 after 2000) or 320 hp (325 after 2000) in the WS-6 ""Ram Air"" version. In 2001 and 2002, models equipped with a V8 received the high-flow LS6 intake manifold and a high-performance clutch. A Firehawk model, produced by SLP and sold through Pontiac dealerships, had 330 hp (335 after 2000, 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the optional Blackwing intake. The V6-equipped Firebirds were rated at . Firebird Trans Am. The Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading handling, suspension, and horsepower, as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive hoods, spoilers, fog lights and wheels. In using the name Trans Am, a registered trademark, GM agreed to pay $5 per car sold to the SCCA. Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002. These cars were built on the F-body platform, which was also shared by the Chevrolet Camaro. Despite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the Trans Am Series, as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA's five liter displacement limit. The second generation was available from 1970 to 1981 and was featured in the 1977 movie ""Smokey and the Bandit"", the 1978 movie ""Hooper"" and the 1980 movie ""Smokey and the Bandit II"". The third generation, available from 1982 to 1992, was featured in the 1983 movie ""Smokey and the Bandit Part 3"" and the 1984 movie ""Alphabet City"". KITT, the automotive star, and its evil counterpart KARR, of the popular 1980s TV series ""Knight Rider"", was a modified third generation Trans Am. The fourth generation Trans Am, available from model years 1993 to 2002, offered between and .The Trans AM GTA (Grand Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added Gold 16 inch diamond spoke allow wheels, a mono-chromatic paint scheme and special cloisonné GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level trans am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the ""ultimate"" Trans am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16' gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance Ws6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of a L98 5.7 liter (350 ci) TPI (Tuned Port Injection) V8 mated to GM's corporate 700r4 automatic transmission or the 5.0 liter (305 ci) TPI V8. A five speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 liter only.  The fastest TA Originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac, the 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am project was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The V6 turbo engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM's plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The actual number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo TAs were manufactured. Firebird Trans Am GTA (Third Generation F-body) Recording and performing artist Ke$ha has mentioned her own gold Trans Am in several of her songs, including ""Take It Off"", ""Thinking of You"" and the ultimate Trans Am tribute song, ""Gold Trans Am"", a bonus track from the deluxe edition of her second studio album Warrior. Engines. Third generation. From 1982 on all engines are Chevrolet sourced, unless stated otherwise. Racing. Firebirds were used in the Trans-Am series in the 1960s and 1970s. When the Pontiac Trans Am came out, there was controversy over the model's inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6 liters). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the SCCA, who threatened suit. GM settled the dispute by paying US$5 to the SCCA for every car sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. Firebirds were used in the IROC Series until it folded after the 2006 season. During the 1995, 1996, and 1997 NHRA seasons, 14-time Funny Car champion John Force used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete Oldsmobile Cutlass and Chevrolet Lumina body he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver. The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the Pro Stock class in 1995, forcing drivers Warren Johnson, Jerry Eckman, and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year, none of them would win with the first year of the Firebird body, but Pro Stock driver Jim Yates, a second year driver, using the Firebird body, would.

wikipedia-386232," Psychosynthesis  Psychosynthesis is an approach to psychology that was developed by Roberto Assagioli, M.D. He compared psychosynthesis to the prevailing thinking of the day, contrasting psychosynthesis for example with Existential psychology, but unlike the latter considered loneliness not to be ""either ultimate or essential."". Assagioli asserted that ""the direct experience of the self, of pure ""self-awareness""... - is true."" Spiritual goals of ""Self-Realization"", and the ""interindividual psychosynthesis"" - of 'social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the ""one humanity""' - were central to Assagioli's theory. Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method but many conferences and publications had it as central theme and centres were formed in Italy and the USA in the 1960s. Psychosynthesis departed from the empirical foundations of psychology in that it studied a person as a personality and a soul but Assagioli continued to insist that it was scientific. Assagioli developed therapeutic methods beyond those found in psychoanalysis. Although the unconscious is an important part of his theory, Assagioli was careful to maintain a balance with rational, conscious therapeutical work. Assagioli 'was not the first to use the term, psychosynthesis, it was also used by Bezzoli'. Freud for his part used the same term as the goal for the patient in psychoanalysis: 'As we analyse...the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it. The psycho-synthesis is thus achieved in analytic treatment without our intervention, automatically and inevitably'. Origins. In 1909, C.G. Jung wrote to Sigmund Freud of “a very pleasant and perhaps valuable acquaintance, our first Italian, a Dr. Assagioli from the psychiatric clinic in Florence”. Later however, this same Roberto Assagioli (1888–1974) wrote a doctoral dissertation, “La Psicosintesi,” in which he began to move away from Freud’s psychoanalysis towards what he called psychosynthesis:   A beginning of my conception of psychosynthesis was contained in my doctoral thesis on Psychoanalysis (1910), in which I pointed out what I considered to be some of the limitations of Freud’s views.  In developing psychosynthesis, Assagioli agreed with Freud that healing childhood trauma and developing a healthy ego were necessary aims of psychotherapy, but held that human growth could not be limited to this alone. A student of philosophical and spiritual traditions of both East and West, Assagioli sought to address human growth as it proceeded beyond the norm of the well-functioning ego; he wished also to support the blossoming of human potential into what Abraham Maslow later termed self-actualization, and further still, into the spiritual or transpersonal dimensions of human experience as well.  In other words, Assagioli envisioned an approach to the human being which could address both the process of personal growth—of personality integration and self-actualization—as well as transpersonal development—that dimension glimpsed for example in peak experiences (Maslow) of inspired creativity, spiritual insight, and unitive states of consciousness. In addition, psychosynthesis recognizes the process of Self-realization, of contact and response with one’s deepest callings and directions in life, which can involve either or both personal and transpersonal development.  Psychosynthesis is therefore one of the earliest forerunners of both humanistic psychology and transpersonal psychology, even preceding Jung’s break with Freud by several years. Assagioli’s conception has an affinity with existential-humanistic psychology and other approaches which attempt to understand the nature of the healthy personality, personal responsibility and choice, and the actualization of the personal self; similarly, his conception is related to the field of transpersonal psychology, with its focus on higher states of consciousness, spirituality, and human experiencing beyond the individual self. Accordingly, Assagioli served on the board of editors for both the ""Journal of Humanistic Psychology"" and the ""Journal of Transpersonal Psychology"".  Assagioli presents the two major theoretical models in his seminal book, Psychosynthesis, models that have remained fundamental to psychosynthesis theory and practice through the years. These two models are 1) a diagram and description of the human person, and the other 2) a stage theory of the process of psychosynthesis (see below). Aims. In Psychosomatic Medicine and Bio-psychosynthesis, Roberto Assagioli states that the principal aims and tasks of psychosynthesis are: In his major book, ""Psychosynthesis: A Collection of Basic Writings"" (1965), Assagioli writes of three aims of psychosynthesis: Let us examine whether and how it is possible to solve this central problem of human life, to heal this fundamental infirmity of man. Let us see how he may free himself from this enslavement and achieve an harmonious inner integration, true Self-realization, and right relationships with others. (p. 21) Model of the person. Lower unconscious. For Assagioli, 'the lower unconscious, which contains one's personal psychological past in the form of repressed complexes, long-forgotten memories and dreams and imaginations', stood at the base of the diagram of the mind. The lower unconscious is that realm of the person to which is relegated the experiences of shame, fear, pain, despair, and rage associated with primal wounding suffered in life. One way to think of the lower unconscious is that it is a particular bandwidth of one’s experiential range that has been broken away from consciousness. It comprises that range of experience related to the threat of personal annihilation, of destruction of self, of nonbeing, and more generally, of the painful side of the human condition. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious, the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or others in the more painful aspects of human life. At the same time, 'the lower unconscious merely represents the most primitive part of ourselves...It is not ""bad"", it is just ""earlier"" '. Indeed, 'the ""lower"" side has many attractions and great vitality', and - as with Freud's id, or Jung's shadow - the conscious goal must be to 'achieve a creative tension' with the lower unconscious. Middle unconscious. The middle unconscious is a sector of the person whose contents, although unconscious, nevertheless support normal conscious functioning in an ongoing way (thus it is illustrated as most immediate to “I”). It is the capacity to form patterns of skills, behaviors, feelings, attitudes, and abilities that can function without conscious attention, thereby forming the infrastructure of one’s conscious life. The function of the middle unconscious can be seen in all spheres of human development, from learning to walk and talk, to acquiring languages, to mastering a trade or profession, to developing social roles. Anticipating today's neuroscience, Assagioli even referred to ""developing new neuromuscular patterns"". All such elaborate syntheses of thought, feeling, and behavior are built upon learnings and abilities that must eventually operate unconsciously. For Assagioli, 'Human healing and growth that involves work with either the middle or the lower unconscious is known as ""personal psychosynthesis"" '. Higher unconscious. Assagioli termed 'the sphere of aesthetic experience, creative inspiration, and higher states of consciousness...the ""higher unconscious"" '. The higher unconscious (or superconscious) denotes “our higher potentialities which seek to express themselves, but which we often repel and repress” (Assagioli). As with the lower unconscious, this area is by definition not available to consciousness, so its existence is inferred from moments in which contents from that level affect consciousness. Contact with the higher unconscious can be seen in those moments, termed peak experiences by Maslow, which are often difficult to put into words, experiences in which one senses deeper meaning in life, a profound serenity and peace, a universality within the particulars of existence, or perhaps a unity between oneself and the cosmos. This level of the unconscious represents an area of the personality that contains the “heights” overarching the “depths” of the lower unconscious. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious - in what Desoille termed '""repression of the sublime""' - the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or other in the more sublime aspects of human life. The higher unconscious thus represents 'an autonomous realm, from where we receive our higher intuitions and inspirations - altruistic love and will, humanitarian action, artistic and scientific inspiration, philosophic and spiritual insight, and the drive towards purpose and meaning in life'. It may be compared to Freud's superego, seen as 'the higher, moral, supra-personal side of human nature...a higher nature in man', incorporating 'Religion, morality, and a social sense - the chief elements in the higher side of man...putting science and art to one side'. Subpersonalities. Subpersonalities based in the personal unconscious form a central strand in psychosynthesis thinking. 'One of the first people to have started really making use of subpersonalities for therapy and personal growth was Roberto Assagioli', psychosynthesis reckoning that 'subpersonalities exist at various levels of organization, complexity, and refinement' throughout the mind. A five-fold process of recognition, acceptance, co-ordination, integration, and synthesis 'leads to the discovery of the Transpersonal Self, and the realization that that is the final truth of the person, not the subpersonalities'. Some subpersonalities may be seen 'as psychological contents striving to emulate an archetype...""degraded expressions of the archetypes of higher qualities"" '. Others will resist the process of integration; will 'take the line that it is difficult being alive, and it is far easier - and safer - to stay in an undifferentiated state'. “I”. “I” is the direct ""reflection"" or ""projection"" of Self (Assagioli) and the essential being of the person, distinct but not separate from all contents of experience. “I” possesses the two functions of consciousness, or awareness, and will, whose field of operation is represented by the concentric circle around “I” in the oval diagram - Personal Will. Psychosynthesis suggests that 'we can experience the will as having four stages. The first stage could be described as ""having no will""', and might perhaps be linked with the hegemony of the lower unconscious. 'The next stage of the will is understanding that ""will exists"". We might still feel that we cannot actually do it, but we know...it is possible'. 'Once we have developed our will, at least to some degree, we pass to the next stage which is called ""having a will""', and thereafter 'in psychosynthesis we call the fourth and final stage of the evolution of the will in the individual ""being will""' - which then 'relates to the ""I"" or self...draws energy from the transpersonal self'. The ""I"" is placed at the center of the field of awareness and will in order to indicate that “I” is the one who has consciousness and will. It is “I” who is aware of the psyche-soma contents as they pass in and out of awareness; the contents come and go, while “I” may remain present to each experience as it arises. But “I” is dynamic as well as receptive: “I” has the ability to affect the contents of awareness and can even affect awareness itself, by choosing to focus awareness (as in many types of meditation), expand it, or contract it. Since “I” is distinct from any and all contents and structures of experience, “I” can be thought of as not a “self” at all but as “noself.” That is, “I” is never the object of experience. “I” is who can experience, for example, the ego disintegrating and reforming, who can encounter emptiness and fullness, who can experience utter isolation or cosmic unity, who can engage any and all arising experiences. “I” is not any particular experience but the experiencer, not object but subject, and thus cannot be seen or grasped as an object of consciousness. This “noself” view of “I” can be seen in Assagioli’s discussion of “I” as a reflection of Self: “The reflection appears to be self-existent but has, in reality, no autonomous substantiality. It is, in other words, not a new and different light but a projection of its luminous source”. The next section describes this “luminous source”, Self. Self. Pervading all the areas mapped by the oval diagram, distinct but not separate from all of them, is Self (which has also been called Higher Self or Transpersonal Self). The concept of Self points towards a source of wisdom and guidance within the person, a source which can operate quite beyond the control of the conscious personality. Since Self pervades all levels, an ongoing lived relationship with Self—Self-realization—may lead anywhere on the diagram as one's direction unfolds (this is one reason for not illustrating Self at the top of the diagram, a representation that tends to give the impression that Self-realization leads only into the higher unconscious). Relating to Self may lead for example to engagement with addictions and compulsions, to the heights of creative and religious experience, to the mysteries of unitive experience, to issues of meaning and mortality, to grappling with early childhood wounding, to discerning a sense of purpose and meaning in life. The relationship of ""I"" and Self is paradoxical. Assagioli was clear that “I” and Self were from one point of view one, writing, “There are not really two selves, two independent and separate entities. The Self is one”. Such a nondual unity is a fundamental aspect of this level of experience. But Assagioli also understood that there could be a meaningful relationship between the person and Self as well: Accounts of religious experiences often speak of a “call” from God, or a “pull” from some Higher Power; this sometimes starts a “dialogue” between the man woman and this “higher Source”... Assagioli did not of course limit this relationship and dialogue to those dramatic experiences of “call” seen in the lives of great men and women throughout history. Rather, the potential for a conscious relationship with Self exists for every person at all times and may be assumed to be implicit in every moment of every day and in every phase of life, even when one does not recognize this. Whether within one’s private inner world of feelings, thoughts, and dreams, or within one’s relationships with other people and the natural world, a meaningful ongoing relationship with Self may be lived. Stages.  Writing about the model of the person presented above, Assagioli states that it is a “structural, static, almost ‘anatomical’ representation of our inner constitution, while it leaves out its dynamic aspect, which is the most important and essential one”. Thus he follows this model immediately with a stage theory outlining the process of psychosynthesis. This scheme can be called the “stages of psychosynthesis,” and is presented here.  It is important to note that although the linear progression of the following stages does make logical sense, these stages may not in fact be experienced in this sequence; they are not a ladder up which one climbs, but aspects of a single process. Further, one never outgrows these stages; any stage can be present at any moment throughout the process of Psychosynthesis, Assaglioli acknowledging 'persisting traits belonging to preceding psychological ages' and the perennial possibility of 'retrogression to primitive stages'. The stages of Psychosynthesis may be tabulated as follows: 1. Thorough knowledge of one's personality. 2. Control of its various elements. 3. Realization of one's true Self -- the discovery or creation of a unifying center.  4. Psychosynthesis: the formation or reconstruction of the personality around a new center. Methods. Psychosynthesis was regarded by Assagioli as more of an orientation and a general approach to the whole human being, and as existing apart from any of its particular concrete applications. This approach allows for a wide variety of techniques and methods to be used within the psychosynthesis context. 'Dialogue, Gestalt techniques, dream work, guided imagery, affirmations, and meditation are all powerful tools for integration', but 'the attitude and presence of the guide are of far greater importance than the particular methods used'. Sand tray, art therapy, journaling, drama therapy, and body work; cognitive-behavioral techniques; object relations, self psychology, and family systems approaches, may all be used in different contexts, from individual and group psychotherapy, to meditation and self-help groups. Psychosynthesis offers an overall view which can help orient oneself within the vast array of different modalities available today, and be applied either for therapy or for self-actualization. One broad classification of the techniques used involves the following headings: ' Analytical: To help identify blocks and enable the exploration of the unconscious'. Psychosynthesis stresses 'the importance of using obstacles as steps to growth' - 'blessing the obstacle...blocks are our helpers'.  ' Mastery...the eight psychological functions need to be gradually retrained to produce permanent positive change'.  ' Transformation...the refashioning of the personality around a new centre'.  ' Grounding...into the concrete terms of daily life. ' Relational...to cultivate qualities such as love, openness and empathy'. Psychosynthesis allows practitioners the recognition and validation of an extensive range of human experience: the vicissitudes of developmental difficulties and early trauma; the struggle with compulsions, addictions, and the trance of daily life; the confrontation with existential identity, choice, and responsibility; levels of creativity, peak performance, and spiritual experience; and the search for meaning and direction in life. None of these important spheres of human existence need be reduced to the other, and each can find its right place in the whole. This means that no matter what type of experience is engaged, and no matter what phase of growth is negotiated, the complexity and uniqueness of the person may be respected—a fundamental principle in any application of psychosynthesis. Criticism. Psychosynthesis, for better or worse, 'has always been on the fringes of the ""official"" therapy world', and it 'is only recently that the concepts and methods of psychoanalysis and group analysis have been introduced into the training and practice of psychosynthesis psychotherapy'. As a result, the movement has been at times exposed to the dangers of fossilisation and cultism, so that on occasion, having 'started out reflecting the high-minded spiritual philosophy of its founder, became more and more authoritarian, more and more strident in its conviction that psychosynthesis was the One Truth'. A more technical danger is that premature concern with the transpersonal may hamper dealing with personal psychosynthesis: for example, 'evoking serenity...might produce a false sense of well-being and security'. Practitioners have noted how 'inability to...integrate the superconscious contact with everyday experience easily leads to inflation', and have spoken of 'an ""Icarus complex"", the tendency whereby spiritual ambition fails to take personality limitations into account and causes all sorts of psychological difficulties'. Fictional analogies. Stephen Potter's 'Lifemanship Psycho-Synthesis Clinic', where you may 'find the psycho-synthesist lying relaxed on the couch while the patient will be encouraged to walk up and down' would seem a genuine case of ""parallel evolution"", since its clear targets, as 'the natural antagonists...of the lifeplay, are the psychoanalysts'.

wikipedia-386236," Kitchener Rangers  The Kitchener Rangers are a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League that have called Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, their home since 1963. The Rangers are a publicly owned hockey team, governed by a 40-person Board of Directors made up of season ticket subscribers. The Rangers hosted the 2008 Memorial Cup tournament. They are also one of the most successful CHL teams in terms of NHL alumni with over 140 players including Mike Richards, Dale Hunter, David Clarkson, Steve Mason, Derek Roy, Steve Downie, 2011 Calder Trophy winner Jeff Skinner, 2012 Calder Trophy winner Gabriel Landeskog, and Hall of Famers Scott Stevens, Bill Barber, Paul Coffey, Larry Robinson and Al MacInnis. History. The roots of the Kitchener Rangers are traced back to the 1947–48 hockey season when the franchise was formed as the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters. In 1960 the ""Biltmores"" as they were often called became the Guelph Royals. At the end of the 1962–63 season, a local business entrepreneur named Eugene George was approached by the New York Rangers about moving the team to Kitchener in hopes of building a more stable junior environment. The team moved into the Kitchener Auditorium for the start of the 1963–64 season, which had previously been home to the Kitchener Greenshirts and the Kitchener Canucks. The Rangers were successful promoting the team in the community, drawing high attendance despite a poor first season. By 1968 the Rangers were a first place team that had reached the league finals twice. When the National Hockey League collectively ended sponsorship of junior teams, the New York Rangers then offered the team to Eugene George for $1.00, a token receipt to assume the financial and overall responsibility of the team from then on. There is no truth to the urban legend that the New York Rangers could re-acquire the team at any time for $1.00. George, realizing the community importance of the Kitchener Rangers, instead turned the team over to the community; in essence, to its season ticket subscribers. The Rangers became a ""publicly"" owned team in that each season ticket holder is a Member of the not-for-profit corporation which owns the team and all its assets. It is often said, incorrectly, that the team is ""community owned"". George and colleagues strategically set up a volunteer Directorship, which included key Executives, which still holds true today (elected from among all eligible season ticket subscribers). The Rangers are backboned today by their unique strategy; a 40-person Board of Directors to which 9 Executive positions are elected as key duties including Finances, Policies, Charities, and a Hockey Committee among others. The Rangers struggled their first three season in the OHA, but finished strong in 1966 despite a 7th place 16–23–9 record. The Rangers won the first two playoff rounds to make it to the OHA finals, but lost 4 games to 1, to the Oshawa Generals, featuring a young Bobby Orr. Kitchener finished in 1st place the next season, but fell to the Hamilton Red Wings in the playoffs. In 1968 the Rangers were first again in the OHA, and won their second consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy. Kitchener played in the finals again, losing a very close series 4 games to 3 with a tie, to the eventual Memorial Cup Champions Niagara Falls Flyers. Kitchener struggled through the decade, posting only two winning seasons. In 1973–74, the Rangers finish 1st in the OHA due to the stellar goalkeeping of Don Edwards, with the league lowest goals against average. Kitchener however lost in the semi-finals in the playoffs. Dwight Foster set the Rangers franchise record for points in a highest during the high scoring late 1970s. Foster scored 60 goals and 83 assists totalling 143 points to be the scoring champion. Memorial Cup 1981. The Rangers coached by Orval Tessier finished first place in a highly contested Emms division, despite winning only half its games. The team made a remarkable turnaround from its previous dismal season. The 1981 Rangers were led by 16 year old captain Brian Bellows, and also featured Al MacInnis, Mike Eagles and goalie Wendell Young. Kitchener caught fire in the playoffs eliminating the Niagara Falls Flyers and the Windsor Spitfires in the Emms division playoffs, then eliminated the highly favoured Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the league finals, who finished 27 points ahead of Kitchener. Tessier returned to the Memorial Cup for the fourth time, after playing for the 1953 Barrie Flyers, and coaching the 1972 Cornwall Royals and 1973 Quebec Remparts. Kitchener faced off against the Victoria Cougars and the defending champions, the Cornwall Royals, in the Memorial Cup played in Windsor, Ontario, and the Windsor Arena. Kitchener lost the first two games 6–3 to Cornwall, and 7–4 to Victoria. The Rangers then posted consecutive victories, 6–4 over the Royals in which Bellows scored a hat trick, and 4–2 over the Cougars. In the finals versus Cornwall, the Rangers fell 5–2 to the Royals who would win their second consecutive Memorial Cup title.

As Liambas checked Fanelli into the boards behind the Rangers net, Fanelli's head hit a metal partition in the glass, breaking and knocking off his helmet. Fanelli lay unconscious while twitching and foaming at the mouth before being rushed to hospital in critical condition with skull and orbital bone fractures. Fanelli was released from Hamilton General Hospital a week later on November 6. Liambas was suspended for the remainder of the season and the playoffs by OHL commissioner David Branch, who cited the speed and distance to which Liambas skated to deliver the check, as well as the severity of Fanelli's injuries. He commented that the suspension was responding to a ""need to take strong steps to ... send out the message to all our players and minor hockey players that we have to be ... more respectful of our opponent.""

Updated as of September 19, 2013 Yearly results. Regular season. Legend: OTL = Overtime loss, SL = Shootout loss Uniforms and logos. When the Rangers first appeared in Kitchener, their sweater design mimicked their NHL sponsor, the New York Rangers, with the Ranger letters set diagonally across the sweater. The Kitchener Rangers colours have always been blue, red and white. In 1992 the Rangers incorporated a character into their uniform to boost souvenir sales. The initial design had a Texas Ranger riding a horse. In all the logo went through 3 designs for their regular jerseys involving Tex first displaying Tex riding the horse in a circular logo, then altering the circular logo into a shield and then finally removing the horse. Tex was also featured on the Rangers' third jersey in the late 1990s, with a revised-looking Tex face with a menacing look and prominent grey moustache with a western-style star behind it. The jersey actually prompted a re-model of the tex mascot from a round happy tex, to a new ""Tex"" with more attitude, that mascot is still in use today, though the jersey was informally retired. For the 2000–01 OHL season the Rangers reverted to their classic style New York Rangers sweaters. The Rangers wore a third jersey from 2005–07. [http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?lo=6793] It displayed horizontal red and blue bars on a white background with the Rangers shield shoulder patches. In 2010, a new third jersey was unveiled.

wikipedia-386241," Interstate 880  Interstate 880 (I-880) is an Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area connecting San Jose and Oakland, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay. For most of its route, I-880 is officially known as the Nimitz Freeway, after World War II fleet admiral Chester Nimitz, who retired to the Bay Area and lived on Yerba Buena Island. This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System. Route description. The southern terminus of I-880 is at its interchange with Interstate 280 and State Route 17 in San Jose. From there, it heads roughly northeast past the San Jose International Airport to U.S. Route 101. The Nimitz Freeway then turns northwest, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay, connecting the cities of Milpitas, Fremont, Newark, Union City, Hayward, and San Leandro before reaching Oakland. In Oakland, I-880 passes by Oakland International Airport, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and Downtown Oakland. The northern terminus of I-880 is in Oakland at the junction with Interstate 80 and Interstate 580 (known as the MacArthur Maze), near the eastern approach of the Bay Bridge. I-880 between I-238 in San Leandro and the MacArthur Maze is used as an alternate truck route; trucks over 4.5 tons are prohibited through Oakland on I-580. Officially, the Nimitz Freeway designation is Route 880 from Route 101 to Route 80, as named by Senate Concurrent Resolution 23, Chapter 84 in 1958. History. The state legislature added the proposed San Jose-Richmond East Shore Highway to the state highway system in 1933, and it became an extension of the previously short (San Rafael to the bay) Legislative Route 69, and part of Sign Route 13 (soon changed to 17) in 1934. From San Jose, this route temporarily followed existing Legislative Route 5 (present Oakland Road, Main Street, Milpitas Boulevard, and Warm Springs Boulevard) to SR 21 at Warm Springs, and then continued along existing county roads and city streets, now known as Fremont Boulevard, Alvarado Boulevard, Hesperian Boulevard, Lewelling Boulevard, Washington Avenue, 14th Street, 44th Avenue, 12th Street, 14th Avenue, 8th Street, and 7th Street, into downtown Oakland. It then turned north at Cypress Street (now Mandela Parkway), passing through the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure and following a newly constructed alignment (signed as US 40) to El Cerrito. The first short piece of the new Eastshore Freeway opened to traffic on July 22, 1949, connecting Oak Street downtown with 23rd Avenue. It was extended to 98th Avenue on June 1, 1950, Lewelling Boulevard on June 13, 1952, and Jackson Street (SR 92) on June 5, 1953. At the San Jose end, the overlap with Route 5 between Bayshore Highway (US 101) and Warm Springs was bypassed on July 2, 1954. Within Oakland, the double-decker Cypress Street Viaduct opened on June 11, 1957, connecting the freeway with the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge. The Oakland segment was extended south to Fremont Boulevard at Beard Road on November 14, 1957, and the gap was filled on November 24, 1958, soon after the state legislature named the highway after Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. (The short spur to Route 5 at Warm Springs (now SR 262) remained in the state highway system as a branch of Route 69.) As these sections opened, Sign Route 17 (and Legislative Route 69) was moved from its old surface routing, which mostly became local streets. Other than Route 5 south of Warm Springs, the portion from San Leandro into Oakland was also kept as part of Route 105 (now SR 185). State Route 17. Prior to 1984, the route known as I-880 used to be part of State Route 17. SR 17 used to run from Santa Cruz all the way through San Jose, Oakland; and then continued north via the Eastshore Freeway (Interstate 80) through Richmond to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and San Rafael. In 1984 the segment of SR 17 from Interstate 280 in San Jose to the MacArthur Maze in Oakland was renumbered as I-880, and the portion of SR 17 from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael was renumbered as part of I-580. Nimitz Freeway. In 1947, construction commenced on a freeway to replace the street routing of SR 17 through the East Bay. The new freeway was named the ""Eastshore Freeway"", and with the subsequent addition of a freeway to replace the Eastshore ""Highway"" north of the MacArthur Maze in the mid 1950s, it ran, appropriately, almost the entire length of the east shore of San Francisco Bay. In 1958, the portion south of the MacArthur Maze was renamed the Nimitz Freeway in honor of WWII Admiral Nimitz, while the portion to the north retained the name Eastshore Freeway. Historic Business U.S. Route 50. The northern portion of I-880 was designated Business U.S. Route 50 for a time between the I-80 interchange and downtown Oakland. Original routing of I-880 in Sacramento. From 1971 to 1983, Interstate 880 was also the route designation for the Beltline Freeway, the northern bypass freeway for the Sacramento area. This freeway begins in West Sacramento as a fork from the original Interstate 80, continues northeast over the Sacramento River to its interchange with Interstate 5, continues east through the communities of North Sacramento and Del Paso Heights and ends at an interchange with the Roseville Freeway Interstate 80. Watt Avenue, and the now designated Capital City Freeway (which was originally I-80 continuing southwest directly into downtown Sacramento). Cypress Viaduct Loma Prieta earthquake 1989. A large double-decker section in Oakland, known as the Cypress Street Viaduct, collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, causing 42 deaths. This was the greatest loss of life caused by that earthquake. Rebuilding the affected section of the freeway took nearly a decade, due to environmental impact concerns, the feeling that the freeway divided the neighborhood, and design considerations. The freeway reopened in 1997 on a new route parallel to railroad tracks around the outskirts of West Oakland. Although only about three miles (5 km) in length, the replacement freeway cost over $1.2 billion, for several reasons: it crossed over ""and"" under the elevated BART line to San Francisco; it squeezed between a post office, the West Oakland BART station, the Port of Oakland, a rail yard, and a sewage treatment plant; it occupied an entirely new right-of-way, which required the acquisition of large amounts of valuable industrial real estate near the Port of Oakland; and of course, it had to be earthquake-proof. The former path of the structure, Cypress Street, was renamed Mandela Parkway, and the median where the freeway stood became a landscaped linear park. Flood plains. Several aspects of the I-880 facility have been constructed in designated floodplains such as the 1990 interchange improvements at Dixon Landing Road. In that case the Federal Highway Administration was required to make a finding that there was no feasible alternative to the new ramp system as designed. In that same study, the FHWA produced an analysis to support the fact that adequate wetlands mitigation had been designed into the improvement project. Sound barriers. Due to high sound levels generated from this highway and the relatively dense urban development in the highway corridor, Caltrans has conducted numerous studies to retrofit the right-of-way with noise barriers. This activity has occurred in Oakland, San Leandro, Hayward, Newark and Fremont. During the 1989 widening of I-880 in parts of Newark and Fremont, scientific studies were conducted to determine the need for sound walls and to design optimum heights to achieve Federal noise standards. Gasoline tanker accident in 2007. On April 29, 2007, a gasoline tanker overturned and caught fire on the connector between westbound I-80 and southbound I-880 on the MacArthur Maze interchange. The fire caused major damage to both this connector and one directly above (eastbound I-80 onto eastbound I-580). The overpass was replaced and re-opened 27 days later. The governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declared it as a State of emergency and all public transportation was free on the first commute day. 2010 I-880/I-280 Interchange improvement. In 2010 improvements to the I-280/I-880 and Stevens Creek Boulevard interchanges were made. Previously, both interchanges shared a handful of ramps, but they are now independent from one another. Future. The I-880 Corridor Improvement Project, one of the last seismic retrofit projects of a major transportation corridor in California, consists of eight separate projects located in a 15-mile segment of the freeway between Oakland and Hayward. The overall goal of the project is to improve the seismic safety of the corridor. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) initiated Phase 1 of its seismic retrofit program. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Caltrans initiated Phase 2 of its seismic retrofit program, which included projects along the I-880 corridor. Other goals include reducing traffic congestion and improving road quality. The individual projects included in the I-880 Corridor Improvement project are the retrofitting or replacement of the 5th Avenue, 23rd Avenue, 29th Avenue, Fruitvale Avenue, and High Street bridges in Oakland; improvements to both the I-238 and Highway 92 interchanges (the latter, a four year project, completed in October 2011); and an overall rehabilitation/repaving project along the entire segment. Construction will take place from 2006 to 2014, although individual project schedules vary. The total cost of the project is $462.7 million, provided by federal, state, and regional funds. "
wikipedia-386244," Jerez de la Frontera  Jerez de la Frontera is a municipality in the province of Cádiz in the autonomous community of Andalusia, () in southwestern Spain, situated midway between the sea and the mountains. , the city, the largest in the province, had 215,180 inhabitants; it is the fifth largest in Andalusia. It has become the transportation and communications hub of the province, surpassing even Cádiz, the provincial capital, in economic activity. Jerez de la Frontera is also, in terms of land area, the largest municipality in the province, and its sprawling outlying areas are a fertile zone for agriculture. There are also many cattle ranches and horse-breeding operations, as well as a world-renowned wine industry. Government. The city of Jerez is governed by the ""ayuntamiento"" (municipality) of Jerez, whose representatives, as in other towns in Spain, are elected every four years by universal suffrage for all citizens older than 18 years of age. The body is chaired by the mayor of Jerez. Economy. The economy of Jerez has traditionally been centered on the wine industry, with exports of sherry worldwide. Because it lacks the civil service that other cities enjoy, Jerez has based its economy on industry. The cultivation of fruits, grains, and vegetables and horse and cattle husbandry has also been important to the local economy. It is the home base for the Spanish Military Stud farm, the Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera. After the wine crisis in the 1990s, the city is now seeking to expand its industrial base. Tourism has been successfully promoted. The city's strong identity as a center for wine, flamenco, and horses, its popular festivals, MotoGP hosting and its historical heritage have contributed to this success. The city is the home of Jerez Airport and has also been positioning itself as a logistics hub for western Andalucia, through the integration between the airport, the rail system and nearby ports. In May 2012, ""Time Magazine"" profiled Jerez as the most indebted town in Spain, the vanguard of Spain's impending economic collapse and the consequent dissolution of the European Union. Name. The name ""Jerez"" goes back to the Phoenician Xera, Sèrès, later Romanized under the name of ""Ceret""; the location of this settlement, however, remains unknown. The classical Latin name of Asta Regia, unrelated to the present name, referred to an ancient city now found within ""Mesas de Asta"", a rural district approximately from the center of Jerez. The current Castilian name came by way of the Arabic name . In former times, during the Muslim occupation of Iberia, it was called Xerez or Xeres. The name of the famous fortified wine, sherry, which originated here (although some argue that it originated in Shiraz, Persia), represents an adaptation of the city's Arabic name, which is pronounced Sherish. ""Frontera"" refers to a Spanish frontier, located on the border between the Moorish and Christian regions of Spain during that period, a regular host to skirmishes and clashes between the two regions. Over two centuries later, after the Castilian conquest of Granada in 1492, Xerez definitely lost its status as a frontier city, but did not lose that designation. After the Kingdom of Castile took Jerez on October 9, 1264, following the name given by the Muslims to the city in the period known as the Reconquista, the city was then called Xerez in medieval Castilian, transcribing the consonant (like the English sh) with the letter ⟨x⟩, as was the rule at the time. In the 16th century, the consonant changed into the consonant , with the corresponding spelling of ""Jerez"". The old spelling ""Xerez"" as the name given to the city survived in several foreign languages until very recently, and today continues to influence the name given to sherry: Portuguese ""Xerez"" , Catalan ""Xerès"" , English ""sherry"" , French ""Xérès"" , Italian ""Xeres"" . The city's main football team continues to use the old spelling, Xerez. History. There are signs of human presence in the area from the upper Neolithic, and Jerèz de la Frontera has been inhabited by humans since at least the Copper or Neolithic Age, but the identity of the first natives remains unclear. The first major protohistoric settlement in the area (around the third millennium BC) is attributed to the Tartessians. Later it was a Roman city, under the name of ""Asta Regia"". After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by the Vandals and the Visigoths, until it was conquered by the Arabs in 711. In the 11th century it was shortly the seat of an independent taifa. Some years later it was united to Arcos by 'Abdun ibn Muhammad, who ruled both c. 1040-1053. In 1053 it was annexed to Seville. From 1145 to 1147 the region of Arcos and Jerez was briefly an emirate under dependency of Granada, led by Abu'l-Qasim Ahyal. Later the city was conquered by the Almohads. In the 12th and 13th centuries Jerez underwent a period of great development, building its defense system and setting the current street layout of the old town. In 1231 the Battle of Jerez took place within the town's vicinity, in which the Christian troops under the command of Álvaro Pérez de Castro, lord of the House of Castro and grandson of Alfonso VII, king of Castile and León, defeated the troops of the Emir Ibn Hud, despite the numerical superiority of the latter. The city was conquered by Castile in 1264. The Discovery of America and the conquest of Granada, in 1492, made Jerez one of the most prosperous cities of Andalusia through trade and its proximity to the ports of Seville and Cádiz. Despite the social, economic and political decadence that occurred in the seventeenth century, towards the end of the Habsburg rule, the city managed to maintain a reasonable pace of development, becoming world wide famous for its wine industry. Climate. Jerez de la Frontera and the rest of the Cádiz metropolitan area has a Subtropical–Mediterranean climate with oceanic influences, characterized by very mild and wet winters and long warm to hot and dry summers. The average annual temperature is during the day and at night. The average annual precipitation is per year, concentrated in the months of October through April. December is the wettest month with . There are 54 rainy days per year, 137 clear days and 2,966 hours of sunshine a year. Culture. Jerez is known as the capital of sherry wine, horsemanship, and flamenco dancing. It is the home of the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art, a riding school comparable to the world-famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna. Jerez, the city where flamenco singing began, is also proud of its Andalusian Centre of Flamenco. There are two museums of note: the Jerez Archaeological Museum and the Atalaya Watch Museum (also known as ""Palace of Time""). The old quarter of Jerez, dating from medieval times, has been named an ""Artistic Historic Complex"". The Easter week celebrations in Jerez are of ""National Touristic Interest"", and its remarkable Horse Fair (Feria del Caballo) in May is an event of ""International Touristic Interest"". Sport. Jerez is present in most important national competitions. Clubs in different sports include: Jerez is also the site of Circuito de Jerez, formerly called the Circuito Permanente de Jerez, where the annual Motorcycle Grand Prix is contested. The race course is a prime destination for Formula One teams who wish to perform off-season testing; it also hosted the highly controversial 1997 European Grand Prix. Education. There are 76 elementary schools, 41 secondary schools, 12 adult education centers and 10 public libraries in the city of Jerez. The University of Cádiz, the provincial university, has a campus in Jerez. The city is also home to a member of the Official School of Languages (""Escuela Oficial de Idiomas"") and a center of the National Distance Education University (""Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia"", UNED). Demographics. According to official population data from INE, the municipality of Jerez had 205,364 inhabitants as of January 1, 2008. This makes Jerez the most populous city in the province, fifth in Andalusia, and 27th in Spain. Twin towns — Sister cities. Jerez de la Frontera is twinned with: "

In the 16th century mills were built using the River Erme's power. The parish of Saint John was formed in 1836. Ivybridge became a civil parish in 1894 and a town in 1977. The early urbanisation and development of Ivybridge largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. When the South Devon Railway Company built its train route through Ivybridge in the 19th century a paper mill was constructed alongside it and this led to an increase in housing nearby. The paper mill, now French owned, still provides local jobs. Although occasionally referred to as a dormitory town, many people work in the town itself, and agriculture continues to play an economic role for Ivybridge's hinterland. The area surrounding Ivybridge is almost completely farmland.  When heavy industry diminished during the latter half of the 20th century, the population has boomed (400% in 30 years) from 1,574 people in 1921 to 12,056 in 2001. History. The name Ivybridge is derived from a small 13th-century hump-backed bridge of the same name. Apart from swimming, it was the only means of crossing the river until 1819. ""Ivy"" was used to describe the bridge, because there was ivy growing on the bridge. As the bridge was the centre of the village and important to its very existence, it was named the ""parish of Ivybridge"" in 1894. Edmund Barron Hartley was born in Ivybridge on 6 May 1847. He was awarded the Victoria Cross in Moirosi's Mountain, Basuto War, 5 June 1879. The first mention of settlement in Ivybridge was the manor of Stowford in the Domesday Book of 1086. Although the first mention of Ivybridge came in 1280 when it was described as ""dowry of land on the west side of the River Erme, by the Ivy Bridge."" There was a chapel, that was on the site of Saint John's church, since 1402. From the 16th century onwards mills were built in the town, harnessing the power of the river. Records show that in the 16th century there was a corn mill, a tin mill and an edge mill. One of the mills, 'Glanville's Mill' (a corn mill), was situated where many of the town's shops are today and gives its name to the shopping centre. The first church (Saint John's) was built in 1790 as a chapel of ease, but 45 years later in 1835 it was consecrated as a district church. In 1819 the Ivy Bridge lost its position as the only means of crossing the river when the 'New Bridge' was built joining Fore Street and Exeter Road. In 1977 Ivybridge became a town. Throughout the 1980s and 90s it underwent a period of rapid growth, perhaps due to the A38 road by-pass. Between the censuses in 1981 and 2001 the population more than doubled from 5,106 to 12,056. Governance. Ivybridge is represented by five tiers of elected government.  5 Ivybridge Town Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government.  4 The next tier is the district council — South Hams District Council. They take care of matters such as local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.  3 The next tier is Devon County Council, who take care of much larger matter such as: education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire service trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.  2 The Parliament of the United Kingdom is responsible for matters such as education, health and justice. 1 The highest elected authority is the European Parliament in Brussels. It is a town and parish divided into three wards: Ivybridge Filham (the east of the town), Ivybridge Central (the central area of the town) and Ivybridge Woodlands (the west of the town). The current mayor is Councillor Trevor Parsons who was appointed in 2011. In 2007 Ivybridge town council won the Aon/NALC (National Association of Local Councils) Council of the Year. Its town hall is located close to the centre of the town and the previous town hall - Chapel Place is still in existence and located in the centre of the town close to the Ivy Bridge. Before 1894 Ivybridge was made up of four neighbouring parishes: Harford - north; Ugborough - east; Ermington - south and Cornwood - northwest. All the parishes’ boundaries met at the Ivy Bridge. In 1836 the Parish of Saint John was formed (the name of the church at the time, which was named after John the Evangelist). The parish represented the small central area of Ivybridge known at present. In 1894 St John's parish became a parish church for the newly created parish of Ivybridge. 83 years later the village and civil parish of Ivybridge became a town in 1977. Its local government district has been the South Hams since 1 April 1974 and its county constituency has been South West Devon since 1997.  The town forms part of the county constituency of South West Devon. Its Member of Parliament is Gary Streeter formerly an SDP politician, but now a member of the Conservative party who held 56% of the votes at the last election. The town’s three wards are each used for voting at the local elections and general elections. International links. Ivybridge's first official twinning was with Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives in 1972 before Ivybridge became a town. Since then it has developed unofficial town twinnings (exchanges) and Friendship Treaties. Shown below is a table of all the towns that Ivybridge holds international links with: Geography. At coordinates 50°23′28″N 3°55′12″W (50.233, -3.551) Ivybridge is situated deep in the south western peninsula of England, Ivybridge is from London, from Totnes and from Exeter. The main road in and out of the town (the A38) allows fast access to its nearby city Plymouth for many of Ivybridge’s commuters. The topography of Ivybridge is generally hilly. This is because of the River Erme which flows right through the centre of town. To the east and to the west of the river the land is elevated forming a valley. The river first enters the town at metres above sea level and leaves the town at metres above sea level. At its height the top of the east and west of the valley is metres above sea level. The western beacon is a hill that overlooks the town; its peak can be seen from almost anywhere in the town. It's metres above sea level and metres above the town. There is also an area of woodland called Longtimber woods to the north of the town, which attracts many walkers along its riverside path. The geology of Ivybridge is varied. Throughout most of the town the rock is Old Red Sandstone (sedimentary) from the Devonian period. To the north of the town Granite can be found as it is situated on the slopes of Dartmoor – a large pre-volcanic area of Granite. Along the River Erme large boulders and rocks can be found deposited on its meandering path brought all the way from Dartmoor; the Ivy Bridge itself is made out of Granite. The built environment in and around Ivybridge is mainly characterised by its suburban streets plans and houses, although in the centre of Ivybridge it’s mainly characterised by Victorian buildings. From the centre of the town most buildings are terraced and now many of these buildings have been converted into retail outlets along Fore Street – the town’s central business district. In the middle layer of the town most buildings are semi-detached and built on quite steep roads. More detached houses are found on the outer layers of the city on the east and on the west of the town. Over the past decades the town has been shaped by its two most essential pieces of infrastructure: the railway line to the north and the A38 dual carriageway to the south. No large scaling housing has been built on either side of these boundaries. Due to this Ivybridge has been forced to grow east and west rather than north and south; it stretches approximately from east to west and from north to south. Climate. Along with the rest of South West England, Ivybridge has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the British Isles. The annual mean temperature is approximately and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the British Isles. February is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months with mean daily maxima over . The climate of South West England has a favoured location with respect to the Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the British Isles, particularly in summer. Coastal areas have average annual sunshine totals over 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average annual rainfall is around . The number of days with snow falling is typically less than ten per winter. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west and, as a result, the air quality in Ivybridge may be reduced by the (proposed) construction of an incinerator southwest of the town (at the New England Quarry) with possible implications for health. Demography. Ivybridge’s most recent census indicates that Ivybridge had a population of 12,056. The United Kingdom Census 2001 was carried out by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, on Sunday, 29 April 2001. The next census to take place will be on 27 March. To put that figure into comparison with the area surrounding Ivybridge: it accounts for about 15% of the South Hams' total population (83,200) and it accounts for about 1% of Devon’s total population (1,122,100). The town has a median age of 36, which is below the national average of 39.9. The ethnicity of Ivybridge is predominately white with 99.4% of the population identifying themselves as white. According to the 2001 census, there were 78 people in Ivybridge who identify themselves as belonging to a black and/or minority ethnic group (0.65%). This is slightly lower than the local averages of the South Hams (0.9%) and Devon (1.1%), and much lower than the national average for England (9.1%). Economy. Ivybridge's earliest known economy relied on the River Erme with a corn mill, tin mill and an edge mill in existence in the town. Later development of the town relied on both the River Erme and the railway, which was part of the Industrial Revolution of the United Kingdom. The largest employer to the town during the Industrial Revolution was Stowford Paper Mill, which led to population growth in the town. The paper mill is still in use today providing jobs for the town. With the expansion of the town in the late 20th century much of the new jobs are in the service sector of industry. Due to the A38 Ivybridge's transport to nearby city Plymouth was made possible as a commuter route. As a result a lot of Ivybridge's work or ""economy"" is made in Plymouth and nearby towns. Ivybridge does still have some of its own industry with a small industrial estate at the south of the town and very nearby an industrial estate just to the east at Lee Mill. There have been attempts to brand the town as a walking centre for southern Dartmoor. There is good access to Dartmoor from the town. For example, one route follows the route of the old china clay railway to Redlake in the heart of the moor, another glides delightfully by the Erme through Longtimber Woods. There are other accesses to the Moor. The Two Moors Way, which crosses Dartmoor and Exmoor starts in Ivybridge and finishes in Lynmouth on the North Devon coast.  The shopping area is mainly along Fore Street and Glanvilles Mill and provides many jobs and services for the town, although the local schools combine to be biggest employers. There are some out of town jobs at the Tesco Extra superstore at Lee Mill and Endsleigh Garden & Leisure. The town has six traditional public houses: The Sportsmans, The Bridge, The Exchange, The Old Smithy, The Duke of Cornwall and The Imperial. Landmarks. The town's natural landmark is Western Beacon; a hill that overlooks the town. People walk up there for the views of Ivybridge and the South Hams. The town's first manmade landmark is the Ivy Bridge; a 13th-century hump-backed bridge covered in Ivy. It is still in use today and gives the name of the town – Ivybridge. The two remaining industrial landmarks of the town are the Viaduct over the River Erme and the Paper Mill. The original viaduct was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1848, only the granite piers remain. The operational line alongside was built by Sir James Charles Inglis in 1893 for the Great Western Railway. It still carries the main line trains. They were key to the town's initial growth in the Industrial Revolution and are still importance to the town today. In the centre of the town a war memorial was constructed and each year on Remembrance Day the town holds a ceremony to those who lost their lives, in recent years another memorial has also been built nearby commemorating the lives of American servicemen stationed in and near the town in 1944. Ivybridge Watermark. The modern landmark of the town, known as The Watermark began construction in 2007 and was completed in March 2008 at a cost of £1.4 million. The building is located on the North side of Erme Court opposite the town hall and houses: On the ground floor, an Information Centre, Library, Coffee Shop and IT Training facility; On the first floor, some large function rooms which are available for hire and are also used as a Cinema; On the second floor, 15 small office units forming an Innovation Centre for small-business startups. These offices are part of the South West Innovation Centres and are managed by the Torbay Development Agency. In 2012 The Watermark launched an exciting new Cinema Partnership with Curzon Cinemas, bringing a new era of varied and exciting programming for the Watermark & further improving the towns entertainment venue. Transport. Ivybridge has long been a staging post on the Exeter to Plymouth road dating back to the 13th century and the “Ivy Bridge” was the only way over the River Erme at the time. The bridge itself is still in use to this day taking cars (one-way) and pedestrians across the river. In 1819 a new bridge was built at the top of fore street (approximately 120 metres down the river). It is now used as a 1-way road across the river for vehicles and a separate pedestrian bridge lies alongside it. Another bridge (Marjorie Kelly Way/B3213) is situated at the bottom of Fore street. In 1974 the A38 road was opened linking Ivybridge to Plymouth and Exeter. It was the first major trunk road for Ivybridge and was bypassed at the B3213. The B3213 runs through the centre of Ivybridge and connects it to the nearby villages of Bittaford and Wrangaton. The first railway station at Ivybridge was not complete when the South Devon Railway was opened, but was brought into use six weeks later on 15 June 1848. The building was situated on the north side of the track, immediately to the west of Ivybridge Viaduct. Passenger trains were withdrawn on 2 March 1965. On 15 July 1994 a new station was opened on a new site costing £380,000 to the far east of the town. It is operated by First Great Western who run links to London Paddington, and from Exeter to Cornwall. It also has several trains that go to London Waterloo run by South West Trains.  The town has a bus service (X80) to Plymouth, Totnes and Torquay run by first First Devon and Cornwall. Stagecoach operates an hourly route between Plymouth and Paignton, which includes Ivybridge as a primary stop. Shopping. The shopping area is mainly along Fore Street, with some small shops and restaurants situated in the Glanvilles Mill shopping centre which is accessible from Fore Street. The shopping centre contains over 35 shops including Ivybridge's No.1 ranked restaurant ""The Riverbank"", Dame Hannah Rogers' charity shop, a post office, a hair salon, several estate agents and a Warrens Bakery. The town's closest superstore is a Tesco Extra in the neighbouring village of Lee Mill. There is also a ""Garden and Leisure"" outlet known as ""Endsleigh"" just outside the town. Education. The town has six schools: Four state primary schools, the Dame Hannah Roger's special school, and Ivybridge Community College, the town's secondary state school, which has a sixth form. It has specialist status as a sports college and has recently been given awards in science and mathematics as well as languages. The school has a very large catchment area which stretches from Shaugh Prior on Dartmoor, to Bigbury on the coast and covers many of the villages in the South Hams such as Ugborough, Modbury and Yealmpton. There are no independent schools in Ivybridge, but Dame Hannah Rogers School provides a boarding education for children with disabilities and communication needs. The nearest university is the University of Plymouth. The town also has a youth centre. In 2008 a new library and resource centre called the Watermark was opened, replacing the small library on Keaton Road . There are two notable people from the community college. One being sports teacher Michaela Breeze who won a gold medal weightlifting in the 2002 Commonwealth Games for Wales and won another gold medal in the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The other being the school's principal - Geoffrey Rees now retired, who was given a CBE at Buckingham Palace, London for his services to education. Religion. Ivybridge has six churches. St John's Church (Anglican) is the parish church situated near the Ivy Bridge. There is also a Baptist church, a Methodist church, and Ivybridge Congregational Church. On the western outskirts of the town is a Roman Catholic church — St Austin's Priory. The Salvation Army Church is currently held at Ivybridge Methodist Church, however it was formerly held in Chapel Place. In 2001, 78.55% of the population stated that they were Christian, 14.73% stated as no religion and 6.33% did not state their religion. Furthermore there were a few people stating other religions: 0.07 (9 people) as Muslim, 0.07% (8 people) stated as Buddhist, 0.05% (6 people) as Jewish, 0.02% (3 people) as Hindu, 0 as Sikh and 0.17 (21 people) as other religions. Sports. Each April the Ivybridge walking and outdoor festival takes place. There are various leisure facilities in the town: the South Dartmoor Leisure Centre features an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor swimming pool, an indoor sports hall, squash courts and gymnasium facilities. The South Devon Tennis Centre has four indoor and four outdoor courts. Next to the South Devon Tennis Centre are the Erme playing fields (Erme Valley) which hold a cricket field (with a practice net) and two football pitches. There is also a skatepark in the centre of the town and rugby pitches on the eastern outskirts of town at Ivybridge Rugby Football Club, a cricket team, and the Erme Valley Harriers (athletics and road running). The town's football team, called Ivybridge Town F.C., was founded in 1925 and play at region level in the South West Peninsula League. The town's flat green bowls club is situated at the end of Bridge Park. Public services. South West Water supply the town with water and sewage services. South Hams District Council is responsible for waste management. The town's Distribution Network Operator is Western Power Distribution. Currently the town along with the rest of Devon relies on electricity generated further north from the national grid, although Langage Power Station in Plympton is due to start generating electricity for the town as early as December 2008. The town has two health centres: Ivybridge Health Centre and Highlands health centre, both located near the centre of the town. It also has three dentist surgeries: Victoria House Dental Surgery, M L Brown and Highland Street Dental Practice. Ivybridge is served by Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and the nearest hospital is Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust operates in Ivybridge and the rest of the south west; its headquarters are in Exeter. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary serve the town's policing matters and there is a small police station in the centre of the town. Ivybridge has one retained fire station (number 53) on the southern outskirts of town, which is in the west division of Devon as part of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. It has a Water Tender Ladder, Prime Mover, Environmental Pod and an Incident Support Unit. The fire station used to be closer to the centre of the town. There is also a youth centre in the centre of the town which has just recently been was opened in 2007. "
wikipedia-386255," Peter Phillips  Peter Mark Andrew Phillips (born 15 November 1977) is the only son of Anne, Princess Royal, and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. He is the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Phillips holds no royal title or style and is currently 12th in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms. After graduating from university in 2000, he worked for Jaguar followed by WilliamsF1. In 2003, while working for WilliamsF1 in Canada, he met Autumn Kelly, whom he married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in 2008. Phillips keeps a low public profile and carries out no royal duties; for many years he has worked in the sports sponsorship and management fields. Early life and education. Peter Phillips was born at 10:46 am on 15 November 1977, at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington in west London. He was the first child of Mark Phillips and Princess Anne, who had married in 1973. His parents were said to have refused offers from the Queen that would have led to his being born in the peerage. Phillips was therefore the first legitimate grandchild of a monarch to be born without a title or courtesy style for more than 500 years. Before him the last grandchildren born without any title or style were the children of Cecily of York, the daughter of Edward IV. At birth he was fifth in line to the Throne, and remained so until Prince William's birth in 1982. At the time of his birth, there was a 41-gun salute from the Tower of London. He was baptised Peter Mark Andrew Phillips on 22 December 1977, by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace. His godparents were his uncle, the Prince of Wales, the Rt. Rev'd. Geoffrey Tiarks, Captain Hamish Lochore, Lady Cecil Cameron of Lochiel and Jane Holderness-Roddam. Princess Anne and Captain Phillips (who also had a daughter, Zara, in 1981) tried to ensure that their children were kept out of the limelight. Phillips has two half-sisters, Felicity Tonkin (born 1985), the daughter of Mark Phillips and his former mistress Heather Tonkin, and Stephanie Phillips (born 1997), the daughter of his father's second marriage to Sandy Pflueger. Peter Phillips went to Port Regis Prep School in Shaftesbury, Dorset before following other members of the Royal Family by attending Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. Whilst at Gordonstoun, he was chosen to be head boy and also played rugby for the school's team. Then he went to the University of Exeter and graduated with a degree in sports science. At university, he played for the Exeter University Rugby League team. Following the death of his aunt Diana, Princess of Wales, Peter Phillips was known to be very supportive of his cousin Prince William. Post-university. After his graduation in 2000, Phillips worked for Jaguar as corporate hospitality manager and then for WilliamsF1 racing team, where he was sponsorship accounts manager. In 2004, while working for WilliamsF1, Phillips was in a van in China with three other employees when the van was hit by a car. Phillips was uninjured. He left WilliamsF1 in September 2005, for a job as a manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. In March 2012, he left RBS to take on a role as managing director at SEL UK. Unlike his sister's personal life, Peter Phillips receives only limited publicity. He dated Elizabeth Lorio, a cod liver oil heiress from the United States, for two years; in 2001 they lived together for eight months. Later, he had a four-month relationship with Tara Swain, a flight attendant. In August 2012, it was announced that he would be the Guest of Honour at the 2012 Rugby League Challenge Cup Final between Warrington Wolves and Leeds Rhinos at Wembley on 24 August 2012. Marriage and children. In 2003, Phillips met Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. Their engagement was announced on 28 July 2007. The Queen gave her consent to the marriage in a meeting of her Privy Council on 9 April 2008. Before her marriage, Autumn Kelly converted from Roman Catholicism to the Church of England. If she had been Roman Catholic at the time of the marriage, Phillips would have lost his place in the line of the succession to the thrones because of the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701. Shortly before their wedding, the couple caused some reported unease in royal circles when they were interviewed and photographed by ""Hello!"" magazine, and were reported to have been paid £500,000. They married on 17 May 2008 at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The service was conducted by David Conner, the Dean of Windsor. The couple lived in Hong Kong after Phillips moved positions within the Royal Bank of Scotland to head their sponsorships activities in the region. They now live in London where he continues to work for the bank. Their first child, and the Queen's first great-grandchild, a daughter named Savannah Anne Kathleen, was born on 29 December 2010 at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. On Saturday, 23 April, the Queen was present for Savannah Phillips's baptism, which took place at Holy Cross Church in Avening, Gloucestershire, near Gatcombe Park, the home of his mother. Savannah is 13th in line for the throne. On 29 March 2012, Autumn gave birth to another daughter, Isla Elizabeth Phillips, who is 14th in line for the throne. "
wikipedia-386257," Operation Gold  Operation Gold (also known as Operation Stopwatch by the British) was a joint operation conducted by the American CIA and the British Secret Intelligence Service in the 1950s to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone. This was a much more complex variation of the earlier Operation Silver project in Vienna. Soviet authorities were informed about Operation Gold from the very beginning by their mole George Blake and ""discovered"" the tunnel in 1956. Overview. Although Operation Gold was planned by the SIS and the CIA, it was CIA money and manpower that carried it out . Details of the project are still classified, and whatever authoritative information can be found is scant. This is primarily because the then-Director of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles ordered ""as little as possible"" be ""reduced to writing"" when the project was authorized.  According to one account, Reinhard Gehlen, the head of the ""Bundesnachrichtendienst"", first alerted Dulles to the location of a crucial telephone junction, less than two meters (six feet) underground, where three cables came together close to the border of the American sector of West Berlin. British and U.S. intelligence officials met in London to plan the tunnel. One of those who attended those early meetings was George Blake, a mole in the British intelligence apparatus. Blake apparently alerted the KGB immediately, for two of Gehlen's agents were caught trying to get a potential tapping wire across a Berlin canal. The KGB decided to let Operation Gold go on since in order to attack the tunnel, the Soviets would have to compromise Blake and they found it preferable to sacrifice some information rather than their valuable agent. The KGB did not inform anyone in Germany, including the East Germans or the Soviet users of the cable lines, about the taps.  In December 1953 the operation was placed under the direction of William King Harvey, a former FBI official who transferred to the CIA. A warehouse with an unconventionally deep basement was specially constructed in the Rudow district of the American Sector of Berlin to serve as the staging area for the tunnel. The covert construction of a 450-metre (1,476-foot) tunnel 6 metres (~20 feet) under the world’s most heavily patrolled border to intersect a series of cable less than 47 cm (18"") below a busy street was an exceptional engineering challenge. Digging the initial vertical shaft for the tunnel began on 2 September, 1954 and was completed on 25 February the following year. The tunnel ran underneath Treptow/Altglienicke in the Soviet Sector from an electronic box for the tapping of the wires in Neukölln/Rudow in the American Sector. There the British and the Americans listened and recorded messages flowing to and from Soviet military headquarters in Zossen, near Berlin; conversations between Moscow and the Soviet embassy in East Berlin; and conversations between East German and Soviet officials. It appears the West was unable to break the Soviet encryption at this time. Instead they took advantage of a faint electronic echo produced by the Soviet communications equipment to read the traffic in plain text.  In Washington, DC, a team of CIA translators and analysts worked constantly on the vast amount of intercepts, ranging from high-level talk to barracks gossip. During the tunnel's brief lifespan of eleven months and eleven days, about half a million calls were recorded in 50,000 tapes. To evaluate this deluge the work of mining Operation Gold continued until September 1958. The KGB, forced to keep the flow of information as normal as possible, would occasionally let authentic sounding communications get through; the CIA may still have obtained some valuable information. When Blake received a transfer in 1955, the Soviets were free to ""discover"" the tunnel. On 21 April 1956, eleven months after the tunnel went into operation, Soviet and East German soldiers broke into the eastern end of the tunnel; calling it a ""breach of the norms of international law"" and ""a gangster act."" Newspapers around the world ran photographs of the underground partition of the tunnel directly under the inter-German frontier. The wall had a sign in German and Russian reading ""Entry is Forbidden by the Commanding General."" Not only was Allen Dulles affected by the tunnel raid, but also his brother John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and his sister Eleanor Lansing Dulles, the State Department's desk officer for Berlin. Only in 1961, when Blake was arrested, tried and convicted, did Western officials realize that the tunnel had been compromised long before construction had begun. Although Allen Dulles has publicly celebrated the success of Operation Gold, CIA analysts have argued about the overall worth of the intelligence that they had gathered. By one assessment, the Soviets had allowed ordinary military communications to flow through the cables to project the illusion that the Soviets had no aggressive intent against West Berlin. Operation Gold forms the background to the novels ""The Innocent"" by Ian McEwan and """" by T.H.E. Hill. "
wikipedia-386261," Joe Scarborough  Charles Joseph ""Joe"" Scarborough (; born April 9, 1963) is an American cable news and talk radio host, lawyer, author, and former politician. He is currently the host of ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC, and previously hosted ""Scarborough Country"" on the same channel. Scarborough served in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001 as a Republican from the 1st district of Florida. He was named in the 2011 ""Time"" 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. Early life, education and early legal career. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he is the son of George F. Scarborough, a businessman, and has two other siblings. When his father died in May 2011, his life story appeared in the ""Congressional Record"" and in ""Politico""'s Playbook. Scarborough even wrote a eulogy op-ed online. Joe Scarborough graduated from Pensacola Catholic High School in Pensacola, Florida. He received a B.A. from the University of Alabama in 1985 and a J.D. from the University of Florida College of Law in 1990. During this time he wrote and produced CDs with his band, Dixon Mills, and taught high school. He was admitted to the The Florida Bar in 1991, and practiced law in Pensacola. Scarborough's most famous case was representing Michael F. Griffin, the accused killer of abortion doctor David Gunn, in early to mid-1993. He made several court appearances for Griffin. ""There was 'no way in hell I could sit in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial,' he claims now, referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin."" Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing a trial lawyer from the many who offered their services, and he also shielded the family from the media exposure, pro bono.  Scarborough also helped to raise his political profile and made numerous contacts by assisting with a petition drive in late 1993 to oppose a 65 percent increase in the City of Pensacola's property taxes. Political career. Congress. In 1994, Scarborough won the Republican Party primary for Florida's 1st congressional district, which came open after eight-term Democratic incumbent Earl Hutto announced his retirement. In the general election he defeated the Democratic candidate, Pensacola attorney Vinnie Whibbs, with 61 percent of the vote. Whibbs was the son of well respected, former Pensacola mayor, Vince Whibbs. The win was not considered an upset, since the 1st was traditionally a conservative district. The district had not supported a Democratic candidate for U.S. president since 1960. While Democratic candidates continued to win most local offices well into the 1990s, they tended to be conservative even, by Southern Democratic standards. It had been widely believed that Hutto would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. . Scarborough was reelected with 72 percent of the vote in 1996. In 1998 and 2000, he was opposed by only a write-in candidate.. He received a 95 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union. He signed the Contract with America. Scarborough served on the Armed Services, Judiciary, Government Reform, and Education committees. In 1998, he was named Chairman of the Civil Service Committee.. Scarborough was one of a group of about 40 freshmen Republican legislators who dubbed themselves the ""New Federalists"" after the Federalist Papers. Scarborough was elected Political Director of the incoming legislators. The New Federalists called for sweeping cuts in the U.S. government, including plans to ""privatize, localize, consolidate, eliminate"" the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy and Housing and Urban Development, but were largely unsuccessful in their goals. Gingrich tapped Scarborough to head a Republican task force on education, and Scarborough declared, ""Our goal is to get as much money, power and authority out of Washington and get as much money, power and authority into the classroom as possible."" Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), then Chairman of the House Budget Committee, adopted Scarborough's language eliminating the federal Department of Education in the 1996 House Budget Resolution. That budget would pass the House by a vote of 238-193. Scarborough supported a number of pro-life positions while in Congress, including the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, that made it a crime to harm a fetus during the commission of other crimes, though he did not vote for the passage of the final bill. Scarborough sponsored a bill to force the U.S. to withdraw from the United Nations after a four-year transition and voted to make the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ""self-sufficient"" by eliminating federal funding. He also voted for the ""Medicare Preservation act of 1995,"" which cut the projected growth of Medicare by $270 billion over ten years, and against the ""Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996,"" which raised the minimum wage to $5.15. Scarborough had a conservative voting record on economic, social, and foreign policy issues, but was seen as moderate on environmental issues and human rights causes, including closing the School of the Americas and Lori Berenson. While in Congress, Scarborough received a number of awards, including the ""Friend of the Taxpayer Award"" from Americans for Tax Reform; the ""Guardian of Small Business Award"" from the National Federation of Independent Business; the ""Spirit of Enterprise Award"" from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the ""Taxpayer's Hero Award"" from the Citizens Against Government Waste; and the ""Guardian of Seniors' Rights Award"" from the 60 Plus Association. Resignation. Scarborough announced his intent to resign to spend more time with his children five months into his fourth term in Congress. ""The realization has come home to me that they're at a critical stage of their lives and I would rather be judged at the end of my life as a father than as a congressman,"" Scarborough said. A special election was held to replace him. Controversy. On July 20, 2001, one of Scarborough's aides died after hitting her head on a desk when she fainted while in Scarborough's Fort Walton Beach, Florida, office. According to Scarborough, soon after the death, allegations ""spread all over the Internet"" that he had been involved. There was no evidence of foul play. In 2003, he joked about the incident with Don Imus on Imus's radio program. In 2004, it was the subject of a public spat between Scarborough and filmmaker Michael Moore. Post-Congressional politics. After leaving Congress, he joined the law firm of prominent Florida attorney Fred Levin. He practiced law with the firm Beggs and Lane, the oldest firm in Florida. He was appointed to the President's Council on the 21st Century Workforce in 2002. In August 2005, Scarborough confirmed reports that he had been asked to consider a challenge to U.S. Rep. Katherine Harris for the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Bill Nelson's reelection bid. However, he announced later that month that he was renewing his contract with NBC. In July 2006, former aides to Harris's 2006 Senate campaign claimed that Harris had called potential Scarborough supporters and raised the death of an aide in his home district office as a means to prevent his entry into the race. Scarborough, who had never intended to enter the race, initially considered suing Harris but decided to let the incident pass. He later told Nelson that drawing Harris as an opponent in the race made Nelson ""the luckiest man in Washington."" In early 2009, Scarborough confirmed reports that he had been approached by Florida Republicans who wanted him to run for the Senate seat vacated by Republican Mel Martinez. Scarborough said he was not likely to run as he believes he can have more influence over public policy as the host of ""Morning Joe"" than as a U.S. Senator. However, he has not ruled out a political career in the future. In October 2010, Scarborough called former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich ""cartoonish"" and said that Gingrich engages in ""hate speech."" On a Meet The Press interview on January 21, 2013, Scarborough talked about how he believes that the GOP is getting smaller and going farther to the right with each election. He mentioned how many Republicans had already spoken out against their party and tried to push for the party to become more involved with mainstream issues. He also talked about how the GOP really did not win the house but only maintained it due to the use of gerrymandering."" Media career. Scarborough is the host of MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"", which features interviews with top newsmakers and politicians and analysis of the day’s biggest stories. Previously, he hosted ""Scarborough Country"", a primetime news show. He and Mika Brzezinski also briefly hosted a syndicated talk radio show called the ""Joe Scarborough Show"" on ABC Radio Network. While still serving in Congress, Scarborough founded the free weekly Pensacola-area newspaper ""The Florida Sun"" in 1999. The paper later merged in 2001 and is now known as the ""Independent News."" In April 2003, he embarked upon a television career with the launch of ""Scarborough Country"" on MSNBC, until he began hosting ""Morning Joe"" full-time. Scarborough briefly hosted a three-hour radio show in 2005. The show aired in a competitive time slot (10am–1pm US ET) and struggled to gain affiliates; those few that did carry the show usually carried it in the noon–3pm US ET slot or in late nights instead. After a few months, Scarborough left the show to focus his time on other priorities.  ""Morning Joe"". In May, 2007, Scarborough became one of the rotating hosts auditioning for the slot vacated by ""Imus in the Morning"" on MSNBC. Scarborough, with his morning show, won the slot permanently in July 2007. According to Nielsen Ratings, ""Morning Joe"" consistently beats CNN and Headline News in total viewers. Morning Joe has beaten CNN in total viewers every month since April 2011 and for 9 consecutive quarters. Morning Joe has also beaten Headline News in total viewers for 27 straight months. This is the first time in MSNBC history that its morning show has consistently out-rated both CNN and Headline News. Scarborough also is a regular guest on NBC news programs, MSNBC news programs, and has appeared on Meet the Press numerous times. In April 2012, Scarborough guest hosted Meet the Press.  On November 10, 2008, Scarborough made headlines when he said 'fuck' live on his show. In discussing Barack Obama's transition team, Scarborough contrasted the reputation of Clinton-era staffers with Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel by saying ""These were decent steady men who don't go around flipping people off or screaming 'fuck you' at the top of their lungs."" The comment was not bleeped out, and while Scarborough's guests and cohosts reacted with amusement, he continued with his point, apparently oblivious to what he had said, until co-host Mika Brzezinski broke in and informed him of his mistake. Scarborough apologized, saying that he thought he had only ""said the letter, not the word"" and commented that ""my wife's going to kill me.""  ""Morning Joe"" has subsequently been broadcast with a 7-second broadcast delay. MSNBC suspended Scarborough without pay for two days on November 19, 2010, for violating NBC News' policy against making contributions to political candidates without prior notification and approval, two weeks after NBC suspended then MSNBC host Keith Olbermann for the same offense. Scarborough had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. On July 23, 2012 Joe Scarborough speculated on The Morning Joe that James Eagan Holmes, the Aurora Colorado shooter suspect, could be on the autism spectrum. The National Autistic Advocacy Organization expressed ""deep concern"" over Scarborough's comment. Radio. On December 8, 2008, Scarborough and ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski began hosting a two-hour late-morning radio show on WABC (770 AM) in New York City, replacing 12-year veteran host John Gambling. As of April 26, 2010, the radio show has been put on ""hiatus"" to redevelop its format into a new three-hour show. Many, including Don Imus, have speculated that the show has actually been canceled by Citadel Media. It has been noted that the schedule of WABC would not allow for the program to be expanded an additional hour. Books. In his book ""The Last Best Hope"", released on June 9, 2009, Scarborough outlines a plan to help guide conservatives back to a political majority after their defeats in the 2006 midterm elections and the 2008 Presidential election.  He is also the author of ""Rome Wasn’t Burnt in a Day: the Real Deal on how Politicians, Bureaucrats, and other Washington Barbarians are Bankrupting America"".. Personal life. In 1986, Scarborough married Melanie Hinton. They had two sons, Joey and Andrew, and divorced in 1999. His younger child was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. While interviewing Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in June 2005, Scarborough expressed concerns about the possibility that one of his sons may have suffered vaccine damage, perhaps attributable to the sharp increase during the 1980s in the amount of thimerosal injected into infants: ""My son, born in 1991, has a slight form of autism called Asperger's. When I was practicing law and also when I was in Congress, parents would constantly come to me and they would bring me videotapes of their children, and they were all around the age of my son or younger. So, something happened in 1989."" In October 2001, Scarborough married Susan Waren, a former aide to Florida Governor Jeb Bush and a former congressional committee staffer. Their daughter Katherine was b. Aug.8, 2003. Their son Jack was b. May 2008. He has homes on the Upper West Side of New York City and in Pensacola, FL. Scarborough's love for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide football team and head coach, Nick Saban is well known to his viewers. He often talks about the Crimson Tide and will show video clips of Alabama games on his television show. His show has even been broadcast from the University's campus in Tuscaloosa on numerous occasions. On his January 10, 2012, telecast on MSNBC, the show's opening began with the playing of the famous Lynyrd Skynyrd song 'Sweet Home Alabama', as well as highlights of Alabama's 21-0 victory in the national title game over Louisiana State University from the previous evening.  Scarborough is an avid association football fan. As mentioned on ESPN's ""Off The Ball"" podcast, Scarborough details his dedication to Liverpool FC, a football team that competes in the English Premier League. "
wikipedia-386262," Peace of Callias  The Peace of Callias () is a purported treaty established around 449 BC between the Delian League (led by Athens) and Persia, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. The peace was agreed as the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid Persia and a Greek city.  The peace was negotiated by Callias, an Athenian politician. Persia had continually lost territory to the Greeks after the end of Xerxes I's invasion in 479 BC, and by 450 they were ready to make peace. The Peace of Callias gave autonomy to the Ionian states in Asia Minor, prohibited the establishment of Persian satrapies elsewhere on the Aegean coast, and prohibited Persian ships from the Aegean. Athens also agreed not to interfere with Persia's possessions in Asia Minor, Cyprus, Libya or Egypt (Athens had recently lost a fleet aiding an Egyptian revolt against Persia). Arguments for the existence of a peace treaty. Our knowledge of the Peace of Callias comes from references by the 4th century BC orators Isocrates and Demosthenes as well as the historian Diodorus. The ancient historian Theopompus deemed it a fabrication arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake – the lettering used hadn't come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purporting to have been agreed. It is possible that the treaty never officially existed, and if it was concluded, its importance is disputed. Thucydides did not mention it, but Herodotus says something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does Plutarch, who thought it had either been signed after the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, or that it had never been signed at all. In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Persia after 450/449, which allowed Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Greek states such as Corinth and Thebes, as well as Euboea which rebelled from the Delian League shortly after this. These conflicts may have arisen when Athenian 'allies' felt there was no longer a justification for the Delian League (which had developed from the Spartan-led Hellenic League that defeated Xerxes' invasion), as Persia was apparently no longer a threat. As Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the League became more of a true empire, and many of Athens' 'allies' began to rebel. Although Callias was also responsible for a peace (The Thirty Years' Peace) with Sparta in 446–445 BC, the growing Athenian threat would eventually lead to the Peloponnesian War. There was no direct fighting between the Greeks and the Persians after 450, but Persia continued to meddle in Greek affairs over the next twenty years, and was to become instrumental in securing a Spartan victory in the Peloponnesian War. Nonetheless, it remains a controversial topic among historians and scholars today. "
wikipedia-386274," Élie Cartan  Élie Joseph Cartan (; 9 April 1869 – 6 May 1951) was an influential French mathematician who did fundamental work in the theory of Lie groups and their geometric applications. He also made significant contributions to mathematical physics, differential geometry, and group theory. He was the father of another influential mathematician, Henri Cartan, and the composer Jean Cartan. Life. Élie Cartan was born in the village of Dolomieu, Isère, the son of a blacksmith. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly before studying at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1888 and obtaining his doctorate in 1894. He subsequently held lecturing positions in Montpellier and Lyon, becoming a professor in Nancy in 1903. He took a lecturing position at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1909, becoming professor there in 1912 until his retirement in 1940. He died in Paris after a long illness. Work. By his own account, in his ""Notice sur les travaux scientifiques"", the main theme of his works (numbering 186 and published throughout the period 1893–1947) was the theory of Lie groups. He began by working over the foundational material on the complex simple Lie algebras, tidying up the previous work by Friedrich Engel and Wilhelm Killing. This proved definitive, as far as the classification went, with the identification of the four main families and the five exceptional cases. He also introduced the algebraic group concept, which was not to be developed seriously before 1950. He defined the general notion of anti-symmetric differential form, in the style now used; his approach to Lie groups through the Maurer–Cartan equations required 2-forms for their statement. At that time what were called Pfaffian systems (i.e. first-order differential equations given as 1-forms) were in general use; by the introduction of fresh variables for derivatives, and extra forms, they allowed for the formulation of quite general PDE systems. Cartan added the exterior derivative, as an entirely geometric and coordinate-independent operation. It naturally leads to the need to discuss ""p""-forms, of general degree ""p"". Cartan writes of the influence on him of Charles Riquier’s general PDE theory. With these basics — Lie groups and differential forms — he went on to produce a very large body of work, and also some general techniques such as moving frames, that were gradually incorporated into the mathematical mainstream. In the ""Travaux"", he breaks down his work into 15 areas. Using modern terminology, they are these: External links. English translations of some of his books and articles: "
wikipedia-386300," John L. O'Sullivan  John Louis O'Sullivan (November 15, 1813 – March 24, 1895) was an American columnist and editor who used the term ""Manifest Destiny"" in 1845 to promote the annexation of Texas and the Oregon Country to the United States. O'Sullivan was an influential political writer and advocate for the Democratic Party at that time and served as US Minister to Portugal during the administration of President Franklin Pierce (1853–1857), but he largely faded from prominence soon thereafter. He was rescued from obscurity in the twentieth century after the famous phrase ""Manifest Destiny"" was traced back to him. ""Manifest Destiny"". In the July–August 1845 issue of the ""Democratic Review"", O'Sullivan published an essay entitled ""Annexation"", which called on the U.S. to admit the Republic of Texas into the Union. Because of concerns in the Senate over the expansion of the number of slave states and the possibility of war with Mexico, the annexation of Texas had long been a controversial issue. Congress had voted for annexation early in 1845, but Texas had yet to accept, and opponents were still hoping to block the annexation. O'Sullivan's essay urged that ""It is now time for the opposition to the Annexation of Texas to cease."" O'Sullivan argued that the United States had a divine mandate to expand throughout North America, writing of ""our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions."" Texas was annexed shortly thereafter, but O'Sullivan's first usage of the phrase ""Manifest Destiny"" attracted little attention. O'Sullivan's second use of the phrase became extremely influential. In a column, which appeared in the ""New York Morning News"" on December 27, 1845, O'Sullivan addressed the ongoing boundary dispute with Great Britain in the Oregon Country. And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us. That is, O'Sullivan believed that God (""Providence"") had given the United States a mission to spread republican democracy (""the great experiment of liberty"") throughout North America. Because Great Britain would not use Oregon for the purposes of spreading democracy, thought O'Sullivan, British claims to the territory could be disregarded. O'Sullivan believed that Manifest Destiny was a moral ideal (a ""higher law"") that superseded other considerations, including international laws and agreements. He made clear he did not include eastern Canada as part of the destiny, and worked to defuse tensions between the two countries in the 1840s.  O'Sullivan's original conception of Manifest Destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of U.S.-style democracy was inevitable, and would happen without military involvement as whites (or ""Anglo-Saxons"") emigrated to new regions. O'Sullivan disapproved of U.S. involvement the Mexican-American War in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries. O'Sullivan's phrase provided a label for sentiments which had become particularly popular during the 1840s, but the ideas themselves were not new. O'Sullivan himself had earlier expressed some of these ideas, notably in an 1839 essay entitled ""The Great Nation of Futurity"". O'Sullivan was not the originator of the concept of Manifest Destiny, but he was one of its foremost advocates. At first, O'Sullivan was not aware that he had created a new catch phrase. The term became popular after Whig opponents of the Polk administration criticized it. On January 3, 1846, Representative Robert Winthrop ridiculed the concept in Congress, saying ""I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation"". Despite this criticism, Democrats embraced the phrase. It caught on so quickly that it was forgotten that O'Sullivan had coined it. It was not until 1927 that historian Julius Pratt determined that the phrase had originated with O'Sullivan. Later years. O'Sullivan was at the peak of his fame and influence at the time of the ""Manifest Destiny"" articles. For example, at a Tammany Hall victory celebration on January 8, 1845, he proposed erecting a statue to the Democratic Party's founder and hero, Andrew Jackson. The monument that eventually emerged from his proposal was the famous equestrian statue of Jackson in Lafayette Square, across from the White House, which was dedicated in 1853. Financial troubles abruptly brought an end to his editorial career. The ""New York Morning News"" was losing money, and in May 1846, the paper's investors fired O'Sullivan. The new management was unable to turn things around, and the paper ceased publication in September. Around the same time, O'Sullivan sold the ""Democratic Review"", although he would still occasionally write for the magazine. Now thirty-two years old, he began looking for new opportunities. O'Sullivan married Susan Kearny Rodgers on October 21, 1846. The couple went to Cuba for their honeymoon, where one of O'Sullivan's sisters lived. O'Sullivan thereafter became involved in a movement to win Cuban independence from Spanish rule. Composed of Cuban dissidents and American ""filibusters"", the movement hoped to have Cuba annexed to the United States. On May 10, 1848, O'Sullivan had the first of several meetings with President Polk to try to convince the president to buy Cuba from Spain. Polk offered Spain one hundred million dollars for Cuba—the amount suggested by O'Sullivan—but the offer was declined. O'Sullivan continued to work for Cuban independence, raising money for the failed filibustering expedition of Narciso López. As a result, O'Sullivan was charged in federal court in New York with violation of the Neutrality Act. His trial in March 1852 ended in a hung jury. Although O'Sullivan's reputation was tarnished, he was appointed by the Pierce administration as the U.S. Minister to Portugal, serving from 1854 to 1858. This proved to be his last steady employment; he and his wife would spend the rest of their lives on the edge of poverty. O'Sullivan opposed the coming of the American Civil War, hoping that a peaceful solution—or a peaceful separation of North and South—could be worked out. In Europe when the war began, O'Sullivan became an active supporter of the Confederate States of America; he may have been on the Confederate payroll at some point. O'Sullivan wrote a number of pamphlets promoting the Confederate cause, arguing that the presidency had become too powerful and that states' rights needed to be protected against encroachment by the central government. Although he had earlier supported the ""free soil"" movement, he now defended the institution of slavery, writing that blacks and whites could not live together in harmony without it. His activities greatly disappointed some of his old friends, including Hawthorne. After the war, he spent several more years in self-imposed exile in Europe O'Sullivan returned to New York in the late 1870s, where he unsuccessfully tried to use his Democratic contacts to get appointed to some office. His political life, however, was over. After the death of his mother, he became a believer in Spiritualism, then a popular religious movement, and claimed to have used the services of one of the Fox sisters to communicate with the spirits of people such as William Shakespeare. O'Sullivan suffered a stroke in 1889. He died in obscurity from influenza in a residential hotel in New York City in 1895, just as the phrase ""Manifest Destiny"" was being revived. He is buried in the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island. "
wikipedia-386302," Russian cruiser Aurora  Aurora () is a 1900 Russian protected cruiser, currently preserved as a museum ship in St. Petersburg. She battled the Japanese Navy in the Russo-Japanese War. One of the first incidents of the October Revolution in Russia took place on the cruiser ""Aurora"". Russo-Japanese War. ""Aurora"" was one of three ""Pallada""-class cruisers, built in St. Petersburg for service in the Pacific Far East. All three ships of this class served during the Russo-Japanese War. The second ship, ""Pallada"", was sunk by the Japanese at Port Arthur in 1904. The third ship, ""Diana"", was interned in Saigon after the Battle of the Yellow Sea. ""Aurora"" was part of the Russian 2nd Pacific Squadron formed mostly from the Russian Baltic Fleet, which was sent from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific, under the command of Vice-Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. On the way to the Far East, she sustained light damage from confused friendly fire in the Dogger Bank incident. On 27 and 28 May 1905, ""Aurora"" took part in the Battle of Tsushima, along with the rest of the Russian squadron. During the battle, the wounded Senior officer of the ship, Captain of 2nd rank Arkadiy Konstantinovich Nebolsine took command of the cruiser. After that ""Aurora"", covering other, much slower Russian vessels, under the command of Rear-Admiral Oskar Enkvist, with two other Russian cruisers broke through to neutral Manila, where she was interned. In 1906, ""Aurora"" returned to the Baltic and became a cadet training ship. From 1906 until 1912 the cruiser visited a number of other countries; in November 1911 the ship was in Bangkok as part of the celebrations in honour of the coronation of the new King of Siam. October Revolution. During the First World War the ship operated in the Baltic Sea. In 1915, her armament was changed to fourteen 152 mm (6 in) guns. At the end of 1916, the ship was moved to Petrograd (the renamed St Petersburg) for a major repair. The city was brimming with revolutionary ferment and part of her crew joined the 1917 February Revolution. A revolutionary committee was created on the ship, with Aleksandr Belyshev elected as its captain. Most of the crew joined the Bolsheviks, who were preparing for a Communist revolution. According to the Soviet account of history, on 25 October 1917, ""Aurora"" refused to carry out an order to put to sea, which sparked the October Revolution. At 9.45 p.m on that date, a blank shot from her forecastle gun signaled the start of the assault on the Winter Palace, which was to be the last episode of the October Revolution. The cruiser's crew allegedly took part in that attack. Second World War. In 1922, ""Aurora"" was brought to service again as a training ship. During the Second World War, the guns were taken from the ship and used in the land defence of Leningrad. The ship herself was docked in Oranienbaum port, and was repeatedly shelled and bombed. On 30 September 1941 she was damaged and sunk in the harbour. After extensive repairs in 1945 - 1947, ""Aurora"" was permanently anchored on the Neva in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) as a monument to the Great October Socialist Revolution and in 1957 became a museum-ship. On 2 November 1927, ""Aurora"" was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for her revolutionary merits and on 22 February 1968 the Order of the October Revolution. The latter features the image of the cruiser herself. To the present. As a museum ship, the cruiser ""Aurora"" became one of the many tourist attractions of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and continued to be a symbol of the October Socialist Revolution and a prominent attribute of Russian history. In addition to the museum space, a part of the ship continued to house a naval crew whose duties included caring for the ship, providing security and participating in government and military ceremonies. The crew was considered to be on active duty and was subject to military training and laws. Having long served as a museum ship, from 1984 to 1987 the cruiser was once again placed in her construction yard, the Admiralty Shipyard, for capital restoration. During the overhaul, due to deterioration, the ship's hull below the waterline was replaced with a new welded hull according to the original drawings. The cut off lower hull section was towed into the Gulf of Finland, to the unfinished base at Ruchi, and sunk near the shore. The restoration revealed that some of the ship parts, including the armour plates, were originally made in England, which put in doubt the previously maintained image of the cruiser as a marvel of authentic Russian naval engineering. ""Aurora"" stands today as the oldest commissioned ship of the Russian Navy, still flying the naval ensign under which she was commissioned, but now under the care of the Central Naval Museum. She is still manned by an active service crew commanded by a Captain of the 1st Rank. From 1956 to the present day 28 million people have visited the cruiser ""Aurora"". In January, 2013, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced plans to recommission Aurora and make it the symbol of the Russian Navy due to its historical and cultural importance. "

He is best known for his roles as John Bender in ""The Breakfast Club"", Alec Newbary in ""St. Elmo's Fire"", Hot Rod and Rodimus Prime in """" and Jack Richmond in ""Suddenly Susan"". Early life. Nelson was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Merle (née Royte), a court mediator and former member of the Maine state legislature, and Leonard Nelson, a corporate lawyer. His family was Jewish, and his father was the first Jewish president of the Portland Symphony Orchestra. He has two sisters, Eve and Julie. He went to school at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, and studied at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, leaving during his sophomore year. He subsequently moved to Manhattan to study acting with Stella Adler. Career. 1980s. Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in ""Making the Grade"" (1984) and ""Fandango"" (1985), the latter in which he starred opposite a young Kevin Costner. It was his roles in John Hughes's ""The Breakfast Club"" and Joel Schumacher's ""St. Elmo's Fire"" - and his affiliation with the Brat Pack - that made Nelson a star (along with Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy). The ""St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"" music video - also directed by Joel Schumacher - reached #1 in the USA (1985) and was written and performed by John Parr; Nelson appears in the video. A subsequent article in ""New York"" magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term ""Brat Pack"" being coined. In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in ' and teamed up with ""Breakfast Club"" alumna Ally Sheedy for a third time in ""Blue City"". He also provided narration for Bill Couturie's ', a critically acclaimed war documentary that featured a cast including Tom Berenger, Robert De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Matt Dillon. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the documentary, and it maintains a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 1987 saw him starring in the Bob Clark courtroom comedy ""From the Hip"", which co-starred John Hurt and Elizabeth Perkins; he also provided a stand-out performance in ""Billionaire Boys Club (film)"", a courtroom thriller based on actual events.

wikipedia-386327," Law School Admission Test  The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is a half-day standardized test administered four times each year at designated testing centers throughout the world. Administered by the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) for prospective law school candidates, the LSAT is designed to assess reading comprehension, logical, and verbal reasoning proficiencies. The test is an integral part of the law school admission process in the United States, Canada (common law programs only), the University of Melbourne, Australia, and a growing number of other countries. An applicant cannot take the LSAT more than three times within a two-year period.  The test has existed in some form since 1948, when it was created to give law schools a standardized way to assess applicants aside from GPA . The current form of the exam has been used since 1991. The exam has six total sections: four scored multiple choice sections, an unscored experimental section, and an unscored writing section. Raw scores are converted to a scaled score with a high of 180, a low of 120, and a median score around 150. When an applicant applies to a law school, all scores from the past five years are reported. As of August 2013, it costs $165 (USD) to take the LSAT in the United States, and $164 (CAD) in Canada. History. The LSAT was the result of a 1945 inquiry of Frank Bowles, a Columbia Law School admissions director, about a more satisfactory admissions test that could be used for admissions than the one that was in use in 1945. The goal was to find a test that would correlate with first year grades rather than bar passage rates. This led to an invitation of representatives from Harvard Law School and Yale Law School who ultimately accepted the invitation and began to draft the first administration of the LSAT exam. NYU, in correspondence by memorandum, was openly unconvinced ""about the usefulness of an aptitude test as a method of selecting law school students"", but was open to experimenting with the idea, as were other schools that were unconvinced. At a meeting on November 10, 1947, with representatives of law schools extending beyond the original Columbia, Harvard, and Yale representatives, the design of the LSAT was discussed. Interestingly, at this meeting the issue of a way to test students who came from excessively ""technical"" backgrounds that were deficient in the study of history and literature was discussed but ultimately rejected. The first administration of the LSAT followed and occurred in 1948. Administration. LSAC administers the LSAT four times per year: June, September/October, December, and February. The June examination marks the start of a new ""cycle"" of testing as most test-takers plan to apply for admission the following year. The September/October administration is typically the most popular with the February administration being the least popular. 129,925 LSATs were administered in the 2011–12 testing year (June 2011–February 2012), the largest percentage decline in LSATs administered in more than 10 years, and a drop of more than 16% from the previous year, when 155,050 LSATs were administered. The number of LSATs administered fell more than 25% over a two-year period (from the 2009–10 testing year to the 2011–12 testing year). The October 2012 administration reflected a 16.4% drop in volume from its 2011 counterpart. Test composition. The LSAT consists of five 35-minute multiple choice sections (one of which is an unscored experimental section) followed by an unscored writing sample section. Modern tests have 99–102 scored items in total. Several different test forms are used within an administration, each presenting the multiple choice sections in different orders, which is intended to make it difficult to cheat or to guess which is the experimental section. Logical reasoning. The LSAT contains two logical reasoning (""LR"") sections, commonly known as ""arguments"", designed to test the taker's ability to dissect and analyze arguments. LR sections each contain 24–26 questions. Each question begins with a short argument or set of facts. This is followed by a prompt asking the test taker to find the argument's assumption, to select an alternate conclusion to the argument, to identify errors or logical omissions in the argument, to find another argument with parallel reasoning, or to choose a statement that would weaken/strengthen the argument. Passages are currently followed by a single prompt. Though in older tests (pre -2007) a few questions were followed by two prompts. Reading comprehension. The LSAT contains one reading comprehension (""RC"") section consisting of four passages of 400–500 words, and 5–8 questions relating to each passage. Complete sections contain 26–28 questions. Though no real rules govern the content of this section, the passages generally relate to law, arts and humanities, physical sciences, or social sciences. The questions usually ask the examinee to determine the author's main idea, find specific information in the passage, draw inferences from the text, and/or describe the structure of the passage. In June 2007, one of the four passages was replaced with a ""comparative reading"" question. Comparative reading presents two shorter passages with differing perspectives on a topic. Parallels exist between the comparative reading question, the SAT's critical reading section, and the science section of the ACT. Analytical reasoning. The current LSAT contains one analytical reasoning section, which is referred to colloquially as the ""logic games (LG)"" section. One section contains four ""games"" falling into a number of categories including grouping, matching, and ordering of elements.  Each LG section has 22–24 questions. Each game begins by outlining the premise (""there are five people who might attend this afternoon's meeting"") and establishing a set of conditions governing the relationships among the subjects (""if Amy is present, then Bob is not present; if Cathy is present, then Dan is present...""). The examinee is then asked to draw conclusions from the statements (""What is the maximum number of people who could be present?""). What makes the games challenging is that the rules do not produce a ""single"" ""correct"" set of relationships among all elements of the game; rather, the examinee is tested on their ability to analyze the range of possibilities embedded in a set of rules. Individual questions often add rules or modify existing rules, requiring quick reorganization of known information. Unscored Variable section. The current test contains one experimental section which Law Services refers to as the ""Variable section"". It is used to test new questions for future exams. The performance of the examinee on this section is not reported as part of the final score. The examinee is not told which section of the exam is experimental, since doing so could skew the data. Previously, this section has always been one of the first three sections of any given test, but beginning with the administration of the October 2011 LSAT the experimental can be after the first three sections. LSAC makes no specific claim as to what section(s) it has appeared as in the past, and what section(s) it may appear as in the future. Writing sample. The writing sample appears as the final section of the exam. The writing sample is presented in the form of a decision prompt, which provides the examinee with a problem and two criteria for making a decision. The examinee must then write an essay favoring one of the two options over the other. The decision prompt generally does not involve a controversial subject, but rather something mundane about which the examinee likely has no strong bias. While there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer to the writing prompt, it is important that the examinee argues for his/her chosen position and also argues against the counter-position.  LSAC does not score the writing sample. Instead, the essay is digitally imaged and sent to admission offices along with the LSAT score. Between the quality of the handwriting and of the digital image, some admissions officers regard the readability and usefulness of the writing sample to be marginal. Additionally, most schools require that applicants submit a ""personal statement"" of some kind. These factors sometimes result in admission boards disregarding the writing sample. However, only 6.8% of 157 schools surveyed by LSAC in 2006 indicated that they ""never"" use the writing sample when evaluating an application. In contrast, 9.9% of the schools reported that they ""always"" use the sample; 25.3% reported that they ""frequently"" use the sample; 32.7% responded ""occasionally""; and 25.3% reported ""seldom"" using the sample. Preparation. LSAC recommends advance preparation for the LSAT, due to the importance of the LSAT in law school admissions and because scores on the exam typically correspond to preparation time. The structure of the LSAT and the types of questions asked are generally consistent from year to year, which allows students to practice on question types that show up frequently in examinations. LSAC suggests, at a minimum, that students review official practice tests before test day to familiarize themselves with the types of questions that appear on the exams. LSAC offers one free test that can be downloaded from their website. For best results, LSAC suggests taking practice tests under actual time constraints and conditions in order to identify problem areas to focus on for further review. For preparation purposes, only tests after June 1991 are considered modern, since the LSAT was significantly modified after this date. Each released exam is commonly referred to as a PrepTest. The June 1991 LSAT was numbered as PrepTest 1, and the October 2012 LSAT was PrepTest 67. Certain PrepTests are no longer published by LSAC (among them 1–6, 8, 17, 39, and 40), despite the fact that they were in print at one time. However, these tests have been made available through some of the test preparation companies. Some students taking the LSAT use a test preparation company. Students who do not use these courses often rely on material from university text books, LSAT preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources. Scoring. The LSAT is a standardized test in that LSAC adjusts raw scores to fit an expected norm to overcome the likelihood that some administrations may be more difficult than others. Normalized scores are distributed on a scale with a low of 120 to a high of 180. The LSAT system of scoring is predetermined and does not reflect test takers' percentile, unlike the SAT. The relationship between raw questions answered correctly (the ""raw score"") and scaled score is determined before the test is administered, through a process called equating. This means that the conversion standard is set beforehand, and the distribution of percentiles can vary during the scoring of any particular LSAT.  Adjusted scores resemble a bell curve, tapering off at the extremes and concentrating near the median. For example, there might be a 3–5 question difference between a score of 175 and a score of 180, but the difference between a 155 from a 160 could be 9 or more questions. Although the exact percentile of a given score will vary slightly between examinations, there tends to be little variance. The 50th percentile is typically a score of about 151; the 90th percentile is around 165 and the 99th is about 173. A 178 or better usually places the examinee in the 99.9th percentile. Examinees have the option of canceling their scores within six calendar days after the exam, before they get their scores. LSAC still reports to law schools that the student registered for and took the exam, but releases no score. Test takers typically receive their scores by e-mail between three and four weeks after the exam. There is a formal appeals process for examinee complaints, which has been used for proctor misconduct, peer misconduct, and occasionally for challenging a question. In very rare instances, specific questions have been omitted from final scoring. University of North Texas economist Michael Nieswiadomy has conducted several studies (in 1998, 2006, and 2008) derived from LSAC data. In the most recent study Nieswiadomy took the LSAC's categorization of test-takers into 162 majors and grouped these into 29 categories, finding the averages of each major:  Use of scores in law school admissions. The LSAT is considered an important part of the law school admissions process, along with GPA. Many law schools are selective in their decisions to admit students, and the LSAT is one method of differentiating candidates. Additionally the LSAC says the LSAT (like the SAT and ACT at the undergraduate level) serves as a standardized measure of one's ability to succeed during law school. Undergraduate grade points can vary significantly due to choices in course load as well as grade inflation, which may be pervasive at an applicant's undergraduate institution, but almost nonexistent at that of another. Some law schools, such as Georgetown University and the University Of Michigan have added programs designed to waive the LSAT for selected students who have maintained a 3.8 undergraduate GPA at their schools.  LSAC says its own research supports the use of the LSAT as a major factor in admissions, saying the median validity for LSAT alone is .41 (2001) and .40 (2002) in regards to the first year of law school. The correlation varies from school to school, and LSAC says that test scores are strongly correlated to first year law school performance than undergraduate GPA. LSAC says that a more strongly correlated single-factor measure does not currently exist, that GPA is difficult to use because it is influenced by the school and the courses taken by the student, and that the LSAT can serve as a yardstick of student ability because it is statistically normed. In 2011 it was reported that the American Bar Association was considering a recommendation to end the requirement for law schools to use the LSAT as an admission requirement, as emphasis on LSAT scores is considered by some to be detrimental to the promotion of diversity among applicants.  Most admission boards use an admission index, which is a formula that applies different weight to the LSAT and undergraduate GPA and adds the results. This composite statistic can have a stronger correlation to first year performance than either GPA or LSAT score alone, depending on the weighting used. The amount of weight assigned to LSAT score versus undergraduate GPA varies from school to school, as almost all law programs employ a different admission index formula. Multiple scores. Students may take the test only three times in a two-year period unless they are granted an exemption from LSAC. Every score within five years is reported to law schools during the application process, as well a separate average of all scores on record. For admission determination, many law schools use the highest score on record, some use the average score, and some use the highest score if the difference between the highest and lowest score is at or greater than a certain number. How the law schools report the LSAT scores of their matriculants to the American Bar Association (ABA) has changed over the years. In June 2006, the ABA revised a rule that mandated law schools to report their matriculants' average score if more than one test was taken. The current ABA rule now requires law schools to report only the highest LSAT score for matriculants who took the test more than once. In response, many law schools began considering only the highest LSAT score during the admissions process, as the highest score is an important factor in law school rankings such as those published by US News and World Report. Fingerprinting controversy. Starting October 1973, those taking the LSAT were required to have fingerprints taken, after some examinees were found to have hired impostors to take the test on their behalf. A recent controversy surrounding the LSAT was the requirement that examinees submit to fingerprinting on the day of testing. Although LSAC does not store digital representations of fingerprints, there is a concern that fingerprints might be accessible by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. At the behest of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the LSAC implemented a change as of September 2007 which exempts Canadian test takers from the requirement to provide a fingerprint and instead requires that Canadian test-takers provide a photograph. Starting with the June 2011 admission of the LSAT, LSAC expanded this policy to include test-takers in the United States and Caribbean; LSAC therefore no longer requires fingerprints from any test takers.

wikipedia-386329," Ira D. Sankey  Ira David Sankey (August 28, 1840 – August 13, 1908), known as ""The Sweet Singer of Methodism,"" was an American gospel singer and composer, associated with evangelist Dwight L. Moody.  Biography. Ira David Sankey, son of David Sankey, known as the father of Lawrence County, and Mary Leeper Sankey, was born August 28, 1840, in Edinburg, on the outskirts of New Castle, Pennsylvania. When Sankey was 16, he was converted at a revival meeting at the King's Chapel United Methodist Church, which was about three miles away from his home. When he was young, Sankey served in the Civil War. Afterward, he took employment at the IRS, and also the YMCA. He became increasingly well known as a Gospel singer, and eventually attracted the attention of noted evangelist Dwight L. Moody. The two men met at a YMCA convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, in June, 1870. Several months later, Sankey attended his first evangelistic meeting with Moody. Shortly thereafter, Sankey resigned his government position. Sankey married Fanny V. Edwards, one of his choir members, in September 1863. They had three sons. In October 1871, Sankey and Moody were in the middle of a revival meeting when the Great Chicago Fire broke out. The two men barely escaped the conflagration with their lives. Sankey ended up watching the city burn from a rowboat far out on Lake Michigan. On June 7, 1872, Sankey and Moody made the first of several joint visits to the UK. Sankey's hymns were promoted by the famous London Baptist preacher, Charles Spurgeon, long afterwards. While in Edinburgh, they raised £10,000 for the purpose of building a new home for the Carrubbers Close Mission. During their time in Edinburgh, the foundation stone was laid and the building remains one of the few on the Royal Mile which today serves the same purpose for which it was built. When Rev. Moody was asked by a local pastor what he felt was the primary contribution that a gospel singer and song leader such as Ira Sankey brought to his meetings he replied, ""If we can only get people to have the words of the Love of God coming from their mouths it's well on its way to residing in their hearts."" Sankey wrote several hymns and songs, and composed and arranged music for many more. He collaborated with Philip Bliss and then later with James McGranahan and George Stebbins) on a series of ""sacred song"" collections published in the United States by Biglow & Main (a company of which he was president from 1895 to 1908), and in the United Kingdom by Morgan & Scott, publishers also of his most enduring work, the popular ""Sacred Songs and Solos"" (widely known as ""Sankey & Moody"") which eventually ran to over 1200 works and is still in use today. He was blind from glaucoma the last five years of his life, and no doubt found a kindred spirit in his friend and music-making partner, blind hymnodist Fanny Crosby. Stories of his hymn compositions seem a fitting way to conclude this biography. His first and most famous composition was 'The Ninety and Nine'. Sankey and Moody were en route from Glasgow to Edinburgh, Scotland, in May, 1874, as they were to hold a three-day campaign there. This was at the urgent request of the Ministerial Association. Prior to boarding the train, Sankey bought a weekly newspaper for a penny. He found nothing of interest but a sermon by Henry W. Beecher and some advertisements. Then, he found a little piece of poetry in a corner of one column that he liked, and he read it to Moody, but only received a polite reply. Sankey clipped the poem and tucked it in his pocket. At the noon day service of the second day of the special series, Moody preached on The Good Shepherd. Horatius Bonar added a few thrilling words and then Moody asked Mr. Sankey if he had a final song. An inner voice prompted him to sing the hymn that he found on the train. With conflict of spirit, he thought, this is impossible! The inner voice continued to prod him, even though there was no music to the poem, so he acquiesced. As calmly as if he had sung it a thousand times, he placed the little piece of newspaper on the organ in front of him. Lifting up his heart in a brief prayer to Almighty God, he then laid his hands on the keyboard, striking a chord in A flat. Half speaking and half singing, he completed the first stanza, which was followed by four more. Moody walked over with tears in his eyes and said, ""Where did you get that hymn?"" 'The Ninety and Nine' became his most famous tune and his most famous sale from that time on. The words were written by Elizabeth Clephane in 1868. She died in 1869, little realizing her contribution to the Christian world.  Ira D. Sankey died August 13, 1908 in Brooklyn. Legacy. In 1979–1980, the Gospel Music Association recognized Sankey's prodigious contributions to gospel music by listing him in the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. "
wikipedia-386347," Anti-folk  Anti-folk (sometimes antifolk or unfolk) is a music genre that takes the earnestness of politically charged 1960s folk music and subverts it. The defining characteristics of this anti-folk are difficult to identify, as they vary from one artist to the next. Nonetheless, the music tends to sound raw or experimental; it also generally mocks seriousness and pretension in the established mainstream music scene. History. Anti-folk in the US. Anti-folk was begun by artists unable to gain gigs at established folk venues in Greenwich Village, including Folk City and The Speakeasy. Soon after, singer-songwriter Lach started The Fort, an after-hours club, on the Lower East Side, after a booker at Folk City told him his music was ""too punk"". The Fort's opening coincided with the New York Folk Festival, so Lach dubbed his own event the New York Antifolk Festival. Other early proponents of the movement included Cindy Lee Berryhill, Brenda Kahn, Paleface, Beck, Michelle Shocked, Zane Campbell, and John S. Hall. Roger Manning, Kirk Kelly, Sander Hicks, and Block were also early anti-folk artists. The original Fort was shut down in 1985, and the club moved from location to location, including East Village bars Sophie's and Chameleon, before winding up in the back room of the SideWalk Cafe from 1993. The New York Antifolk Festival continues to be held annually at the SideWalk Cafe (long outlasting the original Folk Festival). Events have also taken place in the band shells in Tompkins Square Park and Central Park. While living in San Francisco for a few years in the early 1990s, Lach helped establish a West Coast anti-folk movement at the Sacred Ground club. Anti-folk in the UK. In the 2000s (decade), the label has been adopted in Britain, particularly in the London underground scene, with acts including David Cronenberg's Wife and The Bobby McGee's. The UK anti-folk scene (largely centred in London and Brighton) has established its own identity, which has been written about in a six-page feature in the September 2007 issue of ""Plan B"" magazine. ""Plan B"" held an anti-folk night at the Huw Stevens-curated Sŵn in Cardiff in November 2007. The beginnings of the UK anti-folk scene were in London, with shows promoted by Sergeant Buzfuz that, although not billed as anti-folk, featured many U.S. and UK anti-folk singer/songwriters. In 2004, the lo-fi musician Filthy Pedro started seasonal anti-folk festivals, which he promoted with Tom Mayne of the band David Cronenberg's Wife. The Brighton anti-folk scene was quick to follow, curated primarily by Mertle. Other key figures within the UK anti-folk community include Dan Treacy of Television Personalities, Jack Hayter, Milk Kan, Extradition Order, Benjamin Shaw, Grelch, Royal Mugs, Larry Pickleman and Paul Hawkins. Emmy the Great is loosely connected with the English anti-folk scene, having played at Sgt Buzfuz's nights in 2003 as part of the duo Contraband. Kate Nash started her music career playing anti-folk-style shows, including a concert promoted by Larry Pickleman and Mertle in Brighton. Laura Marling is sometimes linked with anti-folk, although this is less to do with the UK movement and more to do with her perceived musical style. Anti-folk-influenced acts such as The Bobby McGee's have begun to pick up regular national radio airplay and media coverage. In August 2006, ""Timeout Magazine"" called anti-folk ""One of London's hottest subcultures"". The first anti-folk UK compilation album, ""Up the Anti"", was released in 2007, mastered by Mark Kramer. The Welsh anti-folk artist Mr Duke has gained some popularity in Wales. "
wikipedia-386362," Rotherham United F.C.  Rotherham United Football Club, nicknamed The Millers, is an English professional football club based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, that competes in League One, the third tier of English football. The club's colours have traditionally been red and white, although these have evolved through history. The kits are designed by Puma. The current home strip is red and white; with the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham's coat of arms on the right of the shirt to commemorate the clubs return home, and their away kit is Grey. The club play its home games at New York Stadium, having played for more than a century at Millmoor. The club has spent the majority of its history in the Football League's third tier, though its most successful period in recent years found the Millers competing in the Football League Championship during the early 2000s. It has also enjoyed more recent success, reaching the League Two Play Off Finals at Wembley Stadium in May 2010, and gaining automatic promotion after finishing runners-up in Football League Two in 2012/13. History. The club's roots go back to 1870, when the club was formed as Thornhill Football Club (later Thornhill United). George Cook was the trainer around this time. For many years the leading team in the area was Rotherham Town F.C., who spent three seasons in the Football League while Thornhill United were still playing in the Sheffield & Hallamshire League. By the turn of the century, however, Rotherham Town had resigned from the Football League and gone out of business; a new club of the same name later joined the Midland League. Meanwhile, Thornhill's fortunes were on the rise to the extent that in 1905 they laid claim to being the pre-eminent club in the town and changed their name to Rotherham County. For a period both clubs competed in the Midland League, finishing first and second in 1911–12. Over time it became clear that to have two professional clubs in the town was not sustainable. Talks had begun in February 1925 and in early May the two clubs merged to form Rotherham United. Days later the reformed club was formally re-elected under its new name. The red and white was adopted around 1928 after playing in amber and black, but there was no improvement in the club's fortunes: in 1931 they again had to apply for re-election. Immediately after the Second World War things looked up. United finished as runners-up three time in succession between 1947 and 1949 and then were champions of Division Three (North) in 1951. Rotherham reached their highest ever league position of third in the Football League Second Division in 1955, when only goal average denied them a place in the top flight after they finished level on points with champions Birmingham City and runners-up Luton Town. The club held on to its place in Division Two until 1968 and then went into a decline that took them down to Division Four in 1973. In 1975 they were promoted back to the Third Division winning the championship. The Millers won the Division Three title in 1981. Rotherham had a dismal first half of the 1981–82 season but a surge after the turn of 1982 saw them emerge as promotion contenders for the first time in nearly 30 years. This was the first season of 3 points for a win rather than 2 in the league, and in the end they missed out on promotion by 4 points and finishing seventh. They have not finished this high ever since. During the 1990s Rotherham were promoted and relegated between the Football League's lowest two divisions and they slipped into the Fourth Division in 1991, just two years after being promoted, but reclaimed their status in the third tier (renamed Division Two for the 1992–93 season due to the launch of the FA Premier League) by finished third in the Fourth Division in 1992. They survived at this level for five years, never looking like promotion contenders, before being relegated in 1997. In 1996 Rotherham United made their first trip to Wembley, beating Shrewsbury 2–1 to win the Football League Trophy, with two goals from Nigel Jemson giving Rotherham the win, with over 20,000 Rotherham United fans following them. In 1997, just after relegation to Division Three, Ronnie Moore took charge of Rotherham United. His first season ended in a mid-table finish and then his second in a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to Leyton Orient. It was third time lucky in 1999–2000 as Rotherham finished as Division Three runners-up and gained promotion to Division Two. They were favourites to be relegated in 2000–01 season, but surprised many by finishing runners-up in Division Two and gaining a second successive promotion. Famously, the Millers beat Brentford 2–1 at a sold-out Millmoor Stadium, with Alan Lee scoring the winner, sealing promotion. During this successful campaign, Rotherham also beat Premiership side Southampton in the FA Cup. Rotherham managed to remained in Division One for four seasons, the most successful of which was the 2002–03 campaign. The Millers were in contention for a play-off place, but dropped off near the season's end to finish 15th, their lowest position all season. During their time in the Championship they managed some notable victories including two wins against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough and a home win against West Ham United. The second season saw them finishing 17th with the highlight of the season a 1–1 draw with Arsenal in the League Cup at Highbury. During the 2004–05 season, the club struggled and spent most of the season bottom of the league. After relegation to League One in 2005, Mick Harford took over as Millers manager, but was sacked after a run of 17 games without a win. Harford was replaced by youth team coach, Alan Knill. Early in 2006 it was announced that the club faced an uncertain future unless a funding gap in the region of £140,000 per month could be plugged. An eleventh-hour intervention by a consortium of local businessmen kept them in business. The final match of the 2005–06 season, home to MK Dons, was a winner-take-all relegation showdown where a scoreless draw kept Rotherham up. Rotherham United began their second successive year in League One with a 10-point deficit as a result of the CVA which saved the club from liquidation. The club initially pulled the points back but, after losing key playmaker Lee Williamson and star striker Will Hoskins in the January transfer window, the Millers sat 13 points adrift of safety, making the threat of relegation inevitable. This resulted in Knill being sacked on 1 March, with Mark Robins becoming caretaker manager. Robins's position was made permanent on 6 April 2007, but he was not able to save Rotherham from relegation. The Millers spent the majority of the 2007–08 season in the automatic promotion places but in mid-March 2008 it was revealed that Rotherham had again entered administration and would be deducted 10 points. Local businessman Tony Stewart then took over as Chairman for the 2008–09 season and took the club out of administration via a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, resulting in a 17-point deduction. The Millers were subsequently forced to leave Millmoor, their home of over 100 years, for the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, after disputes with the landlords. The Millers had a successful season under the new regime, wiping out the point deficit and being in contention for a play-off place. Rotherham were also involved in two cup runs, reaching the Football League Trophy Northern Final and the League Cup last 16. This included victories over higher league opposition in the form of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester City and Leeds United. Mark Robins kept the majority of the team together from the 2008–09 campaign, whilst bolstering his squad with high calibre signings in the form of Nicky Law, and the prolific goalscorer, Adam le Fondre. The 2009–10 season started well until Mark Robins controversially departed to rivals Barnsley in September. Robins left the Millers at the top of the league. Ex manager Ronnie Moore was reappointed on Friday 25 September 2009; Jimmy Mullen later being confirmed as his assistant. Ronnie led the club to their first ever play-off final and first trip to the new Wembley Stadium. Despite the occasion, this game ended in a disappointing 3–2 loss. On 22 March 2011, following poor form and a run of 5 games without a win (including a 5–0 defeat to rivals, Chesterfield), Moore and his assistant Jimmy Mullen left Rotherham by mutual consent, with Andy Liddell placed in temporary charge. Liddell's first game in temporary charge of the club was a superb 6–0 victory at eventually relegated Lincoln City. Despite Chairman, Tony Stewart stating that Liddell would be in charge for the remainder of the season, he moved to appoint Andy Scott as the new club manager, following several disappointing results. During the close season, Andy Scott released 13 of the millers squad, surprisingly including key members of the team. Scott announced that there would be several ""marquee"" signings to improve the quality of the team, and brought in several players from divisions higher, including Schofield, Raynes, Pringle and Grabban. After an impressive start to the season, results steadily declined; Andy Scott was subsequently sacked on 19 March 2012 after a defeat to Oxford left the Millers with all but a very slim chance of reaching the Play Offs. Chairman Tony Stewart had over 40 applicants for the managers vacancy, including former Premier League and Championship managers, but appointed Steve Evans on 9 April 2012. Despite winning five of their last nine games since Andy Scott's dismissal, Rotherham still finished 5 points outside the play offs. The 2012/13 season signalled a new era for Rotherham United as the club returned to playing home matches in Rotherham, at the newly-built New York Stadium. With the team looking the strongest it had done for years, the two factors seemed appropriate to add up and result in promotion. But it wasn't that straight forward. Despite demolishing Burton Albion on 18 August 2012 on the opening day, and a tasty 4–0 victory over Bradford City, the forthcoming months only saw inconsistent form. There were big defeats, and scalp claiming cup victories along the way, but with the club's main goal of promotion seemingly slipping away from its grasp, some fans called for the sacking of Steve Evans. But all was not lost, results began picking up and teams were falling, including more local derby victories. As the team gradually increased their position in the League, only a record breaking 5 games in a row winning streak and other results going their way, would see Rotherham promoted. Against all the odds, the Millers became the first team in that season to win 5 games in a row, claiming 15/21 points that month. Rival teams slipped up allowing Rotherham to storm past them, and with Port Vale (a team who had been second or first all season) failing to win on the final day, they managed to climb into second and claim the runners up spot behind Gillingham, as on 27 April 2013, Rotherham United sealed promotion from League Two to League One with a 2 – 0 victory over bottom of the table Aldershot. Stadia. The club's traditional home was Millmoor in Rotherham where the team played from 1907 to 2008. On one side of the ground is the site of the new Main Stand which remains unfinished. It was hoped that the 4,500 capacity stand which is single tiered, all seated and covered, would be completed sometime during the 2006–07 season, but this had not come to fruition by the time the ground became disused in 2008. On the other side of the ground is the Millmoor Lane Stand, which has a mixture of covered and open seating. Roughly each section on this side is about a third of the length of the pitch. The covered seating in the middle of this stand looks quite distinctive, with several supporting pillars and an arched roof. Both ends are former terraces, with several supporting pillars and have now been made all seated. The larger of the two is the Tivoli End, which was used by home fans. It was noticeable that the pitch slopes up towards this end. The ground also benefits from a striking set of floodlights, the pylons of which are some of the tallest in the country at approximately 124 feet high. Following the failure of the owners of the club and the owners of Millmoor to reach a lease agreement the club left for the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield in 2008. Whilst a new purpose-built community stadium was being built in Rotherham, the club relocated to the Don Valley Stadium in nearby Sheffield for four seasons from 2008–09 to 2011–12. In January 2010 the club announced that their new stadium, later named the New York Stadium, would be built on the former Guest and Chrimes Foundry site in Rotherham town centre. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8484735.stm] Preparation work on the site began in February 2010 to make way for the foundations to be put in place and for the old Guest and Chrimes factory to be knocked down to make way for the Stadium. Construction started in June 2011 and the first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012. The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0, Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground. Statistics. Club honours.

wikipedia-386369," Lines of Torres Vedras  The Lines of Torres Vedras were lines of forts built in secrecy to defend Lisbon during the Peninsular War. Named after the nearby town of Torres Vedras, they were ordered by Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington, constructed by Sir Richard Fletcher, 1st Baronet and his Portuguese workers between November 1809 and September 1810, and used to stop Masséna's 1810 offensive. Genesis. After his troubling Spanish experience at the Battle of Talavera, Wellington decided to strengthen Portugal. He used a report of Colonel Vincent, ordered by Junot in 1807, describing the excellent defensive capacities in the region nearby Lisbon. It has been suggested that the study by Major Neves Costa influenced Wellington's decision to construct the lines, but in fact the plans pre-date Costa's study. He was also inspired by the Martello Towers along the English Channel coast. Wellington, after surveying the area personally, ordered in his detailed memorandum dated 20 October 1809 the building of the Lines of Torres as a system of fortifications blockhouses, redoubts, ravelins, cuts of natural relief, etc. The work began in the autumn of 1809 and the first line was finished one year later. Construction of the lines continued and in 1812 34,000 men were still working on them.  The work was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Fletcher, assisted by Major John Jones, 11 British officers, four Portuguese Army engineers and two KGL officers. The cost was around £100,000, one of the least expensive but most remunerative military investments in history. Effects. The Anglo-Portuguese Army was forced to retreat to the lines after the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810). The French army under Marshal André Masséna discovered a barren land (under the scorched earth policy) and an enemy behind an impenetrable defensive position. Masséna's forces arrived at the lines on 11 October and took Sobral de Monte Agraço the following day. After driving in the Anglo-Portuguese skirmish line on 13 October, the VIII Corps tried to push forward on the 14th. In the Battle of Sobral they were repulsed in an attempt to assault a strong British outpost.  After attempting to wait out the enemy, Masséna was forced to order a French retreat to Spain, starting on the night of 15 November 1810, to re-supply and reinforce his army. Marshal Masséna began his campaign with his army (l'Armée de Portugal) at 65,000 strong. By the time he reached Torres Vedras, he had 61,000 men (after losing 4,000 at the Battle of Buçaco). When he reached Spain, he had lost 25,000 men (including those lost at Buçaco). One of the coldest winters the area had ever seen hit Portugal and killed many of the French forces. They were also hit by severe illness and disease killing the soldiers in the thousands. The human cost was great for the local population, because of the privations they endured. It is estimated that between October 1810 and March 1811 about 50,000 Portuguese died of hunger or disease. The Allies were reinforced by fresh British troops in 1811 and renewed their offensive. They left the lines and did not return for the rest of the Peninsular War. Description. The three lines of Torres Vedras had redoubts and forts strategically placed in the top of hills, controlling the roads to Lisbon and using the natural obstacles of the land. They did not comprise solid lines, instead they formed groupings of heavily defended areas that were self-supporting, with mobile troops based in fortified camps ready to counterattack when necessary. The first line, with an extension of 46 km, binds Alhandra to the estuary of the Sizandro river. The second line, 13 km to the south, has 39 km and binds the Póvoa de Santa Iria to Ribamar. The third line consisted of a defensive perimeter with 3 km, from Paço de Arcos to the Tower of Junqueira, protecting a beach of embarcation (St. Julian's) about 27 km to the south of the second line, to be protected by British marines. Initially using the Lisbon Militia units plus 5,000 to 7,000 hired peasants and later by conscription of all people within 40 miles, supervised by 18 engineering officers and around 150 NCOs and at a cost of just £100,000 the work was completed, just in time. Within a year, by the time the French arrived 126 forts and redoubts were built, with ravelins, detached batteries, etc. Rivers were dammed, turning large areas into swamps, ravines were choked with abatis, miles of walls were built, some 16 ft high. Lateral roads were constructed to enable swift movement of supporting troops, houses and walls demolished to clear fields of fire, hills were scarped to make an unclimbable precipice, and everything was organised to have channels where cross fire from artillery would decimate an attacking force. The three lines were furnished with 247 pieces of artillery and provided with around 30,000 men, mainly Portuguese militia and home guard ordenanças, plus 8,000 Spanish troops and 2,500 British marines and artillerymen. This left the Regular army, of around 58,000 (being 24,000 Portuguese and 34,000 British), able to manoeuvre behind the first line, to points of danger depending on where the invaders attacked the lines. The majority of the defences were redoubts holding 200 to 300 troops and 3 to 6 cannon, normally 12 pounders which could fire canister shot or round shot. The redoubt was protected by a ditch, normally 16 ft wide and 12 ft deep, with parapets 8 to 14 ft thick fitted with fire steps and the redoubts were pallisaded.  A possible eastern approach down the Tagus was protected with anchored gun boats. The fourth line was built south of the Tagus in the Almada highs to hinder an eventual invasion coming from south, with an extension of 8,000 yards (7.3 km): It had 17 redoubts and covered trenches, 86 pieces of artillery, defended by marines, and orderlies of Lisbon, for a total of 7,500 men. Work continued on the redoubts and 152 were eventually completed.  Substantial portions of the lines still survive today, albeit heavily decayed due to locals re-using 100,000 tons of stones, although there has been some recent renovation work undertaken using EC funding. Efficiency and cohesion. The efficiency and cohesion of the lines was based on five points: 1) Redoubts of artillery with Portuguese artillerymen, commanded by Major-General José António Rosa, and situated to fire into preset zones, where the enemy attack was expected. Both lines extended more than 80 km. The first line had 534 artillery pieces. 2) Military roads to cover the rear of the lines and allowing an extraordinary mobility of forces. In September 1810, the field army had some 66,598 regular soldiers. Including the Ordenanças and Milicias, it had 77,690 men. 3) A semaphore system introduced by the British Navy which allowed a message to be sent around the lines in 7 minutes, or from the HQ to any point in 4 minutes. The signal system had five stations: 4) Secrecy. The building of the lines took, surprisingly, only 10 to 11 months. Lisbon became a peninsula defended by a most efficient system of blockhouses. Everything was preserved as a secret, whose maintenance is as surprising as the building of the lines. Only one report appeared in the London newspapers, a major source of information for Napoleon. It is said that when Masséna was first confronted by the Lines, he asked his staff why they had not known about them in advance. ""Wellington has made them"", replied someone. Masséna shouted, ""To the Devil with you! Did Wellington make the mountains?"" It is also said that not even the British government knew about the forts and was stunned when Wellington first said in despatches he had retreated to them. 5) The ""scorched earth"" policy. North of the lines everything that could supply the invading army was collected, hidden or burnt. A vast tract of land was deserted and perhaps 200,000 inhabitants of the neighbouring districts of the lines were relocated inside the lines. That the French were able to campaign in their vicinity at all was a remarkable feat, according to Wellington: Further reading. NORRIS, A.H. e BREMNER, R. W., The lines of Torres Vedras.

wikipedia-386377," Yongin  Yongin is a major city in the Seoul Capital Area, located in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. With a population of nearly 1 million, the city has developed abruptly since the 21st century, recording the highest population growth of any city in the country. Yongin is home to Everland and Caribbean Bay, South Korea's most popular amusement and water parks. The city is also home to the Korean Folk Village, the largest of its kind. Yongin is a city almost as large as Seoul by area, consisting of the highly urbanized districts of Suji-gu and Giheung-gu and the semi-urbanized district of Cheoin-gu. Yongin's urbanized districts are located close to the capital and many commute to and from downtown Seoul in approximately 30–40 minutes by cars using the Gyeongbu Expressway or Yongin-Seoul Expressway, and the Bundang Line subway, the DX Line subway or metropolitan buses. The Sinbundang Line with a maximum speed of 110 km/h will extend to Suji-gu in late 2015, which will allow Yongin residents to travel to Gangnam Station in 20-30 minutes. The Bundang Line extended south to Giheung Station on December 2011, connecting to EverLine that extends all the way to Everland. On December 2013, the Bundang Line will connect to Suwon Station on Seoul Subway Line 1. Yongin has many university campuses, namely Yong-In University, noted for its sports courses, Myongji University's Yongin Campus, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies' Yongin Campus, the Police University, Kangnam University (named for its former campus in Gangnam-gu in Seoul), Yong-in Songdam College, and Dankook University. The Gyeonggi Suwon International School, an IB World School with a boarding program for foreign students, is situated on the border of Yongin and Suwon. Administrative districts. The city is divided into three ""gu"" (districts): Transportation. Yongin is served by trains on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. The Bundang Line has been extended into Yongin, calling at Jukjeon, Bojeong, Guseong, Singal and Giheung stations; and it is being extended towards Suwon Station, in Suwon. Another new line is being built. Named the EverLine Rapid Transit System, it is scheduled to open in 2012 and will link to the Bundang Line at Giheung Station. From 2016 onwards, the inner Suji area will also be served by four new Sin Bundang Line stations, which will allow Suji residents travel to Gangnam Station in less than 30 minutes.  Yongin has an intercity bus terminal in the city centre, though the densely settled northern areas are served better by the terminal in Yatap-dong, Seongnam. History. Although there is evidence of human settlement here as far back as the fifth century, Yongin was granted city status only in March 1996. "
wikipedia-363536," Notre-Dame de la Garde  Notre-Dame de la Garde (literally Our Lady of the Guard), is a Catholic basilica in Marseille, France. This Neo-Byzantine church was built by the architect Henri-Jacques Espérandieu on the foundations of an ancient fort located at the highest natural point in Marseille, a 149 m (490 ft) limestone outcrop on the south side of the Old Port. It is a major local landmark and the site of a popular annual pilgrimage every year on Assumption Day, August 15. The basilica was consecrated on June 5, 1864 and replaced a church of the same name built in 1214 and restored in the 15th century. It was built on the foundations of a 16th-century fort built by Francis I of France to resist the 1536 siege of Marseilles by the Emperor Charles V. The basilica consists of a lower church, or crypt, in the Romanesque style carved from the rock, as well as an upper church of Neo-Byzantine style decorated with mosaics. A square bell tower of 41 m (135 ft) topped by a belfry of 12.5 m (42 ft) supports a monumental 11.2 m (27 ft) statue of the Madonna and Child, made of copper gilded with gold leaf. The green limestone from the area surrounding Florence used to build the basilica, has been discovered to be sensitive to atmospheric corrosion. An extensive restoration took place from 2001 to 2008, including work on the mosaics that were damaged by candle smoke and the impact of bullets during the Liberation of France at the end of World War II. People from Marseilles traditionally see Notre-Dame de la Garde as the guardian and the protector of the city. Local inhabitants commonly refer to it as ""la bonne mère"" (""the good mother""). Chapel in the 13th century. A unique site. The Bay of Marseilles opens west to the sea. It is bordered by hills—the Massif de l'Étoile and the Nerthe to the north, those of Sainte-Baume to the east, and the Carpiagne and the Massif de Marseilleveyre to the south. In the middle of this broad depression a cretaceous limestone peak rises to a height of 162 metres with the basilica at its summit. Due to its height and closeness to the coast, the hill became an important stronghold and observation and lookout point, as well as a landmark for shipping. In 1302, Charles II of Anjou ordered one of his ministers to set beacons along the Mediterranean coast of Provence. One of these beacon sites was the hill of Notre-Dame du Gard. The first chapel. In 1214 maître Pierre, a Marseilles priest, was inspired to build a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary on the hill known as La Garde, which belonged to the abbey of Saint-Victor. The abbot granted him permission to plant vines, to cultivate a garden there and to build a chapel. The chapel was completed four years later, and appears in a June 18, 1218 papal bull by Pope Honorius III listing the possessions of the abbey. After maître Pierre died in 1256, Notre-Dame de la Garde became a priory. The prior of the sanctuary was also one of four claustral priors of Saint-Victor. From the time the chapel was founded, surviving wills show bequeaths in its favour. Also, sailors who escaped a shipwreck had been giving thanks and depositing ex-votos at Notre-Dame of the Sea in the church of Notre-Dame-du-Mont. Towards the end of the 16th century they began going to Notre-Dame de la Garde instead. The first chapel was replaced at the beginning of the 15th century by a larger building with a richly equipped chapel dedicated to Saint Gabriel. Fort and place of worship from the 16th to 18th centuries. Visit of Francis I. On January 3, 1516 Louise of Savoy, the mother of Francis I of France, and his wife Queen Claude of France, daughter of Louis XII, went south of France to meet the young king, who was fresh from his victory at Marignan. On 7 January 1516 they visited the sanctuary of Notre-Dame de la Garde. On January 22, 1516, Francis accompanied them to the chapel as well. The king noted during this visit that Marseilles was poorly defended. The need to reinforce its defenses became even more obvious in 1524 after the constable Charles III, Duke of Bourbon and Charles Quint lay siege to the city and nearly took it. François I then built two forts: one on the island of If, which became the famous Chateau d'If, the other at the top of La Garde, which included the chapel. This is the only known example of a military fort sharing space with a sanctuary open to the public. The Chateau d'If was finished first, in 1531, while Notre-Dame de la Garde was not completed until in 1536, when it was used to help repel the troops of Charles Quint. Stone from the Cap Couronne was used as well as materials from buildings outside the ramparts of the city demolished to keep them from providing shelter to enemy troops. Among these was the monastery of the Mineurs brothers where Louis of Toulouse was buried near the Cours Belsunce and Cours Saint-Louis. The fort was a triangle with two sides of approximately 75 metres, and a third of 35 metres. This rather modest fort remains visible on a spur west of the basilica which was restored in 1993 to its original state when a 1930 watch tower was removed. Above the door can be seen a very damaged escutcheon of François I, the arms of France, three fleurs-de-lys with a salamander below. Nearby to the right is a rounded stone corroded by time which once represented the lamb of John the Apostle with its banner. Wars of religion. In 1585, Hubert de Garde de Vins, chief of the Catholic League of Provence, sought to seize Marseilles and combine forces with Louis de La Motte Dariès, the second consul of Marseilles and Claude Boniface, captain of the Blanquerie neighborhood. On the night of April 9, 1585, Dariès occupied La Garde, from which his guns could fire on the city. But the attack on Marseilles failed, leading to the execution of Dariès and his accomplice, Boniface. In 1591, Charles Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy, tried to seize the Abbey of Saint Victor, a stronghouse near the port. He charged Pierre Bon, baron de Méolhon, governor of Notre-Dame de la Garde, with seizing the abbey. On 16 November 1591, Méolhon did so but it was quickly retaken by Charles de Casaulx, first consul of Marseilles. In 1594, Charles de Casaulx wanted to take the fort. He sent two priests, Trabuc and Cabot, to celebrate mass in the chapel. Trabuc wore armour under his cassock and after the ceremony killed the captain of the fort. Charles de Casaulx took possession of it and named his son Fabio its governor. After the assassination of Charles de Casaulx on February 17, 1596 by Pierre de Libertat, Fabio was driven out of the fort by his own soldiers. Last royal visit. While in Marseilles on November 9, 1622, Louis XIII rode in spite of the rain to Notre-Dame of la Garde. He was received by the governor of the fort, Antoine de Boyer, lord of Bandol. When the latter died the 29th of June 1642, Georges de Scudéry, mainly known as a novelist, was named governor, but he did not take up his post until December 1644. He was accompanied there by his sister, Madeleine de Scudéry, a woman of letters who gave in her letters many descriptions of the area as well as of various festivals and ceremonies. “Last Friday... you could see the citadel covered from head to foot with ten or more flags, the bells of our tower swinging, and an admirable procession returning to the castle. The statue of Notre-Dame de la Garde holding in her left arm the naked child and in her right hand, a bouquet of flowers, was carried by eight shoeless penitents veiled like ghosts.” Georges de Scudéry scorned the fort and preferred to live at Place de Lenche, the aristocratic quarter of the time. The stewardship of the fort was entrusted to a mere sergeant, named Nicolas. In the 1650 Caze affair, the governor of Provence, the Count of Alais, opposed the Parliament of Provence in the Fronde and wanted to put down the revolt in Marseilles. Since La Garde was a desirable strategic position, he bribed Nicolas and on August 1, 1650 installed there one of his men, David Caze. He hoped to support an attack by galleys from Toulon, a city faithful to him. The consuls of Marseilles reacted to this threat by forcing David Caze to leave the fort. In the 18th century. In 1701 the Dukes of Burgundy and of Berry, grandsons of Louis XIV, visited the sanctuary. Sébastien Vauban, who succeeded Louis Nicolas de Clerville, the builder of Fort Saint Nicolas, studied ways to improve Marseilles' defences. On April 11, 1701, he presented an imposing proposal for a vast enclosure connecting Fort Saint Nicolas to Notre-Dame de la Garde and continuing to the plaine Saint-Michel, currently place Jean-Jaurès, and the quay d'Arenc. This project was not followed through. During the Great Plague of Marseille, which killed 100,000 people in Marseilles in 1720, the bishop Henri de Belsunce went three times on foot to the chapel at the Notre-Dame de la Garde on September 28 and December 8, 1720 and August 13, 1721 to bless the inhabitants of the city. Revolutionary period. Closing of the chapel. On April 30, 1790 the fort was invaded by anti-clerical revolutionaries who crossed the drawbridge on the pretext of attending mass in the chapel, a ruse previously adopted by the ""ligueurs"" in 1594. On June 7, 1792, Trinity Sunday, the day's traditionally large procession was disturbed by demonstrations. During the statue's return to the sanctuary, the Virgin was wrapped in a scarf in the revolutionary tricolour and a Phrygian cap, icon of the French Revolution, was placed on the head of the baby Jesus. On November 23, 1793 the church buildings were closed down and worship ceased. On March 13, 1794, the statue of the Virgin, made in 1661 from silver, was melted down at the mint of Marseilles, number 22 of Rue Tapis-Vert at the former convent of Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy. A prison for princes. In April 1793, the Duke of Orléans Philippe Égalité, his two sons the Duke of Montpensier and the Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais, his sister Louise, Duchess of Bourbon and the Prince of Conti were imprisoned for a few weeks at Notre-Dame de la Garde before their transfer to Fort Saint-Jean. In spite of the lack of amenities in the old apartments of the governor, the prisoners enjoyed the panorama. Each day the Duchess of Bourbon attended mass then went to the fort's terrace and often remained as much as two hours in contemplation. The princess Louise, who painted well, left behind a pencil drawing of Marseilles as seen from the Virgin of Notre-Dame de la Garde. A providential man: Escaramagne. The last of the objects from the sanctuary were auctioned off on 10 April 1795. The chapel was nationalized and rented to Joseph Escaramagne. A former ship's captain who lived in what is now the current place du Colonel-Edon, Escaramagne had a deep devotion for the Virgin. After worship resumed in some parishes, he wrote in September 1800 to the Minister of War, Lazare Carnot, asking for the reopening of the sanctuary. But prefect Charles-François Delacroix voiced opposition when the minister consulted him. The chapel finally re-opened for worship on the 4th of April 1807. Escaramagne bought at auction an 18th-century statue of the Virgin and child from a monastery of the Picpus Fathers that had been demolished during the Revolution. He offered the statue to the La Garde church. The scepter that the virgin had held was replaced by a bouquet of flowers, hence the name “Virgin of the bouquet”. To make way for a new silver statue created in 1837, this statue was given to the Montrieux monastery, then returned in 1979 to the sanctuary. This statue of the Virgin of the bouquet is currently displayed on the altar in the crypt. Renaissance of the sanctuary. On the day the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Garde was reopened for worship, a procession started from the cathedral bringing to the sanctuary the statue that Escaramagne had bought. The traditional procession of the Fête-Dieu resumed in 1814. Julie Pellizzone mentions this event in her diary: “On Sunday June 12, 1814, Fête-Dieu, the gunners of the city guard went in the morning with barefoot penitents to get Our Lady of the Guard and to bring her into town, according to the ancient custom. She was greeted by several cannon blasts. Mass was said, then she was brought here, carried by penitents with their hoods covering their faces, a procession such as had not taken place since the Revolution. Enlarging the chapel. During this period the fort itself went almost unused while the number of people visiting the chapel increased significantly. This increase was so great that the 150 square meter chapel was extended in 1833 with the addition of a second nave, which increased its area to approximately 250 square meters. The bishop of Marseilles, Fortuné de Mazenod, consecrated this chapel in 1834. Distinguished visitors. After escaping a shipwreck while returning from Naples, the Duchess of Berry climbed to the chapel on 14 June 1816 and left a silver statuette as an ex voto. This statue was unfortunately melted down a few years later. Marie Therese of France, daughter of Louis XVI and Duchess of d'Angoulême, climbed to Notre-Dame de la Garde on May 15, 1823, a day with strong mistral winds. Despite the wind, the duchess remained on the terrace, struck by the beauty of the view. In 1838 the Virgin of the Guard had another distinguished visitor: François-René de Chateaubriand. A new silver statue. Thanks to a gift of 3000 francs from the Duchess of Orleans made while travelling through Marseilles in May 1823 and to various other offerings, a new statue of the Virgin was commissioned to replace the one melted down during the French Revolution. In 1829, Marseilles goldsmith Jean-Baptiste Chanuel, an artistan with a workshop in the Street of the Dominicans, began work on this statue based on a model by the sculptor Jean-Pierre Cortot. This very delicate work of hammered gold was finished in 1834. On July 2, 1837 Fortuné de Mazenod blessed the statue on the Cours Belsunce, which as then brought to the top of the hill. It replaced the Virgin of the Bouquet, which was given to Montrieux Monastery. and later returned to the crypt in 1979. The two statues, the Virgin of the Bouquet and the silver Virgin, thus pre-date the basilica where they are displayed. The great bell. The rebuilding of the bell tower in 1843 was accompanied by the purchase of not just a new bell but a great bell commissioned from the Lyons foundery of Gédéon Morel thanks to a special collection among the faithful. It was cast on February 11, 1845 and arrived in Marseilles on September 19, 1845. It was placed in Jean-Jaurès square and blessed on Sunday October 5, 1845 by Eugène de Mazenod and baptized “Marie Joséphine”. The bell's godfather was André-Élisée Reynard then mayor of Marseilles and the godmother the wife of shipping magnate Wulfran Puget, ""née"" Canaple. Their names are engraved on the bell. On October 7, the bell, which weighed was placed on a harnessed carriage of sixteen horses. It descended by Thiers Street, Leon Gambetta Alley, the Rue Tapis-Vert, the Cours Belsunce, Canebière, the Rue Paradis, and the Cours Pierre-Puget. Ten horses were added there to the convoy, bringing their number to twenty-six. On 8 October 1845 the ascent of the bell up the hill began with the help of capstans and continued until Friday October 10, when the bell arrived at the summit. The bell was set up on Wednesday October 15. It rang out its first notes on December 8, day of the Immaculate Conception. On this occasion the poet Joseph Autran composed a poem: Like the statues of the Virgin displayed in the interior of the basilica, the bell came before the construction of the current building. Construction of the current basilica. Negotiations with the army. The person in charge of the chapel, Father Jean-Antoine Bernard, asked the Ministry of War on 22 June 1850 to authorize an expansion of the existing chapel. On October 22, 1850, the very same day he resigned, Alphonse Henri d'Hautpoul, Minister of War, said the request was too vague. He agreed to an expansion in principle but invited a more precise proposal. April 8, 1851, a new request called for construction of a new and larger church with essentially the same surface area as the existing buildings. In other words, this amounted to no longer having military buildings inside the fort. Thanks to the support of the general Adolphe Niel, the fortifications committee gave a favorable opinion when it met on January 7, 1852. Authorization to build a new chapel was given by the Minister of War on February 5, 1852. The planning and the search for financing could begin. The project. On 1 November 1852, Monseigneur Eugene de Mazenod requested offerings from the members of the parish. Studies were requested from various architects. The administration council of the chapel met on 30 December 1852 with Mazenod. The proposal presented by Leon Vaudoyer, who worked with Cathédrale Sainte-Marie-Majeure, was the only one of Romano-Byzantine style; the others were Neo-Gothic. Each project received five votes, but the vicar's tie-breaking vote went to Vaudoyer, whose project was commissioned. The plans were in fact drawn up by Henri-Jacques Espérandieu, his former pupil and then only twenty-three years old. On June 23, 1853 Espérandieu was named architect and developed the project. While he was Protestant, it does not seem that his religion was a major cause of the difficulties he encountered with the committee in charge of the work. It decided, without consulting him, not to put work up for competitive bidding, but to award it on August 9, 1853 directly to Pierre Bérenger, contractor and architect of the Saint-Michel church, who had himself proposed one of the Neo-Gothic plans and who was a close relative of Monseigneur Mazenod. The commission also imposed their choice of artists, such as sculptor Joseph-Marius Ramus and the painter Karl Müller of Düsseldorf, without concern for whether their works would fit within the structure. Karl Müller's commission later not approved, which allowed the architect to direct mosaics as decoration. A difficult construction. The first stone was laid by the bishop of Marseilles, Monseigneur de Mazenod on September 11, 1853. Work began but financial problems quickly developed because the foundations had to be laid in a very hard rock. In 1855, the government authorized a lottery, but this produced less revenue than anticipated. The financial shortfall grew larger when the sanctuary commission decided to enlarge the crypt. Rather than only underlying the chorus, it was to extend under the entire higher vault. In spite of a loan secured by the personal assets of the bishop, building stopped from 1859 to 1861, the year of Mazenod's death. The new bishop, Patrice Cruice, arrived at the end of August 1861, and resumed work. The generosity of citizens of all religions and all social positions allowed completion of the work, from the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie, who visited the Virgin of the Guard on September 9, 1860, to the poorest of Marseillais. The sanctuary was dedicated on Saturday June 4, 1864 by the Cardinal of Villecourt, member of the Roman curia, in the presence of forty-three other bishops. In 1866, a pavement in mosaic was laid in the upper church and the square bell tower was finished; the bell was installed in October of the same year. In 1867, a cylindrical pedestal or belfry was built on the square bell tower to receive the monumental statue of the virgin. The statue was financed by the town of Marseilles. Sketches for the statue made by three Parisian artists, Eugène-Louis Lequesne, Aimé Millet and Charles Gumery were examined by a jury of Espérandieu the architect, Antoine-Théodore Bernex, mayor of Marseilles, and Philippe-Auguste Jeanron, director of the School of Fine Arts, Antoine Bontoux, sculptor and professor of sculpture and Luce, president of the Civil Court and administrator of the sanctuary. The committee selected the proposal of Lequesne. For reasons of cost and weight, copper was chosen as the medium for the statue. A very new method for the time was adopted for the realization of the statue: galvanoplasty, a type of electroplating, or ""the art of moulding without the help of fire"" was chosen over hammered copper. A scientific report of November 19, 1866 said that electrotype copper allowed an ""irreproachable reproduction"" and a solidity that left nothing to be desired. Only Eugène Viollet-le-Duc thought that the galvanoplasty technique would not long resist the atmospheric pollution in Marseilles. Espérandieu had the statue made in four sections because of the difficulty of getting it up the hill and to the top of the bell tower. He inserted into the center of the sculpture an iron arrow, core of a spiral staircase to the Virgin's head, to be used for maintenance and sight-seeing. This metal structure, used to support the statue, made it possible to assemble the whole by connecting it to the body of the tower. The execution of the statue, entrusted to the workshops of Charles Christofle, was finished in August 1869. The first elements were assembled on May 17, 1870 and the statue was dedicated on September 24, 1870, but without fanfare since defeat by the Prussian army dampened all spirits The statue was gilded, which required gold, and regilding in 1897, 1936, 1963 and 1989. In March 1871 Gaston Crémieux formed the revolutionary Commune of Marseilled. Helped by followers of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the rebels seized the Prefecture of the Rhone delta and took the prefect captive. On March 26, 1871 General Henri of Villeboisnet retreated to Aubagne, but undertook to retake the city beginning on April 3. The rebels who took refuge in the prefecture took fire from the batteries installed in Fort Saint Nicolas and in Notre-Dame de la Garde. They capitulated on April 4 and said that the Virgin changed name and should from then on be called “Notre-Dame of bombardment” Following the death of Espérandieu on September 11, 1874, Henri Antoine Révoil was charged with finishing the interior of the basilica, in particular the mosaics. The construction of the major crypt and installation of the mosaics in the choir was carried out in 1882. Unfortunately a fire on June 5, 1884 destroyed the alter and the mosaic in the choir; moreover the statue of the Virgin was damaged. The statue and the mosaics were restored and the altar was rebuilt according to the drawings of Révoil. On 26 April 1886 cardinal Charles Lavigerie consecrated the new crypt. In 1886, walnut stalls were built in the choir; the last mosaics in the side vaults were finished between 1887 and 1892. In 1897, the two bronze doors of the upper church and the mosaic above them were installed and the statue of the Virgin was regilded for the first time. Final completion of the basilica thus took place more than forty years after the first stone was laid. The funicular. In 1892 a funicular to ascend the cliff was built and became known as the ""ascenseur"", or elevator. The station was located at the lower end of Rue Dragon, while the upper station led directly onto a footpath to the terrace beneath the basilica. This left only a short climb to the level of the crypt at 162 m. Construction took two years. The funicular consisted of two cabins weighing 13 tons when empty, circulating on parallel cogged tracks. The movement was produced by a system called “hydraulic balance”; each cabin, in addition to its two floors capable of holding fifty passengers total, was equipped with a 12 cubic meter tank of water. The cabins were linked by a cable; the tank of the descending cabin was filled with water and that of the ascending cabin emptied. This ballasting started the system moving. The vertical distance between the two stations was 84 m. The water collected at the foot of the apparatus at the end of each trip was brought back to the top with 25-horsepower a pump—truly horsepower, because the pump was activated by the vapor. Travel time was two minutes, but filling the upper tank took more than ten minutes, forcing waits between departures, in spite of often considerable crowds. The last adventure after the ascent was crossing the 100-meter footbridge up the steep slope. Built by Gustave Eiffel, it was only broad and the mistral winds could be very strongly felt there. On August 15, 1892, the number of visitors exceeded The advent of the automobile killed the funicular. On September 11, 1967 with , the funicular was shut down as unprofitable. It was demolished after having transported 20 million passengers over 75 years. The Liberation of France. On August 24, 1944 General Joseph de Monsabert ordered to General Sudre to take Notre-Dame de la Garde, which was covered in German army blockhouses. But his orders stipulated “no air raid, no large-scale use of artillery. This legendary rock will have to be attacked by infantrymen supported by armoured tanks”. The primary attack was entrusted to Lieutenant Pichavant, who commanded the 1st company of the 7th regiment of Algerian riflemen. On August 25, 1944 at 6am, troops began moving towards the hill but very slowly, because sniping from German riflemen impeded their advance. One French soldier, Pierre Chaix-Bryan, was familiar with the neighborhood, and knew that at No. 26 Cherchel street, (now Rue Jules-Moulet) a hallway ran through the building to a staircase unknown to the Germans. A commemorative plaque marks this spot today. The Algerian riflemen used this staircase and arrived under the command of Roger Audibert at the Cherchel plateau. Other soldiers took the staircases up the Notre-Dame slope from the boulevard of the same name. The attackers on the northern face came under fire from the blockhouses then were also attacked from the rear by the guns of Fort Saint-Nicolas. The support of the tanks was essential. In early afternoon the tanks of the 2nd regiment of cuirassiers of the 1 D.B also attacked from Boulevard Gazzino, now Boulevard André-Aune, and from the church slope. The tank named ""Jeanne d' Arc"" was hit full force and stopped at the place du Colonel Edon, and its three occupants were killed. The tank can still be seen today. A second tank, the ""Jourdan"", hit a mine but was protected by a rocky overhang, and so could continue shooting. This had a decisive effect not known until later. The German non-commissioned specialist in charge of the flame throwers was killed by Jourdan's fire. Because of this a young, inexperienced German soldier prematurely ignited the flame throwers, which failed but allowed the French to spot site of the guns. Around 3:30pm a section of the 1st company of the 7th Algerian riflemen under Roger Audibert, joined by Ripoll, took the hill by storm. They were greeted by Monseigneur Borel, who had taken refuge in the crypt. The French flag was hoisted atop the bell tower, although the position was still shelled from the Angelus and from Fort Saint Nicolas, until they too were retaken. In the evening the German officer who had commanded the German troops at Notre-Dame de la Garde returned. He was wounded and died two days later. The liberation of Marseilles took place on the morning of August 28, 1944. Architecture. The exterior of the building is notable for its layered stonework in contrasting colours: white Calissane limestone alternates with layers of green Golfalina stone in a style reminiscent of Florence. Inside the upper church, the variety of coloured marbles and multicolored pictorial mosaics is of particular note. Access to the building is from a plaza 100 feet (35 m) wide that leads to a drawbridge. From the plaza one may either directly enter the crypt or climb a stairway to the entrance porch of the upper church. The building can be considered as a succession of spaces: the porch and bell tower, a nave flanked by side chapels, the transept, dome, choir and apse. External. The bell tower. At a height of 41 meters (130 ft), the square bell tower above the entrance porch has two identical storeys of five blind arches, with the central arch bearing a window with a small balcony. This is surmounted by a belfry, with each face made up of three large bays divided by red granite columns, behind which are abat-sons. This belfry is topped by a bordered square terrace with an openwork stone baluster bearing the arms of the city on each side and an angel with a trumpet at each corner. These four statues were carved by Eugène-Louis Lequesne. From the square terrace a cylindrical bell tower rises to a height of 12.5 metres (40 feet). It is made of sixteen red granite columns supporting a monumental statue of the Virgin Mary, 11.2 metres (36 feet) tall. A staircase within the bell tower allows access to the terrace and to the statue. However, access to the stairs is forbidden to the public. One reaches the upper church through bronze doors designed by Henri Révoil. The central door panels bear the monogram of the Virgin placed within a circle of pearls resembling the rosary. The tympanum above the main entrance is decorated with a mosaic of the Assumption of the Virgin, patterned after an painting by Louis Stanislas Faivre-Duffer. Side walls. The sides of the nave are divided into three equal parts. In the center of each, a window lights a side chapel. The pilasters and the arches are built of stones and keystones in alternating green and white colors. Basement windows at ground level give a little light to the underground chapels of the crypt. Since the nave is higher than the side chapels, the paired bay windows light the three spherical vaults of the nave, but these bay windows are not visible from the terrace. Transept, dome and apse. The transept, lit by two paired windows surmounted by rose windows, is oriented east to west. On its axis rises an octagonal dome nine meters in diameter, composed of thirty-two facets, at intersection of which is a cross. Each face of the octagonal contains a window framed by two red granite columns, with the arch topped by a triangular pediment. The semicircular apse is decorated with five framed blind arcades each of two red granite columns. The sacristy behind hides part of the apse. Interior. The contrast is striking between the sober crypt and the sumptuous of upper church. The low-ceilinged crypt is not very well-lit and is without decoration while the upper church is lighted by bay windows and richly decorated with multicolored marble and mosaics. Crypt. In the entrance hall under the bell tower are two marble statues representing Mazenod and Pope Pius IX, carved by Joseph Ramus. In this hall two staircases on either side of the entrance lead to the sacristy, chorus, and primary altar of the upper church, but they are not open to the public. Built entirely in Roman style, the crypt is composed of a nave with a semi-circular arched ceiling, bordered by six side chapels corresponding exactly to those of the upper church. The primary altar is of Golfalina stone. Behind the altar is the statue of the Virgin of the Bouquet. In the side chapels plates are placed bearing the name of the various givers having answered the call of Cruice. The side furnace bridges are devoted to Saint Philomena, Saint Andrew, Saint Rose, Saint Henri, Saint Louis and Saint Benedict Labre the model of Paul Verlaine when he converted. Upper church. The interior dimensions of the upper church are rather modest. The nave is 32.7 m long and 14 m wide. Each side chapel measures 3.8 m by 5.4 m. The upper church has sumptuous mosaics and columns and marble pilasters alternating red and white. The white Carrara marble was an obvious choice, on the other hand the choice of marble for the red was less clear. Espérandieu wanted a red that would harmonize with the mosaics and not clash too much with the whiteness of the Carrara marble. The monumental mason Jules Cantini discovered just the right marble in the locality known as “the beautiful stones” in the commune of La Celle near Brignoles (Var), a vein of red marble shot with of yellow and white that took a polish beautifully. Mosaics on the ceilings and the walls covering approximately were created between 1886 and 1892 by the Mora company from Nimes. The tiles, came from Venice, and were manufactured by craftsmen at the top of their art. Each panel comprises close to tiles with the m2, which means that the basilica contains approximately 12 million small squares of 1 to . These mosaics constitute an exceptional whole because of the complexity of the decorations, carried out by reputed architects and painters and due to the quality of the tiles. The floors are covered with approximately 380 sq m of Roman mosaics in a geometric pattern. The nave. The mosaic-covered nave has exotic atmosphere tinged with orientalism. It is topped by three cupolas decorated with identical mosaics: on a field of flowers doves form a circle around a central floret. The colours of the flowers differ for each cupola: white for the first, blue for the second and red for the third. In the four corners of each, where the dome of the cupola meets the pillars, are medallions depicting figures from the Old Testament. The following medallions are observed: Mosaics of the first coupole The transept. The large cupola in the middle of the transept is decorated d' a mosaic representing four angels on bottom d' however s' raising ground towards the raised sky and supporting, arms, a crown of pinks qu' they offer to the Virgin Mary represented by her monogram placed at the center of the composition. With the repercussions of the cupola, in the corbellings, the four evangelists are represented: Saint Mark symbolized by a lion, Saint Luke by a bull, Saint John the Evangelist by an eagle and Saint Matthew by a man. L' blind arcade of the bedside, above l' apse, contains a mosaic representing the Annunciation of Mary: on the right the archangel Gabriel, sent by God, called to Mary ""And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS."" (Luke 1:31). On the left, the Virgin Mary gives her consent. Sculptures and mosaics of the transept The chorus. The Master furnace bridge designed by Révoil, carried out by Jules Cantini between 1882 and 1886, is out of white marble with a formed base of five gilded bronze blind arcades resting on posts in lapis lazuli with a decoration of mosaics. The gate vault in vermeil is framed of two columns and two panels of mosaic representing of the doves drinking in a chalice. Behind the furnace bridge draws up a red marble column supporting a capital d' goldsmithery on which is posed the statue of the virgin carried out out of money pushed back with the hammer by the Marseilles goldsmith Chanuel. Mosaic of the bottom of furnace of l' apse represents in a central medallion, a ship on an agitated sea. On the sail of this ship the monogram of the Virgin is reproduced and, in the sky, a star with has and a M interlaced (Ave Maria: I greet you Marie). This medallion is placed in the center d' a sumptuous decoration representing of rinceaux of foliages and thirty two birds; one can notice the peacock, the parrot, the crested one, gorges it blue, the héron, goldfinch etc. Under this mosaic nine medallions connected to each other by the rinceaux ones of foliages are placed appearing the litanies of the virgin. Mosaic of the half dome of abside Side vaults. Each side vault is devoted to a saint. One finds thus while entering and while going towards the chorus: Vaults latérales Long and meticulous restoration: 2001-2008. The interior frontages having aged much and mosaics having been badly restored after the war, of great work of restoration were undertaken of 2001 to 2008 pennies the control of the architect Xavier David. It took four years d' studies before launching work that lasted from 2001 to 2008 and were financed thanks to the participation of the local government agencies and in private gifts of private individuals or d' establishments of the area. External restoration. If the majority of the stones used proved with time very resistant, it was not in the same way for the called green stone Golfalina. This beautiful stone lasts s' is very quickly degraded under l' effect of industrial and domestic pollution coming in particular from the combustion of coal. It is exhausted on a thickness of 3 by 5 cm. The career close to Florence d' where this stone had been extracted, was closed for a long time. It was necessary to find another place in a vineyard close to Chianti where 150 cubic metres of Golfalina were extracted. The defective stones were replaced by stones identical but treated to resist the pollutionRevue Marseilles, N° 219, p. 94. Moreover certain metal reinforcements while rusting made burst stones. Two of the reinforcements posed a serious problem: those that girdle the top of the bell tower to reinforce against the swinging of the bell, and those that enclose the major part of the bell tower that supprts the monumental statue. Certain reinforcements were fitted with cathodic protection, and others replaced by stainless steel. Interior restoration. Interior work was even more important. All access, certain stuccos of the high parts damaged by infiltrations have been remade. Then, panels of mosaics, ranges to the Release by the impacts of balls or the glares shells, had been repaired with the techniques of l' time and in the urgency: the tesselles missing ones had been repaired by plaster covered with painting. Moreover, all these mosaics were blackened by the smoke of the candles. The restoration of the mosaics was entrusted to a mosaïste Marseilles Michel Patrizio, whose workmen were trained with the school of mosaic of Spilimbergo, and perpetuates, in Frioul in the north of Venice, technique of the mosaic. As with l' origin the tesselles ones, elements of mosaic, were provided by the Orsoni workshop of Venice. The most damaged part was the central cupola of the nave, which required the change of all the gold mosaics. Certain parts of mosaics, which threatened to fall apart, were consolidated by resin injections. In the arts. Writers. Many writers described the famous basilica. One can retain the following quotations: Painters of the Basilica. Many painters have shown Marseille's port with Notre-Dame's basilica in the background. Paul Signac, who helped to develop to pointillism, painted a tableau in 1905 that is now shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Albert Marquet produced three oeuvres. The first was a drawing executed in ink in 1916 and shown at Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris. The second is an oil on canvas painted in 1916 entitled “The horse at Marseilles”. This painting, now at the Museum of Fine Arts in Bordeaux, shows a horse on the port quay with the hill of Notre-Dame de la Garde in the background. The third, shown at the Annonciade museum at Saint-Tropez, is called “The Port of Marseilles in fog”; the basilica emerges from a misty landscape where the purification of form is extended. This last painting indicates this painter did not always represent the port of Marseilles from the front. In their liking, he moved his easel to the riverbank side, sometimes close to the town hall to represent the hill of Notre-Dame de la Garde. Charles Camoin painted two canvases in 1904 on which Notre-Dame de la Garde: “The old port with barrels” which is at the Gelsenkirchen museum and “The Old Port and Notre-Dame de la Garde” shown at the Fine Art museum of Le Havre. This museum also possesses a painting by Raoul Dufy made in 1908, entitled “The Port of Marseilles”. In 1920, Marcel Leprin made a pastel drawing “Notre-Dame de la Garde seen from the town hall”: this work is in the small palace museum in Geneva. Louis-Mathieu Verdilhan, about 1920 “The canal from Fort St. John”; the silhouette of Notre-Dame de la Garde is at the bottom of the painting with a boat in the foreground. This painting is in Paris, at the National Museum of Modern Art. The Good Mother. The Notre-Dame basilica of the Guard is considered by the Marseilles population as their guardian and the protectoress of the city, hence current naming of 'good mother'. The ex-votos. A Mediterranean-style religiosity is expressed here with numerous dotive candles and ex-votos offered to the Virgin to thank her for spiritual or temporal grace and to proclaim publicly and remembrance of such grace. One of the oldest documents concerning this practice is a deed of 11 August 1425 in which a certain Jean Aymar paid five guilders for the purchase for wax images offered in recognition of the Virgin. During his voyage in the South of France at the beginning of the 19th century, Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison was struck by the number of ex-voto of Notre-Dame de la Garde: “The way that leads to the oratory is stiff and difficult. The vault is small and narrow, but decorated everywhere with tributes from mariners: on the ceiling small vessels are suspended with their rigs and have their name registered on the stern; they are what the mother of Christ has saved from cruel shipwreck or the fury of pirates and corsairs”. Walls of the side vaults of the two sanctuaries, the crypt and upper church, are covered with a first level of marble slabs. The upper walls of these side vaults are occupied by ex-votos painted placed on several superimposed ranges. The majority of these ex-votos date only from the second half of the 19th century because those from before the Revolution were dispersed during this period. The representations relate to the most numerous shipwrecks and storms. One can also see very different scenes: fire, car accident or railway, patient in his bed etc. Political and social events are also represented. The events of May 68 are the inspiration for one drawing and an Olympique de Marseille flag recalls that the players of the club mounted a pilgrimage to the basilica after a victory. Space has become insufficient, the latest votive plates are placed on the walls of the terraces of the basilica. Finally the upper church retains many models of boats and planes recently restored and traditionally suspended from the roof of the building. The symbol of Marseille. Visible from the motorways entering Marseille, Notre-Dame de la Garde is the city's most well-known symbol. It is most-visited site in Marseille, and accommodates hundreds of people each day. For the cardinal Etchegaray, former bishop of Marseille, the Virgin de la Garde ""does not form only part of the landscape like Chateau d'If or the Old Port, but it is the living heart of Marseille, its central artery more than the Canebière. It is not the exclusive property of Catholics, it belongs to the human family which lives in Marseille."" Notre-Dame de la Garde more remains the high point of the diocese of Marseille even more than the cathedral. It was here that Jean Delay, on 30 August 1944, hoped that deep reforms bring to the poorest living and working conditions more just and human. It was also here that Etchegaray compared, in May 1978, the ravages of unemployment to the those of the plague of Marseille of 1720. Notre-Dame de la Garde is well a window of the diocÃ¨se and the best platform of her Ã©vÃªques. Popular tourist site. While it is difficult to ascertain the exact number of people visiting Notre-Dame de la Garde, it is generally estimated that it receives around a million and half visitors each year, among which there are of course numbers of tourists simply there to admire the view. The motivations of the pilgrims are varied, although many leave messages and inscriptions. One inscription sums up many of these perfectly: ""I came here for the peace and the comfort one finds at the feet of the Blessed Virgin, also for the feast for the eyes offered by the basilica, for the panorama, the pure air, the space, and the feeling of liberation.” Square and accesses of the basilica one discovers a splendid panorama of the city of Marseilles. With the increase in the number of cruise ships making stopover or on the basis of Marseille, excursions to Notre-Dame are a common part of one-city visits to the ""Ville phocéenne"". The basilica is served by bus service from the Old Port (Jean-Ballard Course). Finally there are two ways to climb to the basilica on foot - from either the north or south. "

The decision to build a metro was made in 1941. The following years, some routes were built with near metro standard but operated with trams. The first part of the metro was opened in 1950, when an underground tram line from 1933 called Södertunneln was converted to metro standard. This line ran south from Slussen to Hökarängen. Over the following years, two more lines extending from Slussen (via Gullmarsplan, then Johanneshov) were opened. In 1952, a second system from Hötorget to the western suburbs was opened. In 1957, the two parts were connected via the Central station (at T-Centralen) and the Old Town (at Gamla stan metro station), forming the Green Line. The Red Line was opened in 1964, with two lines going from northeast to southwest via the city center. The third and final system, the Blue Line, was opened in 1975, with two lines running northwest from the city center. The latest addition to the whole network, Skarpnäck station, was opened in 1994. Network. Stations. There are 100 stations in use in the Stockholm metro. One station, Kymlinge, was built but never taken into use. One station has been taken out of use and demolished. The Bagarmossen old surface station was demolished and replaced with a new underground station there instead, this prior to the metro extension to the Skarpnäck metro station. The Stockholm metro is well known for its decoration of the stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world. Several of the stations (especially on the Blue Line) are left with the bedrock exposed, crude and unfinished, or as part of the decorations. At Rissne, an informative wall fresco about the history of Earth's civilizations runs along both sides of the platform. Lines. The following details relate to the present network. The designations ""blue line,"" etc., have only been used since the late 1970s, and officially only since the 1990s. They originated from the fact that the ""blue line"" tended to operate newer train stock painted blue, while the ""green line"" had older stock in the original green livery. There was never any red painted stock, though, but red (or originally orange) was chosen to differentiate this line from the other two networks on route maps. Trains are operated from 05:00 to 01:00, with extended all night service on Fridays and Saturdays. All lines have trains every 10 minutes during daytime, reduced to every 15 minutes in early mornings and late evenings, and every 30 minutes during nights. Additional trains in peak hours gives a train every 5–6 minutes on most stations, with 2–3 minutes between trains on the central parts of the network. The entire metro system only contains two interchange junctions (""""T-Centralen"""" and """"Fridhemsplan"""") and lacks any kind of circular (or partly circular) line. A wide majority of the stations are located in suburbs. In the past, there have been additional line numbers in use for trains operated on part of a line, or during peak hours only. For example, line number 23 was used for a peak relief train for line 13 which in the 1970s was operated between Sätra and Östermalmstorg and during the 1990s between Norsborg and Mörby Centrum. Technology. Rolling stock. There are two main types of cars in the Stockholm metro. The newer C20 stock, and the older C1–C15 stocks which are collectively referred to as the Cx stock. A train typically consists of two or three cars of the C20 stock connected in double or triple configuration (six or nine cars), or six or eight cars of the Cx stock. A full length train—three C20 cars, or eight Cx cars—is about in length, and takes about 1,250 passengers, of which about 380 can be seated. The Blue Line as well as the Red Line (from Stadion to Mörby Centrum) was built with longer platforms to allow running trains consisting of ten Cx cars. When the C20 was introduced, it appeared that trains consisting of four C20 cars would not fit completely on these platforms. There are 271 cars of the C20 stock, and around 250 Cx stock cars. The green line only uses the new cars, and they are used most of the time on the Red and Blue Lines. However, during rush hours, especially on shortened services, older cars are commonly seen. Of the older cars the stocks C6, C14 and C15 are still in use, with the C6's operating on the red line and the C14/C15's on the blue line. C14/C15 trains may occasionally show up on the red line as well. All trains are based at Hammarby, Högdalen and Vällingby Depots on the green line, Nyboda Depot on the red line, and Rissne Depot on the blue line. Historically the metro is converted from a tramway and the older sections were run as tramway for a few years. The naming convention for rolling stock comes from this, where A are motorised trams, B are unmotorised trams (trailers) and C are metro cars. Cx stock cars. The name Cx refers to all the older types C1–C15. The only cars of the Cx stock still in use are C6, C14 and C15. They are to in length, in width, to in height, and weigh 23 to 29 metric tons. The cars take 48 seated passengers, and 108 to 110 standing passengers. They were built in the 1970s and 1980s. C20 stock cars. The C20 car is double-articulated, in length, in width, in height, and weighs . It uses only four bogies, two under the middle part, and one under each end part of car. The car takes 126 seated passengers, and 288 standing passengers. The C20 stock cars were built between 1997 and 2004 and first entered service in 1998. A single prototype car designated C20F stock is in use. Built on Bombardier Transportation's FICAS technology, it has a lighter body, much thinner side walls, and more space compared to the regular C20, by using a sandwich-like composite construction of the body. It also has air-conditioning for passenger area, whereas standard C20 has air-conditioning only for the driver's cab. The C20F weighs , other exterior measurements are the same as for the C20. The C20F has the same number of seats as the C20, but has space for 323 standing passengers. C30 stock cars. The C30 is a future articulated train type intended to be delivered from 2016 onwards for use on the red line. The 80 cars are expected to cost 2-3 billion kronor. Infrastructure and safety. The Stockholm metro runs electrically using a third rail with a nominal operating voltage of 650 V DC on the Green and Red Lines, 750 V DC on the Blue Line. The maximum speed is on the Red and Blue Lines, on the Green Line ( at the platforms). Maximum acceleration and deceleration is 0.8 m/s2. The reason for the lower speed limit on the Green Line is due to tighter curves than on the other lines, because the Green Line was built by cut and cover under streets in the inner city, while the other lines are bored at greater depth. Two safety systems exist in the metro: the older system manufactured by Union Switch & Signal in use on the red and blue lines and a newer autopilot system in use on the green line and manufactured by Siemens. To allow close-running trains with a high level of safety, the metro uses a continuous signal safety system that sends information continually to the train's safety system. The signal is picked up from the rail tracks through two antennas placed in front of the first wheel axle and compared with data about the train's speed. Automatic braking is triggered if the train exceeds the maximum permitted speed at any time. The driver is given information about the speed limit through a display in the driver's cabin; in C20 stock, and in Cx stock outfitted for operation with the new signal system installed on the Green Line, this is a speedometer with a red maximum speed indicator (needle), while the traditional display in the Cx stock is a set of three lights indicating one of three permitted speeds (high, medium, low). The system allows two trains to come close to each other but prevents collisions occurring at speeds greater than . More modern systems also ensure that stop signals are not passed. Another possibility is automatic train operation, which helps the driver by driving the train automatically. However, the driver still operates the door controls and allows the train to start. ATO is as of 2006 only available on the Green line, where a new signal system was installed in the late 1990s. This signal system, together with the C20 rolling stock, permits the use of ATO. The signalling system on the Red Line is however being replaced with Communications-based train control manufactured by Ansaldo STS which will go into operation in 2014. Graffiti. Since the mid-1980s, the Stockholm metro has been seriously affected by graffiti. Previously a train on which graffiti had been painted could remain in service for weeks and graffiti could remain in place at stations for months if not for years. Nowadays, however, trains with graffiti are taken out of service immediately and graffiti at stations is regularly cleaned up within a few days. The cost of graffiti and other types of vandalism has been calculated at approximately SEK 100 million per year. During the 1990s, the Stockholm Transit System (SL) started outsourcing security to private security firms, some of which have been accused of using unlawful methods, such as the use of plain clothes guards and heavy-handed treatment of vandals arrested, and even heavy-handed treatment of ticketless passengers trying to escape. Since 2005, the Stockholm Police have assigned a special task force (""Klotterkommissionen"") to address the issues. The mainstay among the private security contractors in the fight against graffiti is the Commuter Security Group. Future. There are a few realistic plans for extensions in the Stockholm metro in the near decades. "
wikipedia-363546," Dupont Circle  Dupont Circle is a traffic circle, park, neighborhood, and historic district in Northwest Washington, D.C. The traffic circle is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue NW, Connecticut Avenue NW, New Hampshire Avenue NW, P Street NW, and 19th Street NW. The Dupont Circle neighborhood is bounded approximately by 16th Street NW to the east, 22nd Street NW to the west, M Street NW to the south, and Florida Avenue NW to the north. The local government Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC 2B) and the Dupont Circle Historic District have slightly different boundaries. Dupont Circle is served by the Washington Metro Red Line at the Dupont Circle Metro station. There are two entrances: north of the circle at Q Street NW and south of the circle at 19th Street NW. History. Dupont Circle is located in the ""Old City"" of Washington, D.C. — the area planned by architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant — but remained largely undeveloped until after the American Civil War, when there was a large influx of new residents. The area that now constitutes Dupont Circle was once home to a brickyard and slaughterhouse. There also was a creek, Slash Run, that ran from 16th Street near Adams Morgan, through Kalorama and within a block of Dupont Circle, but the creek has since been enclosed in a sewer line. Improvements made in the 1870s by a board of public works headed by Alexander ""Boss"" Shepherd transformed the area into a fashionable residential neighborhood. In 1871, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the traffic circle, then called Pacific Circle, as specified in L'Enfant's plan. On February 25, 1882, Congress renamed the circle to ""Dupont Circle"", and authorized a memorial statue of Samuel Francis Du Pont, in recognition of his service as a rear admiral during the Civil War. The statue, sculpted by Launt Thompson, was erected in 1884, and the circle was landscaped, with exotic flowers and ornamental trees. Several prominent duPont family members deemed it too insignificant to honor their ancestor, so they secured permission to move the statue to Rockford Park in Wilmington in 1917, and commissioned Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French to design the fountain that sits in Dupont Circle today. In 1920, the current double-tiered white marble fountain replaced the statue. Daniel Chester French and Henry Bacon, the co‑creators of the Lincoln Memorial, designed the fountain, which features carvings of three classical figures symbolizing the sea, the stars and the wind on the fountain's shaft. During the 1870s and 1880s, mansions were built along Massachusetts Avenue, one of Washington's grand avenues, and townhouses were built throughout the neighborhood. In 1872, the British built a new embassy on Connecticut Avenue, at N Street NW. By the 1920s, Connecticut Avenue was more commercial in character, with numerous shops. Some residences, including Senator Philetus Sawyer's mansion at Connecticut and R Street, were demolished to make way for office buildings and shops. In 1933, the National Park Service took over administering the circle, and added sandboxes for children, though these were removed a few years later. Connecticut Avenue was widened in the late 1920s, and increased traffic in the neighborhood caused a great deal of congestion in the circle, making it difficult for pedestrians to get around. Medians were installed in 1948, in the circle, to separate the through traffic on Massachusetts Avenue from the local traffic, and traffic signals were added. In 1949 traffic tunnels and an underground streetcar station were built under the circle as part of the now-defunct Capital Transit project. The tunnels allowed trams and vehicles traveling along Connecticut Avenue to pass more quickly past the circle. When streetcar service ended in 1962, the entrances to the underground station were filled in and paved over, leaving only the traffic tunnel. The neighborhood declined after World War II and particularly after the 1968 riots, but began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1970s, fueled by urban pioneers seeking an alternative lifestyle. The neighborhood took on a bohemian feel and became an area popular among the gay and lesbian community. Along with The Castro in San Francisco, Hillcrest in San Diego, Greenwich Village in New York City, Boystown in Chicago, Oak Lawn in Dallas, Montrose in Houston, and West Hollywood in Los Angeles, Dupont Circle is considered a historic locale in the development of American gay identity. D.C.'s first gay bookstore, Lambda Rising, opened in 1974 and gained notoriety nationwide. In 1975, the store ran the world's first gay-oriented television commercial.  Gentrification accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, and the area is now a more mainstream and trendy location with coffeehouses, restaurants, bars, and upscale retail stores. Since 1997, a weekly farmers market has operated on 20th Street NW. Architecture. The area's rowhouses, primarily built before 1900, feature variations on the Queen Anne and Richardsonian Romanesque revival styles. Rarer are the palatial mansions and large freestanding houses that line the broad, tree-lined diagonal avenues that intersect the circle. Many of these larger dwellings were built in the styles popular between 1895 and 1910. One such grand residence is the marble and terra cotta Patterson house at 15 Dupont Circle (currently the Washington Club). This Italianate mansion, the only survivor of the many mansions that once ringed the circle, was built in 1901 by New York architect Stanford White for Robert Patterson, editor of the ""Chicago Tribune"", and his wife Nellie, heiress to the ""Chicago Tribune"" fortune. Upon Mrs. Patterson's incapacitation in the early 1920s, the house passed into the hands of her daughter, Cissy Patterson, who made it a hub of Washington social life. The house served as temporary quarters for President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge in 1927 while the White House underwent renovation. The Coolidges welcomed Charles Lindbergh as a houseguest after his historic transatlantic flight. Lindbergh made several public appearances at the house, waving to roaring crowds from the second-story balcony, and befriended the Patterson Family, with whom he increasingly came to share isolationist and pro-German views. Cissy Patterson later acquired the ""Washington Times-Herald"" (sold to ""Washington Post"" in 1954) and declared journalistic warfare on Franklin D. Roosevelt from 15 Dupont Circle, continuing throughout World War II to push her policies, which were echoed in the ""New York Daily News"", run by her brother Joseph Medill Patterson, and the ""Chicago Tribune"", run by their first cousin, Colonel Robert R. McCormick. Strivers' Section. Today's Dupont Circle includes the Strivers' Section, a small residential area west of 16th Street roughly between Swann Street and Florida Avenue. The Strivers' Section was an enclave of upper-middle-class African Americans — often community leaders — in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area includes a row of houses on 17th Street owned by Frederick Douglass and occupied by his son. It takes its name from a turn-of-the-century writer who described the district as ""the Striver's section, a community of Negro aristocracy"". The area, which was once considered an overlap of the Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods, is today a historic district. Many of its buildings are the original Edwardian-era residences, along with several apartment and condominium buildings and a few small businesses. Landmarks. Traffic circle. The neighborhood is centered around the traffic circle, which is divided between two counterclockwise roads. The outer road serves all the intersecting streets, while access to the inner road is limited to through traffic on Massachusetts Avenue. Connecticut Avenue passes under the circle via a tunnel; vehicles on Connecticut Avenue can access the circle via service roads that branch from Connecticut near N Street and R Street. The park located within the circle is maintained by the National Park Service. The central fountain designed by Daniel Chester French provides seating, and long, curved benches around the central area were installed in 1964. The park within the circle is a gathering place for those wishing to play chess on the permanent stone chessboards. Tom Murphy, a homeless championship chess player, is a resident. The park has also been the location of political rallies, such as those supporting gay rights and those protesting the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. In 2009, a tug of war was sponsored by the Washington Project for the Arts. In 1999 Thelma Billy was arrested handing out Thanksgiving dinner to the homeless. Embassies. The Dupont Circle neighborhood, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is home to numerous embassies, many of which are located in historic residences. The Thomas T. Gaff House serves as the Colombian ambassador's residence, and the Walsh-McLean House is home to the Indonesian embassy. Located east of Dupont Circle on Massachusetts Avenue is the Clarence Moore House, now known as the Embassy of Uzbekistan, and the Emily J. Wilkins House, which formerly housed the Australian embassy and now is occupied by the Peruvian Chancery. Iraq operates a consular services office in the William J. Boardman House on P Street. Other landmarks. Other landmarks, many of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, include the International Temple, Embassy Gulf Service Station, Christian Heurich Mansion (also known as Brewmaster's Castle), Whittemore House (headquarters to the Woman's National Democratic Club), and the Phillips Collection, the country's first museum of modern art. The Richard H. Townsend House located on Massachusetts Avenue now houses the Cosmos Club. The Dumbarton Bridge, also known as the Buffalo Bridge, carries Q Street over Rock Creek Park and into Georgetown and was constructed in 1883. The Nuns of the Battlefield sculpture, which serves as a tribute to over 600 nuns who nursed soldiers of both armies during the Civil War was erected in 1924. The Mansion on O Street a luxury boutique hotel, private club, events venue and museum has been a fixture in Dupont Circle for over 30 years and includes over 100 rooms and 32 secret doors. The Brickskeller Inn & Bar has long been a popular bar in the neighborhood. Institutions. In addition to its residential components, consisting primarily of high-priced apartments and condominiums, Dupont Circle is home to some of the nation's most prestigious think tanks and research institutions, including the Brookings Institution, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the German Marshall Fund, the Center for Global Development, The Eurasia Center, and the Peterson Institute. The renowned Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of Johns Hopkins is located less than two blocks from the circle. Dupont Circle is also home to the Original Founding Church of Scientology, the first such church established by the religion's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The Phillips Collection, the nation's first museum of modern art, is located near the circle; its most famous and popular work on display is Renoir's giant festive canvas ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"". Additionally, the national headquarters of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, the nation's oldest veterans organization, the National Museum of American Jewish Military History, the Laogai Museum and the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center are also located in Dupont Circle. Annual neighborhood events. Capital Pride. Capital Pride is an annual LGBT pride festival held each June in Washington. , the festival is the fourth-largest LGBT pride event in the United States, with over 200,000 people in attendance. The Capital Pride parade takes place annually on Saturday during the festival and travels through the streets of the neighborhood. High Heel Race. Held annually since 1986, the Dupont Circle High Heel Race takes place on the Tuesday before Halloween (October 31). The race pits dozens of drag queens against each other in a sprint down 17th Street NW between R Street and Church Street, a distance of about three short blocks. The event attracts thousands of spectators and scores of participants, who begin the festivities in late afternoon; the race proper starts at 9 p.m. and lasts a few minutes. The event is sponsored by the nonprofit Dupont Circle Main Streets and by JR's DC Bar and Grill. References. Notes Further reading "
wikipedia-363553," Louisiana State University in Shreveport  Louisiana State University in Shreveport (LSU Shreveport or LSUS) is a branch institution of the Louisiana State University System located in Shreveport, Louisiana. LSUS opened in 1967 as a two-year community college but transitioned into a four-year college five years later in 1972. With an enrollment of 4,535 students, LSUS is a multipurpose system of higher education, accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Although the University does not provide on-campus housing, University Court is contracted by the University to provide apartment-style housing adjacent to the northwest corner of campus for LSUS students. The school's athletic programs, nicknamed the Pilots, are members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the Red River Athletic Conference. LSUS offers more than 70 extra-curricular organizaitons. LSUS operates Red River Radio, a public radio network based in Shreveport. History. Since opening in 1967, LSUS has become the regional urban comprehensive university in the Shreveport-Bossier metropolitan area. Anchored along the picturesque Red River in southeast Shreveport, the LSUS campus serves as home to approximately 4,500 students. LSUS has more than 26 undergraduate degree programs and a dozen master's degree programs. Beginning in January of 2014, LSUS will offer the first doctoral program on its campus, a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Leadership Studies. (pending SACS level change approval) Academics. LSUS offers 26 undergraduate programs,11 Master's degrees and one Doctoral degree. All of LSUS' business degrees are accredited by AACSB-International. LSUS offers many night courses, catering to its non-traditional student population. LSUS also offers many on-line course and two 100% online Master's degrees (Master of Science in Human Services Administration and Master of Health Administration).  The University has a student-teacher ratio of 21:1 and 78% of the professors have doctoral degrees. Many of LSUS' professors have been published and nationally recognized. Many of LSUS' professors sit on nationally-recognized boards related to their disciplines. Athletics. LSU Shreveport (LSUS) teams are known as the Pilots. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing in their second stint as a member of the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC). The Pilots formerly competed in the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) from 2003-2010. Men's sports include baseball, basketball and cross country; while women's sports include basketball, cross country and tennis. The LSUS Athletic program has produced many championship teams collecting a total of seven regular season conference titles, 14 conference tournament championships and competed in 25 NAIA National Tournaments. BASEBALL: Program began in 1991 Conference Regular Season Titles: 2005, 2011, 2012 Conference Tournament Titles: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 NAIA Opening Round Appearances (Regional Tournaments): 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 NAIA Opening Round Titles: 2011, 2012 Avista-NAIA World Series Appearances: 2003, 2011, 2012 The LSU Shreveport Pilot baseball team has become a NAIA National power holding the nation's no. 1 ranking during their record year with a 54-6 record in 2012. The Pilots have been to the Avista-NAIA World series three times under former Head Coach Rocke Musgraves (2000-2013). Musgraves led the Pilots to a fourth place finish (2011) and a pair of third place finishes (2003 & 2012). The program has had many players sign professional contracts and drafted in the Major League Baseball Draft, including three taken in the 2010 MLB Draft. MEN'S BASKETBALL: Program was reinstated in 2003 Conference Regular Season Titles: 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010 Conference Tournament Titles: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 NAIA National Tournament Appearances: 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 NAIA Fab Four Appearances: 2013 Former LSU Shreveport Head Coach Chad McDowell put the Pilots on the NAIA map leading them on the hardwood for an impressive record of 239-62 through his 10 seasons. Coach Kyle Blankenship guided the Pilots to their first ever Fab Four Appearance on the national stage finishing with a 27-7 record in his first year at the helm. WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Program was reinstated in 2003 NAIA National Tournament Appearances: 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 Head Coach Ronnie Howell has been the only one to lead the Lady Pilots since their reinstatement in 2003. Under his leadership the Lady Pilots have made significant improvements on the hardwood notching five straight winning seasons including 20+ win seasons in four of the last five seasons.

CROSS COUNTRY: The LSUS men's and women's cross country squads will begin their first season of competition in the fall of 2013 as a member of the Red River Athletic Conference. Mascot. Pete the Pilot was introduced to students in the fall of 2007 after a process that began in 2005 with the passage of a bill calling for a new mascot by the Student Government Association (SGA). The idea initially met resistance by the administration based upon cost, but was further pursued. He is a combination of steamboat pilot and pelican, which is the state bird of Louisiana. Students offered naming suggestions during student government elections in 2007, with a final decision made by a committee of students and faculty. The committee was composed of the Professor of the Year, the current SGA president, and a former SGA president representing the students, alumni and faculty of LSUS. The mascot was named in accordance with the majority opinion of students expressed during the vote. "
wikipedia-363559," Pancreatic cancer  Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the pancreas. The most common type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 95% of these tumors, is adenocarcinoma (tumors exhibiting glandular architecture on light microscopy) arising within the exocrine component of the pancreas. A minority arise from islet cells, and are classified as neuroendocrine tumors. The signs and symptoms that eventually lead to the diagnosis depend on the location, the size, and the tissue type of the tumor, and may include abdominal pain, lower back pain, and jaundice (if the tumor compresses the bile duct). Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the eighth worldwide. Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis: for all stages combined, the 1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 25% and 6%, respectively; for local disease the 5-year survival is approximately 15% Signs and symptoms. Early pancreatic cancer often does not cause symptoms, and the later symptoms are usually nonspecific and varied. Therefore, pancreatic cancer is often not diagnosed until it is advanced. Common symptoms include: Risk factors. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer may include: Alcohol. It is controversial whether alcohol consumption is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association. Although drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis associated with alcohol consumption is less frequently a precursor for pancreatic cancer than other types of chronic pancreatitis. Some studies suggest a relationship, the risk increasing with increasing amount of alcohol intake. The risk is greatest in heavy drinkers, mostly on the order of four or more drinks per day. There appears to be no increased risk for people consuming up to 30g of alcohol a day, which is approximately 2 alcoholic beverages/day, so most people who take alcohol do so at a level that ""is probably not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer"". A pooled analysis concluded, ""Our findings are consistent with a modest increase in risk of pancreatic cancer with consumption of 30 or more grams of alcohol per day"". Several studies caution that their findings could be due to confounding factors. Even if a link exists, it ""could be due to the contents of some alcoholic beverages"" other than the alcohol itself. One Dutch study even found that drinkers of white wine had lower risk. Diagnosis. Most patients with pancreatic cancer experience pain, weight loss, or jaundice. Pain is present in 80% to 85% of patients with locally advanced or advanced metastatic disease. The pain is usually felt in the upper abdomen as a dull ache that radiates straight through to the back. It may be intermittent and made worse by eating. Weight loss can be profound; it can be associated with anorexia, early satiety, diarrhoea, or steatorrhea. Jaundice is often accompanied by pruritus and dark urine. Painful jaundice is present in approximately one-half of patients with locally unresectable disease, while painless jaundice is present in approximately one-half of patients with a potentially resectable and curable lesion. The initial presentation varies according to location of the cancer. Malignancies in the pancreatic body or tail usually present with pain and weight loss, while those in the head of the gland typically present with steatorrhea, weight loss, and jaundice. The recent onset of atypical diabetes mellitus, a history of recent but unexplained thrombophlebitis (Trousseau sign), or a previous attack of pancreatitis are sometimes noted. Courvoisier sign defines the presence of jaundice and a painlessly distended gallbladder as strongly indicative of pancreatic cancer, and may be used to distinguish pancreatic cancer from gallstones. Tiredness, irritability and difficulty eating because of pain also exist. Pancreatic cancer is often discovered during the course of the evaluation of aforementioned symptoms. Liver function tests can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity. When a cutoff above 37 U/mL is used, this marker has a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 87% in discerning benign from malignant disease. CA 19-9 might be normal early in the course, and could be elevated because of benign causes of biliary obstruction. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT scan) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used to identify the location and form of the cancer. The definitive diagnosis is made by an endoscopic needle biopsy or surgical excision of the radiologically suspicious tissue. Endoscopic ultrasound is often used to visually guide the needle biopsy procedure. Nonetheless, pancreatic cancer is usually staged using a CT scan. In fact, a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for resection of the tumor, rather histologic analysis helps determine which chemotherapeutic regimen to start. Pathophysiology. The development of pancreatic cancer may involve the over-expression of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or the deregulation of various signaling proteins. Mutations leading to carcinoma may be accelerated by genetic or environmental factors and other risk factors already described. Specific mutations vary among and even within the cyto-histologic categories discussed below. Exocrine pancreas cancers. The most common form of pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. Pancreatic cancer has an immunohistochemical profile that is similar to hepatobiliary cancers (e.g. cholangiocarcinoma) and some stomach cancers; thus, it may not always be possible to be certain that a tumour found in the pancreas arose from it. The genetic events that cause ductal adenocarcinoma have been well characterized. The most common are KRAS mutations (96%), CDKN2A mutations/deletions (75%), TP53 mutations (55%), SMAD4 deletions/mutations (50%), and SWI/SNF mutations/deletions (35%). Pancreatic carcinoma is thought to arise from progressive tissue changes. Three types of precancerous lesion are recognised: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia – a microscopic lesions of the pancreas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms both of which are macroscopic lesions. The cellular origin of these lesions is debated. The second most common type of exocrine pancreas cancer is mucinous. The prognosis is slightly better.  Other exocrine cancers include adenosquamous carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, hepatoid carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms are a broad group of pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Endocrine pancreatic tumors have been variously called islet cell tumors, pancreas endocrine tumors (PETs), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). The annual clinically recognized incidence is low, about five per one million person-years. However, autopsy studies incidentally identify PETs in up to 1.5% most of which would remain inert and asymptomatic. The majority of PNETs are usually categorized as benign but the definition of malignancy in pancreas endocrine tumors has been ambiguous. A small subset of endocrine pancreatic tumors are incontrovertible pancreatic endocrine cancers, that make up about 1% of pancreas cancers. Low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the pancreas may be called islet cell tumors. Some sources have also termed these pancreatic carcinoid, a practice that has sometimes been strongly condemned. Definitional migration has caused some complexity of PNET classification, which has adversely affected what is known about the epidemiology and natural history of these tumors. It is probable that some of these tumors have been included in  ICD-O-3 histology classifications 8240–8245, in that they were labeled pancreatic carcinoid tumours but most islet cell carcinomas have been coded as ICD-O-3 system 8150–8155. The more aggressive endocrine pancreatic cancers are known as pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (PNEC). Similarly, there has likely been a degree of admixture of PNEC and extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma. Prevention. According to the American Cancer Society, there are no established guidelines for preventing pancreatic cancer, although cigarette smoking has been reported as responsible for 20–30% of pancreatic cancers. The ACS recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing red meat intake, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. In 2006, a large prospective cohort study of over 80,000 subjects failed to prove a definite association. The evidence in support of this lies mostly in small case-control studies. A long-term study found that people who consumed in the range of 300 to 449 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily had a 43% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those who took less than 150 IU per day; 150 IU is appreciably less than what was then, or is now, recommended. The World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there were insufficient studies in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, while the IARC found evidence for an inverse association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer to be persuasive, it found evidence for a causal link to be limited, and also found that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were inconclusive. Taking too much vitamin D may be harmful. Poor general diet, obesity, and relative physical inactivity can be risk factors in some cancers, so the role of vitamin D itself is not certain. A Harvard study from 2007 showed a modest inverse trend between blood circulation of B vitamins, such as B12, B6, and folate and pancreatic cancer incidence, but not when the vitamins were ingested in tablet form. However, the results of a meta-analysis of randomized trials by Rothwell and colleagues indicate that taking a daily low-dose aspirin regimen for more than five years decreases the risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ductal pancreatic cancer) by 75%. Screening. People who may have a high risk of pancreatic cancer due to a family history can be followed, but there is no consensus on what constitutes optimal monitoring. Several small studies have shown promising preliminary results for new biomarkers, but further validation on a larger scale is needed. People with pancreatic cancer themselves, or family members, may wish to participate in the activities at a research facility, or identify a pancreas tumor registry. A possible 'dipstick screen', developed by 15-year-old Jack Andraka with the collaboration of Johns Hopkins University, detects the level of a protein called mesothelin in the urine or blood, which is a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Experts believe it stands a chance of becoming a cheap test for the disease but will take years to develop. Treatment. Exocrine pancreas cancer. Surgery. Treatment of pancreatic cancer depends on the stage of the cancer. Although only localized cancer is considered suitable for surgery with curative intent at present, only 20% of cases present with localised disease at diagnosis. Surgery can also be performed for palliation, if the malignancy is invading or compressing the duodenum or colon. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure. The Whipple procedure is the most common attempted curative surgical treatment for cancers involving the head of the pancreas. This procedure involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together (pancreato-duodenectomy), making a bypass for food from stomach to jejunum (gastro-jejunostomy) and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile (cholecysto-jejunostomy). It can be performed only if the patient is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed in only the minority of cases. Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy. Recently, localized cancers of the pancreas have been resected using minimally invasive (laparoscopic) approaches. After surgery, ""adjuvant"" chemotherapy with gemcitabine has been shown in several large randomized studies to significantly increase the 5-year survival (from approximately 10 to 20%), and should be offered if the patient is fit after surgery (Oettle et al. JAMA 2007, Neoptolemos et al. NEJM 2004, Oettle et al. ASCO proc 2007). Those with inoperable pancreatic cancer may have significant abdominal pain. A celiac plexus block (CPB), which destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen, is a safe and effective way to reduce the pain. CPB generally reduces the need to use pain killers like opioids, which have significant negative side effects. Radiation. Principles of radiation therapy in pancreas adenocarcinoma are reviewed extensively in guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Radiation can be considered in several situations. One situation is the addition of radiation therapy after potentially curative surgery. Groups in the US have been more apt to use adjuvant radiation therapy than groups in Europe. Chemotherapy. In patients not suitable for resection with curative intent, palliative chemotherapy may be used to improve quality of life and gain a modest survival benefit. Gemcitabine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1998, after a clinical trial reported improvements in quality of life and a 5-week improvement in median survival duration in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. This marked the first FDA approval of a chemotherapy drug primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint. Gemcitabine is administered intravenously on a weekly basis. A Canadian-led Phase III randomised controlled trial, reported in 2005, involved 569 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, led the US FDA in 2005 to license erlotinib (Tarceva) in combination with gemcitabine as a palliative regimen for pancreatic cancer. This trial compared the outcome of gemcitabine/erlotinib to gemcitabine/placebo, and demonstrated improved survival rates, improved tumor response and improved progression-free survival rates. Other trials are now investigating the effect of the above combination in the adjuvant (post surgery) and neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) settings. Addition of oxaliplatin to Gemcitabine (Gem/Ox) was shown to confer benefit in small trials, but is not yet standard therapy. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The majority of these tumors are histologically benign. Treatment of pancreatic endocrine tumors, including the less common malignant tumors, may include: Prognosis. [[Image:Pancreas cancer world map - Death - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Age-standardized death from pancreatic cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.  Exocrine pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma and less common variants) typically has a poor prognosis, partly because the cancer usually causes no symptoms early on, leading to locally advanced or metastatic disease at time of diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer may occasionally result in diabetes. Insulin production is hampered, and it has been suggested the cancer can also prompt the onset of diabetes and vice versa. It can be associated with pain, fatigue, weight loss, jaundice, and weakness. Additional symptoms are discussed above. For pancreatic cancer: Outcomes with pancreatic endocrine tumors, many of which are benign and completely without clinical symptoms, are much better, as are outcomes with symptomatic benign tumors; even with actual pancreatic endocrine cancers, outcomes are rather better, but variable. Epidemiology. Globally, as of 2010, pancreatic cancer resulted in 310,000 deaths up from 200,000 in 1990. In 2010, an estimated 43,000 people in the US were diagnosed with pancreas cancer and almost 37,000 died from the disease. Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest fatality rates of all cancers, and is the fourth-highest cancer killer among both men and women worldwide. Although it accounts for only 2.5% of new cases, pancreatic cancer is responsible for 6% of cancer deaths each year. "
wikipedia-363594," University of Melbourne  The University of Melbourne (commonly referred to as Melbourne University, Melbourne and UniMelb) is an Australian public university located in Melbourne, Victoria. Founded in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria. Commonly considered to be Australia's most prestigious university, Melbourne is currently ranked as Australia's best university by Times Higher Education, Academic Ranking of World Universities and National Taiwan University Rankings. Times Higher Education currently ranks Melbourne as 28th in the world, while the QS World University Rankings places Melbourne 31st in the world. Melbourne's main campus is located in Parkville, an inner suburb north of the Melbourne central business district, with several other campuses located across Victoria. Melbourne is a sandstone university and a member of the Group of Eight, Universitas 21 and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. It claims it has the largest endowment and the largest research expenditure of any Australian university. Since 1872 various residential colleges have become affiliated with the university. There are currently 12 colleges located on the main campus and in nearby suburbs offering academic, sporting and cultural programs alongside accommodation for Melbourne students and faculty.  Melbourne comprises 11 separate academic units and is associated with numerous institutes and research centres, including the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and the Grattan Institute. Amongst Melbourne's 15 graduate schools the Melbourne Business School, the Melbourne Law School and the Melbourne Medical School are particularly well regarded. Four Australian prime ministers and five governors-general have graduated from Melbourne. Seven Nobel laureates have been students or faculty, the most of any Australian university. Arms. The university's coat of arms is a blue shield on which a depiction of ""Victory"" in white colour holds her laurel wreath over the stars of the Southern Cross. The motto, ""Postera crescam laude"" (""Later I shall grow by praise"" or, more freely, ""We shall grow in the esteem of future generations""), is written on a scroll beneath the shield. The Latin is from a line in a Horace ode: ""ego postera crescam laude recens"". History. Melbourne University was established by Hugh Childers, the Auditor-General and Finance Minister, in his first Budget Speech on 4 November 1852, who set aside a sum of £10,000 for the establishment of a university. The university was established by Act of Incorporation on 22 January 1853, with power to confer degrees in arts, medicine, laws and music. The act provided for an annual endowment of £9,000, while a special grant of £20.000 was made for buildings that year. The foundation stone was laid on 3 July 1854, and on the same day the foundation stone for the State Library Classes commenced in 1855 with three professors and sixteen students; of this body of students, only four graduated. The original buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, on 3 October 1855. The first chancellor, Redmond Barry (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880. The inauguration of the university was made possible by the wealth resulting from Victoria's gold rush. The institution was designed to be a ""civilising influence"" at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth. In 1881, the admission of women was a seen as victory over the more conservative ruling council. The university's 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2003. Governance. Governance of the university is grounded in an act of parliament, the Melbourne University Act 2009. The peak governing body is the ""Council"" the key responsibilities of which include appointing the Vice Chancellor and Principal, approving the strategic direction and annual budget, establishing operational policies and procedures and overseeing academic and commercial activities as well as risk management. The chair of the council is the ""Chancellor"". The ""Academic Board"" oversees learning, teaching and research activities and provides advice to the council on these matters. The ""Committee of Convocation"" represents graduates and its members are elected in proportion to the number of graduates in each faculty. Endowment. In 2008, the university had an endowment of approximately $1.105 billion, the largest of any Australian institution. Whilst the fund had grown rapidly for several years, providing up to $100 million of income per year, it shrank by 22% in 2008 as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis of 2007–2010. However Australian endownments are relatively small compared with those of the wealthiest US universities. Academia. The university has 12 academic units, some of which incorporate a graduate school. The overall attrition and retention rates at the university are the lowest and highest respectively in Australia. The university has one of the highest admission requirements in the country, with the median ENTER of its undergraduates being 94.05 (2009). Furthermore, The university continued to attract outstanding students, for example, 50% of the Premier's VCE Top All-Round High Achievers enrolled at the University of Melbourne. According to the Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings (2009), Melbourne is the only Australian university to rank in the top 30 in all ﬁve core subject areas with three subject areas ranked in the top 20. Research. Melbourne University claims that its research expenditure is second only to that of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). In 2010 the university spent $813 million on research. In the same year the university had the highest numbers of federal government Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA) and International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS)as well as the largest totals of Research Higher Degree (RHD) student load (3,222 students) and RHD completions (715). Campus. Residential colleges. Melbourne University has 12 residential colleges in total, seven of the which are located in an arc around the cricket oval at the northern edge of the campus, known as College Crescent. The other five are located outside of university grounds. The residential colleges aim to provide accommodation and holistic education experience to university students. Architecture. Several of the earliest campus buildings, such as the Old Quadrangle and Baldwin Spencer buildings, feature period architecture. The new Wilson Hall replaced the original building which was destroyed by fire. Libraries. The Melbourne University Library has three million visitors performing 42 million loan transactions every year. The general collection comprises over 3.5 million items including books, DVDs, photographic slides, music scores and periodicals as well as rare maps, prints and other published materials. The library also holds over 32,000 e-books, hundreds of databases and 63,000 general and specialist journals in digital form. The libraries include: Other campuses. The university has four other campuses in metropolitan Melbourne at Burnley, Southbank, Hawthorn and Werribee.  The Burnley campus is where horticultural courses are taught. Performing arts courses are taught at the Southbank campus. Commerce courses are taught at the Hawthorn campus. Veterinary science is taught at the Werribee campus. In regional Victoria, the Creswick and Dookie campuses are used for forestry and agriculture courses respectively. They previously housed several hundred residential students, but are now largely used for short courses and research. The Shepparton campus is home to the Rural Health Academic Centre for the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences. The university is a part-owner of the Melbourne Business School, based at Parkville campus, which ranked 46th in the 2012 ""Financial Times"" global rankings. Arts and culture. The university is associated with several arts institutions in the wider community. These include: ""Melbourne Model"". In 2008, the ""Melbourne Model"" was introduced.  In 2007, Melbourne University aimed to offer 75% of graduate places as HECS (with the remaining 25% being full fee paying). Professional-entry masters degrees. A number of professional degrees are available only for graduate entry. These degrees are at a masters level according to the Australian Qualification Framework, but are named ""masters"" or ""doctorate"" following the practice in North America. The professional degrees are: Reaction to the ""Melbourne Model"". Various groups, including trade and student unions, VCA merger and controversy. As of May 2009 the university ""suspended"" the Bachelor of Music Theatre and Puppetry courses at the college and there were fears they may not return under the new curriculum. A 2005 heads of agreement over the merger of the VCA and the university stated that the management of academic programs at the VCA would ensure that ""the VCA continues to exercise high levels of autonomy over the conduct and future development of its academic programs so as to ensure their integrity and quality"" and also that the college's identity will be preserved. New dean Sharman Pretty outlined drastic changes under the university's plan for the college in early April 2009. As a result it is now being called into question whether the university have upheld that agreement. Staff at the college responded to the changes, claiming the university did not value vocational arts training, and voicing fears over the future of quality training at the VCA. Former Victorian arts minister Race Mathews has also weighed in on the debate expressing his hope that, ""Melbourne University will not proceed with its proposed changes to the Victorian College of the Arts,"" and for 'good sense' to prevail. Rankings. The following is a summary of Melbourne University rankings, numbers in parentheses indicate ranking within Australia: The university was ranked 31st in the 2011 QS World University Rankings. and in 2008 was ranked 58th globally for scientific papers by the Higher Edutcation Evaluations and Accreditation Council of Taiwan Research produced by the Melbourne Institute in 2006 ranked Australian universities across seven main discipline areas: arts and humanities; business and economics; education; engineering; law; medicine; and science, with Melbourne University as the highest in business, law and medicine by both academic surveys and overall performance. In 2010 the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), ranked Melbourne Uni 40th globally and highest in Australia. Notably, in 2013 the University of Melbourne's Medicine course was ranked 9th in the world, the first time an Australian University has been ranked in the top 10 medicine schools  Notable graduates. The University of Melbourne has produced many notable alumni, with graduates having held the offices of Prime Ministers of Australia, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Governor-General, Attorney-General, Governor of Victoria, High Court Justices, State Premiers, Nobel Laureates, a First Lady of East Timor, ministers of foreign countries, Lord Mayors, academics, architects, historians, poets, philosophers, politicians, scientists, physicists, authors, industry leaders, Defence Force generals, corporate leaders and artists. The University of Melbourne is well known for its strong physics department, boasting the most number of noble prize winners (two) in any department within Australia Student activities. ""Prosh Week"". A celebrated tradition at Melbourne is usually held in mid-August in which teams of students engage in various activities - the winner claiming the ""Prosh Week Trophy"". The week was nicknamed 'Posh week' due to the number of times students would have to dress up in formal attire. The effects of alcohol caused words to be slurred, and thus 'posh' became 'prosh'. Sport. The university has participated in various sports in its history and currently has 39 affiliated clubs. Sport is overseen by Melbourne University Sport. Lacrosse. The Melbourne University Lacrosse Club (MULC) was established in 1883 and is the oldest continually operational lacrosse club in the world. Cycling. The Melbourne University Cycling Club (MUCyc) is associated with Cycling Australia and competes regularly at local and national races. In 2008 MUCyc won its seventh consecutive AUG championship (2002–2008). "
wikipedia-363601," Lina Medina  Lina Medina (born September 27, 1933, in Ticrapo, Huancavelica Region, Peru) is the youngest confirmed mother in medical history, giving birth at the age of five years, seven months and 17 days. She currently lives in Lima, the capital of Peru. Early development. Born in Ticrapo, Peru, to silversmith Tiburelo Medina and Victoria Losea, Medina was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of five years due to increasing abdominal size. She was originally thought to have had a tumor, but her doctors determined she was in her seventh month of pregnancy. Dr. Gerardo Lozada took her to Lima, Peru, before the surgery to have other specialists confirm that Medina was pregnant. Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that interest in the case developed on many fronts. The ""San Antonio Light"" newspaper reported in its July 16, 1939, edition—in anticipation of the girl's expected visit to university scientific facilities in the United States—that a national Peruvian obstetrician/midwife association had demanded before the birth that the girl be transported to a national maternity hospital and quoted April 18 reports in the Peruvian paper ""La Crónica"" stating that a North American filmmaking concern sent a representative ""with authority to offer the sum of $5000 to benefit the minor exchange for filming rights ... we know that the offer was rejected."" The same article, reprinted from a Chicago paper, noted that Dr. Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them around April 21 while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine; on a subsequent visit to visit Lina's remote hometown, some of the baggage carrying the films had been dropped into the river while crossing ""a very primitive bridge"": ""Enough of his pictorial record remained, however, to intrigue the learned savants."" A month and a half after the original diagnosis, on May 14, 1939, Medina gave birth to a boy by a caesarean section necessitated by her small pelvis. The surgery was performed by Dr. Lozada and Dr. Busalleu, with Dr. Colareta providing anaesthesia. Her case was reported in detail by Dr. Edmundo Escomel in the medical journal ""La Presse Médicale"", including the additional details that her menarche had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to a past report stating that she had been having regular periods since she was three years old (or 2½ according to a different article). The report also detailed that she had prominent breast development by the age of four. By age five, her figure displayed pelvic widening and advanced bone maturation. When doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs from precocious puberty. Her son. Medina's son weighed at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. Gerardo was raised believing that Medina was his sister, but found out at the age of 10 that she was his mother. He grew up healthy but died in 1979 at the age of 40 of a bone marrow disease. Later life. Medina has never revealed the father of the child nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Dr. Escomel suggested she might not actually know herself by writing that Medina ""couldn't give precise responses"". Although Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of child sexual abuse, he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the biological father who impregnated Lina was never identified. Additionally, there was no explanation of how a five-year-old girl could conceive a child. In young adulthood, she worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Dr. Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school. Medina later married Raúl Jurado, who fathered her second son in 1972. , they lived in a poor district of Lima known as ""Chicago Chico"" (""Little Chicago""). She refused an interview with Reuters that year, just as she had turned away many reporters in years past. Documentation. There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven and a half months into pregnancy. Taken from Medina's left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. This is the only published photograph of Lina taken during her pregnancy. This photograph is of significant value because it documents her condition and the extent of her physiological development. The other photograph is of far greater clarity and was taken a year later in Lima when Gerardo was eleven months old. Although the case was called a hoax by some, a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on biopsies, X rays of the fetal skeleton ""in utero"", and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her. Extreme precocious puberty in children 5 or under is very uncommon; pregnancy and delivery by a child this young remains extremely rare. Extreme precocious puberty is treated to suppress fertility, preserve growth potential, and reduce the social consequences of full sexual development in childhood. "
wikipedia-363604," Mario Party 5  The game is set in the fictional world of the Dream Depot, consisting of seven game boards. The single-player ""Story"" mode involves the player winning multiple games against the Koopa Kids to prevent Bowser from conquering the Dream Depot. The main multiplayer game mode consists of four characters from ""Mario"" series playing a board game, with each board having a set theme. The game also features several minigames, which are played after every set of turns. ""Mario Party 5"" introduces the ""Super Duel"" mode to the franchise, which requires players to assemble and control custom made battle vehicles which can be used in combat against other machines. The game features ten playable characters, with playable debuts to the series from Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. ""Mario Party 5"" was positively received by the media; reviewers enjoyed the new minigames of the series, although a perceived lack of originality was criticized. The game became part of the Nintendo Player's Choice label in 2004, and won the Console Children's Award at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. ""Mario Party 5"" received an aggregate rating of 71% from Game Rankings and 69% from Metacritic. ""Mario Party 5"" is followed by ""Mario Party 6"". Gameplay. ""Mario Party 5"" retains the fundamental gameplay featured in previous installments, which is based upon a themed board game played by characters of the ""Mario"" series. The player's objective is to obtain the most stars by the end of the board game, which are usually purchased when landing on the designated star space on the game board. Coins are earned mainly by winning minigames, which occur after all players have rolled the die. ""Party Mode"" is the main multiplayer mode, and involves four characters competing in a standard board game either independently or in opposing pairs. As with its predecessors, players can adjust the number of turns in a game by multiples of five, and determine the difficulty of artificial intelligence opponents. ""Mario Party 5"" features ten playable characters, including three additional characters to the series: Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Hudson omitted Donkey Kong as a playable character from the series in this installment, instead featuring him in the ""DK space"", which initiates an event granting the possibility of a star or coins whenever landed on. While the series' predecessors used item shops as a means to obtain items, ""Mario Party 5"" introduces the capsule system. Capsules are containers that hold a single item which are acquired when passing the ""Capsule Machine"" on the board. The items contained within them serve a variety of purposes, from increasing the range of the die and thus movement, to deducting ten coins from an opponent. The capsules can only be thrown up to ten spaces ahead of the current position. During a game, the gameplay is altered for the last five turns with the options selected randomly via a roulette wheel; such changes include tripling the coin benefit or deficit from coloured spaces. The game's boards incorporate the theme of the Dream Depot, with each having ""Dream"" at the end of the board's title, except for the ""Bowser's Nightmare"" board. Each board consists of multiple types of spaces, some of which granting special types of minigames that cannot be accessed regularly. Some spaces, specifically ""happening"" spaces, will incorporate the relevant theme; for example, a giant robot resembling Mecha Bowser will shoot any character back to the start when landing on its ""happening"" space in the Toy Dream board. Players can choose to play minigames separate from the board game context via ""Minigame Mode"". The minigames are categorized by their character structure, with ""4-player"", ""1 vs. 3"", and ""2 vs. 2"" available. Besides these standard versions, there are also the ""DK"" and ""Bowser"" minigames, which are themed to reflect their titular character; ""Battle"" minigames are retained from ""Mario Party 4"". The set of minigames are available without a structure (""Free play"") in this mode, but can be formatted into tournaments and separate objectives like in ""Mini-game circuit"", involving the characters winning minigames to reach the finish line first. In ""Bonus mode"", a set of three larger games that do not appear in usual play can be accessed; this involves a card-based board game (""Card party""), as well as Beach volleyball and Ice hockey. ""Mario Party 5 ""introduced the ""Super-Duel Mode"", a game involving the player assembling and controlling a combat vehicle. Each component of the vehicle can be bought separately; these do not necessarily have to fit with other parts stylistically, and contribute to the vehicle's general statistics regarding fields such as health and speed. Once the vehicle is assembled and named, it can engage AI or human opponents in a single match or in tournaments. Variants of this are available, including a capture the flag mode and another requiring the player to shoot mechanical rabbits. Plot and Setting. The story mode in ""Mario Party 5"" is completely different than the story modes of ""Mario Party 3"" and ""Mario Party 4"". Players face three Koopa Kids (red, green, and blue). The only way to defeat them and clear the board is to take all their coins away, mostly by beating them in minigames. Players must take all coins from a Koopa Kid to defeat it. If players lose all of the coins or don't defeat the Koopa Kids within fifteen turns, the game is over. After players win five boards, they face Bowser in a final stage mini-game called ""Frightmare,"" in which it is a one-on-one mini-game with Bowser. There are four parts to the battle. First, players go against Mechakoopas (Robotic versions of Koopa Troopas). Next, players have to move and jump around to avoid three rings of fire for a short time. Then players face Bowser directly. Make him jump onto a tile three times to clear the third part. The final part of the minigame is the final battle, where Bowser grows. After throwing fireballs and hitting Bowser with them five times, the game is cleared and the final board unlocked. Development. Like its predecessors, ""Mario Party 5"" was published by Nintendo and developed by Hudson Soft. It is the first Mario Party game to have Donkey Kong as a non-playable character. It is also the first Mario Party game to have Wario wearing his current short-sleeve shirt. It's also the last Mario Party game to have Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Daisy, Waluigi, Toad, Boo, Koopa Kid, Donkey Kong, and Bowser to have voice clips from the previous Mario Party game. It is the last Mario Party game where Daisy is voiced by Jen Taylor; for later games, Jen Taylor is replaced by Deanna Mustard.  Nintendo first unveiled the game at the E3 conference of 2003, where eight mini-games were available in a playable demonstration. Following release, Nintendo announced ""Mario Party 5"" as a ""Player's Choice"" title, which is a label for Nintendo titles that had sold more than one million copies to be sold at a bargain price. ""Super Mario Fushigi no Korokoro Party"" ""Super Mario: The Mysterious Rolling Party"" is an arcade version of ""Mario Party 5"" released exclusively in Japan in 2004. It was developed by Capcom instead of Hudson Soft. Reception. ""Mario Party 5"" received mixed to positive reviews, although there were frequent criticisms of the game's perceived dependency on luck rather than skill. ""Game Informer""s Andrew Reiner cited the example of coin redistribution in the game, which meant that ""You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place"", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Scheider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini Bowsers, who all take their turns at the same time in ""Story"" mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note ""If you bought ""Mario Party 4"" last year, ""Mario Party 5"" is hard to recommend."", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in ""Mario Party 5"", although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that ""the sheer volume can keep you compelled. If only you didn't have to deal with all that BS in-between"" when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.  Features introduced in the game received a mixed response. The three games in ""Bonus"" mode were praised, although reviewers were least enthusiastic about ""Card Party"", with GameSpot commenting that ""This mode is proof that the minigames are really what make Mario Party fun, as it's pretty dull."" The capsule system was generally criticised as the pertaining animations seemed to exacerbate the game's slow place. Despite other reviewers' claims that the capsule system contributed to the game's dependence on chance, IGN commended the system for contributing to a more dynamic game board experience. The ""Super Duel"" mode was praised as a reasonably fun feature, although the gameplay was rated as ""sluggish"". GameSpy noted the seemingly increasing board sizes from previous installments, which apparently made obtaining stars and using ranged items more difficult. The game's graphics received a mediocre response, with GameSpot commenting that the presentation is ""starting to seem a bit antiquated"" when noting that the character models did not seem to have been updated from ""Mario Party 4"". Despite this, IGN commented that ""Mario Party 5"" ""isn't a bad looking game"", noting the level of detail and variety given to the game's board game's and maps. GameSpot noted that the game's audio did fit the game, although they commented that it ""is largely recycled from ""Mario Party 4"""". IGN criticized the ""cheesy"" and unadventurous soundtrack, as well as a lack of voice acting. It won the Console Children's Award at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. "
wikipedia-363607," Bern railway station  Bern railway station () serves the municipality of Bern, the capital city of Switzerland. Opened progressively between 1858 and 1860, and rebuilt several times since then, it forms part of the Olten–Lausanne line (known as the ""Mittellandlinie"" in German) and is near the end of the Lötschberg line. The station is owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS). Train services to and from the station are operated by the Swiss Federal Railways, the Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway (BLS) and the metre gauge Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn (RBS). Trains calling at the station include TGVs, ICEs, and international trains to Italy. Bern is the nearest station to the University of Bern in the Länggasse quarter. There is a shuttle bus to Bern Airport from the station. It has an IATA Airport Code (ZDJ), as American Airlines codeshares on the Swiss Federal Railways service from Zurich International Airport in Zürich.  Between 1999 and 2003, the station was renovated and partially redesigned. It now contains Rail City, a shopping center open longer than the other shops in town, and over the weekend. This is possible as the shop opening laws of the city of Bern do not apply on Swiss Federal Railway property. Services. Long-distance trains. The main long-distance routes served by trains to or from Bern railway station are as follows: Bern S-Bahn trains. , the station was also served by the following Bern S-Bahn routes: "
wikipedia-363627," Participant observation  Participant observation is one type of data collection method typically done in the qualitative research paradigm. It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology, less so in sociology, communication studies, and social psychology. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time. The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronisław Malinowski in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of sociology. History and development. Participant observation was used extensively by Frank Hamilton Cushing in his study of the Zuni Indians in the later part of the nineteenth century, followed by the studies of non-Western societies by people such as Bronisław Malinowski, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, and Margaret Mead in the first half of the twentieth century. It emerged as the principal approach to ethnographic research by anthropologists and relied on the cultivation of personal relationships with local informants as a way of learning about a culture, involving both observing and participating in the social life of a group. By living with the cultures they studied, researchers were able to formulate first hand accounts of their lives and gain novel insights. This same method of study has also been applied to groups within Western society, and is especially successful in the study of sub-cultures or groups sharing a strong sense of identity, where only by taking part may the observer truly get access to the lives of those being studied. The postmortem publication of Grenville Goodwin's decade of work as a participant-observer with the Western Apache, ""The Social Organization of the Western Apache"", established Grenville Goodwin as a prominent figure in the field of ethnology. Since the 1980s, some anthropologists and other social scientists have questioned the degree to which participant observation can give veridical insight into the minds of other people. At the same time, a more formalized qualitative research program known as grounded theory, initiated by Glaser and Strauss, began gaining currency within American sociology and related fields such as public health. In response to these challenges, some ethnographers have refined their methods, either making them more amenable to formal hypothesis-testing and replicability, or framing their interpretations within a more carefully considered epistemology. The development of participant-observation as a research tool has therefore not been a haphazard process, but instead has practiced a great deal of self-criticism and review. It has as a result become specialized. Visual anthropology can be viewed as a subset of methods of participant-observation, as the central questions in that field have to do with how to take a camera into the field, while dealing with such issues as the observer effect. Issues with entry into the field have evolved into a separate subfield. Clifford Geertz's famous essay on how to approach the multi-faceted arena of human action from an observational point of view, in ""Interpretation of Cultures"" uses the simple example of a human wink, perceived in a cultural context far from home. Method and practice. Such research involves a range of well-defined, though variable methods: informal interviews, direct observation, participation in the life of the group, collective discussions, analyses of personal documents produced within the group, self-analysis, results from activities undertaken off or online, and life-histories. Although the method is generally characterized as qualitative research, it can (and often does) include quantitative dimensions. Traditional participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. An extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like taboo behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over extended periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the formal system) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior. In participant observation,a researcher's discipline based interests and commitments shape which events he or she considers are important and relevant to the research inquiry. According to Howell (1972), the four stages that most participant observation research studies are establishing rapport or getting to know the people, immersing oneself in the field, recording data and observations, and consolidating the information gathered. Types of participant observation. Participant observation is not simply showing up at a site and writing things down. On the contrary, participant observation is a complex method that has many components. One of the first things that a researcher or individual must do after deciding to conduct participant observations to gather data is decide what kind of participant observer he or she will be.Spradley provides five different types of participant observations summarised below. '""Participant Observation Type Chart. Limitations To Any Participant Observation Impact of researcher involvement. Participant observation can only do so much for the researcher because the sole presence of the researcher in the field will influence the participants' behavior (see:observer-expectancy effect). Researchers engaging in this type of qualitative research method must be aware that participants may act differently or put up a facade that is in accordance to what they believe the researcher is studying. This is why it is important to employ rigor in any qualitative research study. A useful method of rigor to employ is member-checking or triangulation.  While gathering data through participant observation, investigator triangulation would be a way to ensure that one researcher is not letting his or her biases or personal preferences in the way of observing and recording meaningful experiences. As the name suggests, investigator triangulation involves multiple research team members gathering data about the same event, but this method ensures a variety of recorded observations due to the varying theoretical perspectives of each research team member. In other words, triangulation, be it data, investigator, theory or methodological triangulation, is a form of cross-checking information. Member checking is when the researcher asks for participant feedback on his or her recorded observations to ensure that the researcher is accurately depicting the participants' experiences and the accuracy of conclusions drawn from the data. This method can be used in participant observation studies or when conducting interviews. Member-checking and triangulation are good methods to use when conducting participant observations, or any other form of qualitative research, because they increase data and research conclusion credibility and transferability. In quantitative research, credibility is liken to internal validity, or the knowledge that our findings are representative of reality, and transferability is similar to external validity or the extent to which the findings can be generalized across different populations, methods, and settings. A variant of participant observation is observing participation, described by Marek M. Kaminski, who explored prison subculture as a political prisoner in communist Poland in 1985. ""Observing"" or ""observant"" participation has also been used to describe fieldwork in sexual minority subcultures by anthropologists and sociologists who are themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, as well as amongst political activists and in protest events. The different phrasing is meant to highlight the way in which their partial or full membership in the community/subculture that they are researching both allows a different sort of access to the community and also shapes their perceptions in ways different from a full outsider. This is similar to considerations by anthropologists such as Lila Abu-Lughod on ""halfie anthropology"", or fieldwork by bicultural anthropologists on a culture to which they partially belong. Ethical concerns. As with any forms of research dealing with human subjects, the researcher must ensure the ethical boundaries are never crossed by those conducting the subjects of study. The researcher must have clearly established boundaries before the onset of the study, and have guidelines in place should any issues cross the line of ethical behavior. One of the issues would be if the researcher is studying a population where illegal activities may occur or when working with minor children. In participant observation, the ethical concern that is most salient is that of informed consent and voluntary participation. There is the issue of deciding to obtain informed consent from every individual in the group of study, obtain the informed consent for participant observation from the person of leadership, or not inform anyone of one’s true purpose in fear of influencing the attitudes of members, thus skewing the observations recorded. The decision is based on the nature of the study and the researcher’s own personal thoughts on the cost-benefit ratio of the situation. Participant observation also brings up the issue of voluntary participation in events the researcher observes and records. There may be instances when members do not want to be a part of the study and request that all data collected pertinent to them be removed. In this case, the researcher is obligated to relinquish data that may identify the members in any way. Above anything else, it is the researcher’s responsibility that the participants of the study do not suffer any ill effects directly or indirectly from the study, participants are informed of their rights as subjects of the study, and that the group was justly chosen for study (The Belmont Report). The American Anthropological Association and The American Sociological Association both have comprehensive statements concerning the code of conduct for research. "
wikipedia-363628," Tensor algebra  In mathematics, the tensor algebra of a vector space ""V"", denoted ""T""(""V"") or ""T"" •(""V""), is the algebra of tensors on ""V"" (of any rank) with multiplication being the tensor product. It is the free algebra on ""V"", in the sense of being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from algebras to vector spaces: it is the ""most general"" algebra containing ""V"", in the sense of the corresponding universal property (see below). The tensor algebra also has two coalgebra structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bialgebra, and a more complicated one, which yields a bialgebra, and can be extended with an antipode to a Hopf algebra structure. ""Note"": In this article, all algebras are assumed to be unital and associative. Construction. Let ""V"" be a vector space over a field ""K"". For any nonnegative integer ""k"", we define the ""k""th tensor power of ""V"" to be the tensor product of ""V"" with itself ""k"" times: That is, ""T""""k""""V"" consists of all tensors on ""V"" of rank ""k"". By convention ""T""0""V"" is the ground field ""K"" (as a one-dimensional vector space over itself). We then construct ""T""(""V"") as the direct sum of ""T""""k""""V"" for ""k"" = 0,1,2,… The multiplication in ""T""(""V"") is determined by the canonical isomorphism given by the tensor product, which is then extended by linearity to all of ""T""(""V""). This multiplication rule implies that the tensor algebra ""T""(""V"") is naturally a graded algebra with ""T""""k""""V"" serving as the grade-""k"" subspace. This grading can be extended to a Z grading by appending subspaces formula_4 for negative integers ""k"". The construction generalizes in straightforward manner to the tensor algebra of any module ""M"" over a ""commutative"" ring. If ""R"" is a non-commutative ring, one can still perform the construction for any ""R""-""R"" bimodule ""M"". (It does not work for ordinary ""R""-modules because the iterated tensor products cannot be formed.) Adjunction and universal property. The tensor algebra ""T""(""V"") is also called the free algebra on the vector space ""V"", and is functorial. As with other free constructions, the functor ""T"" is left adjoint to some forgetful functor. In this case, it's the functor which sends each ""K""-algebra to its underlying vector space. Explicitly, the tensor algebra satisfies the following universal property, which formally expresses the statement that it is the most general algebra containing ""V"": Here ""i"" is the canonical inclusion of ""V"" into ""T""(""V"") (the unit of the adjunction). One can, in fact, define the tensor algebra ""T""(""V"") as the unique algebra satisfying this property (specifically, it is unique up to a unique isomorphism), but one must still prove that an object satisfying this property exists. The above universal property shows that the construction of the tensor algebra is ""functorial"" in nature. That is, ""T"" is a functor from the ""K""-Vect, category of vector spaces over ""K"", to ""K""-Alg, the category of ""K""-algebras. The functoriality of ""T"" means that any linear map from ""V"" to ""W"" extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism from ""T""(""V"") to ""T""(""W""). Non-commutative polynomials. If ""V"" has finite dimension ""n"", another way of looking at the tensor algebra is as the ""algebra of polynomials over ""K"" in ""n"" non-commuting variables"". If we take basis vectors for ""V"", those become non-commuting variables (or ""indeterminants"") in ""T""(""V""), subject to no constraints beyond associativity, the distributive law and ""K""-linearity. Note that the algebra of polynomials on ""V"" is not formula_5, but rather formula_6: a (homogeneous) linear function on ""V"" is an element of formula_7 for example coordinates formula_8 on a vector space are covectors, as they take in a vector and give out a scalar (the given coordinate of the vector). Quotients. Because of the generality of the tensor algebra, many other algebras of interest can be constructed by starting with the tensor algebra and then imposing certain relations on the generators, i.e. by constructing certain quotient algebras of ""T""(""V""). Examples of this are the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, Clifford algebras and universal enveloping algebras. Coalgebra structures. The tensor algebra has two coalgebra structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bialgebra, and a more complicated one, which yields a bialgebra, and can be extended with an antipode to a Hopf algebra structure. Simple coalgebra structure. The simple coalgebra structure on the tensor algebra is given as follows. The coproduct Δ is defined by extended by linearity to all of ""TV"". The counit is given by Note that Δ : ""TV"" → ""TV"" ⊗ ""TV"" respects the grading and ε is also compatible with the grading. The tensor algebra is ""not"" a bialgebra with this coproduct. Bialgebra and Hopf algebra structure. However, the following more complicated coproduct does yield a bialgebra: where the summation is taken over all (p,m-p)-shuffles. Finally, the tensor algebra becomes a Hopf algebra with antipode given by extended linearly to all of ""TV"". This is just the standard Hopf algebra structure on a free algebra, where one defines the comultiplication on formula_18 by and then extends to formula_20 via Similarly one defines the antipode on formula_18 by and then extends the antipode as the unique antiautomorphism of formula_5 with this property, i.e. we define the antipode on formula_20 via "
wikipedia-363631," Ben E. King  Benjamin Earl King (born September 28, 1938), better known as Ben E. King, is an American soul singer. He is perhaps best known as the singer and co-composer of ""Stand by Me"", a US Top 10 hit in both 1961 and later in 1986 (when it was used as the theme to the film of the same name) and a number one hit in the UK in 1987, and as one of the principal lead singers of the R&B vocal group The Drifters. Early life. King was born Benjamin Earl Nelson on September 28, 1938 in Henderson, North Carolina, and moved to Harlem, New York, at age 9. Career. In 1958, King (still using his birth name) joined a doo wop group called The Five Crowns. Later in 1958, The Drifters' manager George Treadwell fired the members of the original Drifters, and replaced them with The Five Crowns. King had a string of R&B hits with the group on Atlantic Records. He co-wrote and sang lead on the first Atlantic hit by the new version of the Drifters, ""There Goes My Baby"" (1959). He also sang lead on a succession of hits by the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, including ""Save the Last Dance for Me"", ""This Magic Moment"", and ""I Count the Tears"". King only recorded thirteen songs with The Drifters— two backing other lead singers and eleven lead vocal performances —including a non-single called ""Temptation"" (later redone by Drifters vocalist Johnny Moore). Due to a contract dispute with Treadwell in which King and his manager, Lover Patterson, demanded that King be given a salary increase and a fair share of royalties, King never again performed with the Drifters on tour or on television; he would only record with the group until a suitable replacement could be found. On television, fellow Drifters member Charlie Thomas usually lip synched the songs that King had recorded with the Drifters. This end gave rise to a new beginning. In May 1960, King left the Drifters, assuming the more memorable stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a successful solo career. Remaining on Atlantic Records on its Atco imprint, King scored his first solo hit with the ballad ""Spanish Harlem"" (1961). His next single, ""Stand by Me"", written with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, ultimately would be voted as one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. ""Stand by Me"", ""There Goes My Baby"", and ""Spanish Harlem"" were named as three of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll; and each of those records plus ""Save The Last Dance For Me"" has earned a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. King's other well-known songs include ""Don't Play That Song (You Lied)"", ""Amor"", ""Seven Letters"", ""How Can I Forget"", ""On the Horizon"", ""Young Boy Blues"", ""First Taste of Love"", ""Here Comes the Night"", ""Ecstasy"", and ""That's When It Hurts"". In the summer of 1963, King had a Top 30 hit with ""I (Who Have Nothing)"", which reached the Top 10 on New York's radio station, WMCA. King's records continued to place well on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart until 1965. British pop bands began to dominate the pop music scene, but King still continued to make R&B hits, including ""What is Soul?"" (1966), ""Tears, Tears, Tears"" (1967), and ""Supernatural Thing"" (1975). A 1986 re-issue of ""Stand by Me"" followed the song's use as the theme song to the movie ""Stand By Me"" and re-entered the ""Billboard"" Top Ten after a 25-year absence. In 1990, King and Bo Diddley, along with Doug Lazy, recorded a revamped Hip Hop version of The Monotones' 1958 hit song ""Book of Love"" for the soundtrack of the movie ""Book of Love"". He also recorded a children's album, ""I Have Songs In My Pocket"", written and produced by children's music artist Bobby Susser in 1998, which won the ""Early Childhood News' Directors' Choice Award"" and ""Dr. Toy's/The Institute For Childhood Resources Award."" King performed ""Stand by Me"" on the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" in 2007. Ahmet Ertegun said, ""King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues."" As a Drifter and as a solo artist, King had achieved five number one hits: ""There Goes My Baby"", ""Save The Last Dance For Me"", ""Stand By Me"", ""Supernatural Thing"", and the 1986 re-issue of ""Stand By Me"". He also earned 12 Top 10 hits and 25 Top 40 hits from 1959 to 1986. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Drifter; he has also been nominated as a solo artist. King's ""I (Who Have Nothing)"" was selected for the ""The Sopranos"" ""Peppers and Eggs Soundtrack CD"" (2001). King was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009. On March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that ""Stand By Me"" would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of the song. Current activities. Currently, King is active in his charitable foundation, the Stand By Me Foundation, and is also a founding Champion of the Global Village Champions Foundation along with Muhammad Ali, Gary US Bonds, and Yank Barry. He has been a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey since the late 1960s. King performed ""Stand By Me"" during a televised tribute to late comedian George Carlin, as he was one of Carlin's favorite artists. On November 11, 2010, he performed ""Stand By Me"" on the Latin Grammys with Prince Royce. "
wikipedia-363638," Lüderitz  Lüderitz is a harbour town in south-west Namibia, lying on one of the least hospitable coasts in Africa. It is a port developed around Robert Harbour and Shark Island. The town is known for its colonial architecture, including some Art Nouveau work, and for wildlife including seals, penguins, flamingos and ostriches. It is also home to a museum, and lies at the end of a decommissioned railway line to Keetmanshoop. In 2013, it was reported that Lüderitz was renamed into ""ǃNamiǂNûs"". This pertains only to the constituency, though. History. The bay on which Lüderitz is situated was discovered by Bartolomeu Dias in 1487. He named the bay ""Angra Pequena"" () and erected a stone cross on the southern peninsula. In the 18th century Dutch adventurers and scientists explored the area in search of minerals but did not have much success. Further exploration expeditions followed in the early 19th century during which the vast wildlife in the ocean was discovered. Profitable enterprises were set up, including whaling, seal hunting, fishing, and guano-harvesting. Lüderitz thus began its life as a trading post. The town was founded in 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang purchased Angra Pequena and some of the surrounding land on behalf of Adolf Lüderitz, a ""Hanseat"" from Bremen in Germany, from the local Nama chief Joseph Fredericks II in Bethanie. When Adolf Lüderitz did not return from an expedition to the Orange River in 1886, Angra Pequeña was named ""Lüderitzbucht"" in his honour. In 1909, after the discovery of diamonds nearby, Lüderitz enjoyed a sudden surge of prosperity due to the development of a diamond rush to the area. In 1912 Lüderitz already had 1,100 inhabitants, not counting the indigenous population. Although situated in harsh environment between desert and Ocean, trade in the harbour town surged, and the adjacent diamond mining settlement of Kolmanskop was built. After the German World War I capitulation South Africa took over the administration of German South-West Africa in 1915. Many Germans were deported from Lüderitz, contributing to its shrinking in population numbers. From 1920 onwards, diamond mining was only conducted further south of town in places like Pomona and Elizabeth Bay. This development consequently led to the loss of Lüderitz' importance as trade place. Only small fishing enterprises, minimal dock activity, and a few carpet weavers remained. In an effort to remove colonial names from the maps of Namibia, the Namibian government in 2013 renamed the constituency into ǃNamiǂNûs, the native speakers name before in 1884 the Germans called the place ""Lüderitz"" was ""Chanugaub"". Geography. The harbour has a very shallow rock bottom, making it unusable for modern ships; this led to Walvis Bay becoming the centre of the Namibian shipping industry. Recently, however, the addition of a new quay has allowed larger fishing vessels to dock at Lüderitz. The town has also re-styled itself in an attempt to lure tourists to the area, which includes a new waterfront area for shops and offices. In the bay lies Shark island, site of the concentration camp that was used in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide between 1904 and 1907. Just outside of Lüderitz lies the ghost town of Kolmanskop, a prominent tourist destination. This previously bustling diamond town is now abandoned, and fights a constant struggle against being buried under the shifting sand dunes of the Namib desert. Conservation. The coastline in the area is recognised by Bird Life and other global conservation groups as one of the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) for important coastal seabird breeding. Mercury Island, Ichaboe Island, Halifax Island and the Possession Islands support the entire Namibian breeding population of Cape Gannets Morus Capensis, 96% of the Namibian population of the endangered African Penguin ""Spheniscus Demersus"", and nearly one quarter of the global breeding population of Crowned Cormorants Phalacrocorax coronatus. Approximately 80% of the global population of the endangered Bank Cormorant Phalacrocorax neglectus breeds on Mercury Island and in the Ichaboe Islands. In April 2009, an oil spill from an oil tanker risked hundreds of African Penguins and other flora and fauna. Climate. Lüderitz has a mild desert climate (""BWn"", according to the Köppen climate classification), with pleasant temperatures throughout the year. The average annual precipitation is .  Sport. Lüderitz is home to the Lüderitz Speed Challenge, the only international sporting event held in the town. This is an annual month-long speed sailing event held in the last quarter of the year under the auspices of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC). In 1984 Lüderitz was the starting point for explorer and sailor Amyr Klink's successful solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, rowing for 101 days all the way to the Brazilian coast with no other form of propulsion. Economy and Infrastructure. Construction of a new port at Shearwater Bay, 30 km south of Lüderitz, has been proposed for the export of coal from Botswana with a 1600 km railway connecting the two. Lüderitz is the terminus of the railway line to Seeheim where the railway connects to the rest of the country's network. This line was completed in 1908 but is currently not operational. Rebuilding of a remaining track gap to Aus has been delayed since 2009. Media. Lüderitz has a local monthly newspaper, ""Buchter News"". The paper, which was started as a source of free English-language reading material, is run by volunteers from the British gap year charity Project Trust. "
wikipedia-363639," Webbing  Webbing is a strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube of varying width and fibres often used in place of rope. The name webbing comes from the meshed material frequently used in its construction, which resembles a web. It is a versatile component used in climbing, slacklining, furniture manufacturing, automobile safety, auto racing, towing, parachuting, military apparel, load securing, and many other fields. Originally made of cotton or flax, most modern webbing is made of synthetic fibers such as nylon, polypropylene or polyester. Webbing is also made from exceptionally high-strength material, such as Dyneema, and Kevlar. Webbing is both light and strong, with breaking strengths readily available in excess of 10,000 lb (44.4 kN) There are two basic constructions of webbing. Flat webbing is a solid weave, with seatbelts and most backpack straps being common examples. Tubular webbing consists of a flattened tube, and is commonly used in climbing and industrial applications. Sporting goods. In rock climbing, nylon webbing is used in slings, runners, harnesses, anchor extensions and quickdraws. Webbing is used in many ways in hiking and camping gear including backpacks, straps, load adjusters and tent adjusters. There are two types of webbing: tubular and flat. The most popular webbing is one inch but it is available in two and three inch widths which in earlier days were often used in lieu of climbing harnesses. Wrapped around the waist several times, they were less bulky and more comfortable than the old school method of tying the rope around the waist. More elaborate configurations would include leg loops, which were essential to hold a climber who had fallen or otherwise found themselves dangling. If left supported only by rope or webbing wrapped around the waist, the diaphragm could be constricted and many climbers died as a result of asphyxiation. Narrower webbing is frequently looped through chockstones which are typically metal in shapes such as hexagonal, square, tubular, T, etc., and which are jammed into cracks as safety anchors. In other cases, webbing is looped over rock outcroppings. Unlike tubular rope, webbing is less likely to inch its way off the rock. Note that webbing construction is either utterly flat or flat-tubular; the latter tends to handle better but knots are more likely to jam. The most popular knots in webbing are the water knot and the grapevine knot. The latter is stronger, but uses more webbing for the knot. It is customary to leave a couple inches extending from the knot, and in many cases climbers tape the ends down onto the main loops. Webbing is also less expensive than rope of similar size particularly kernmantle rope which requires elaborate and expensive manufacturing. Unlike rope, which has manufacturers seeking brand identification and customer loyalty, webbing manufacture is typically generic. Climbing shops sell it off of a spool on a per yard or per foot basis. It is cut with a hot wire as is nylon rope, which prevents fraying and unravelling. However, when webbing does fray and unravel, the result is less disastrous than with rope, which is another albeit minimal advantage. Webbing suffers the drawback of less elasticity than perlon rope, and it may be more difficult to handle with gloves or mittens on. Slacklines often use flat or tubular 1-inch (2.5 cm) webbing, or flat 2-inch (5 cm) webbing. Other widths are used, but are less common. White water rafting boats use tubular webbing for bow lines, stern lines, ""chicken lines"" (around the exterior perimeter of the boat), equipment tie down, or floor lacing for self-bailing rafts. Rafters call tubular webbing ""hoopie"" or ""hoopi"". Rafters also use camstraps with flat webbing for equipment tie down. Automotive and racing safety. Seat belts are an obvious example of webbings used in auto safety but there are myriad other uses. Nylon and polyester webbing are used a great deal in auto racing safety for a large variety of items. Racing harnesses restraining the driver have used nylon webbing for years, but since the death of Dale Earnhardt Polyester webbing is becoming more popular due to its increased strength, and lower rate of elongation under load. The nylon commercial type 9 webbing generally used in racing harnesses stretches approximately 20 to 30 percent of its initial length at 2500 lb (11.1 Kn) while Polyester only stretches 5 to 15 percent. Window nets to prevent objects from entering the driver compartment are constructed of polypropylene webbing, as are helmet nets used to reduce side loads to the head in Sprint cars. The HANS device uses webbing tethers to attach the helmet to the collar, and the Hutchens device is made almost entirely of webbing. Furniture. Webbing is used in couches and chairs as a base for the seating areas that is both strong and flexible. Webbing used as a support is often rubberised to improve resilience and add elasticity. Many types of outdoor furniture use little more than thin light webbing for the seating areas. Webbing is also used to reinforce joints and areas that tend to flex. Military. Webbing is used to make military belts, packs and pouches, and by extension also refers to the items themselves. The British Army adopted cotton webbing to replace leather after the Second Boer War although leather belts are still worn in more formal dress. The term is still used for a soldier's combat equipment, although cotton webbing has since been replaced with more advanced materials. The webbing system used by the British Army today is known as Personal Load Carrying Equipment and is informally called ""webbing"". In the British Army, this webbing system is designed to be light enough to carry the vital things needed in battle and for outdoor survival. It is made so that if the backpack or bergen is lost or abandoned, the soldier can survive on emergency rations carried in the ""webbing"" for up to 24 hours, although this can be extended if supplies are rationed. Typical contents of webbing include cooking equipment, 24 hours worth of rations, ammunition, first aid or survival supplies and sheltering equipment. Most webbing systems incorporate a degree of modular construction consisting of a yoke (a type of shoulder harness), a belt and a variety of pouches specific to different tasks, for example pouches designed to carry ammunition magazines may have dividers or special waterproofing. Different combinations of pouches can be used to customise webbing to better suit the mission it is needed for. Generally it is unusual for western armies to fight with a cumbersome, complete backpack or bergen and so prior to an anticipated battle the main backpack is usually stowed away from the forward edge of the battle area and ""webbing"" (a day pack,) is used as the immediate load bearing equipment instead. Webbing belts are also used frequently by modern cadet and scout groups, as well as police and security forces. Transportation. Tie downs, tie straps, cargo straps, E-track straps, cargo hoist straps, tow ropes, winch straps, cargo nets, and dozens of other items are used by thousands of shipping and trucking companies every day. The transportation industry is perhaps the largest user of high strength webbing in the world. Apparel. Belts, suspenders, sandals and purses are woven from various forms of webbing. Corset style back braces and other medical braces often incorporate straps made from webbing. Pet Collars and Leashes. Dog collars, Leashes, and Dog Harnesses frequently utilize webbing to make collars and leashes. While Nylon and Polyester are most common, Polypropylene can also be used. These pet products are often sewn together with decorative ribbon or cotton fabric. Hardware. Webbing is often outfitted with various forms of tie down hardware to extend its range of abilities (and create tie down straps). This hardware can take the form of: There is also hardware associated with the various end fittings to attach them to a surface, such as footman’s loops, brackets and E-track fittings. "
wikipedia-363648," Lacuna Coil  Lacuna Coil is an Italian metal band from Milan. Since their formation in 1994, the group have had two name changes, being previously known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal. Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs. The band's 2012 release, ""Dark Adrenaline"", peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. As of March 2012, Lacuna Coil has sold over 2 million records. History. Formation and debut EP (1994–98). Vocalist Andrea Ferro and bassist/composer Marco Coti Zelati formed Sleep of Right in Milan, Italy, 1994, and recruited Raffaele Zagaria on guitars, and Michaelangelo Algardi on the drums. After releasing two demos, ""Bleeding Souls"" and ""Noise of Bolgia"", Claudio Leo became the band's second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked Cristina Scabbia, a friend, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to ""Ethereal"", and signed to Century Media at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil, which in English means ""empty spiral"". Lacuna Coil released a self-titled EP through Century Media in 1998. Shortly after, there came the departure of bandmates Raffael Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with Moonspell after the release of the ""Lacuna Coil EP"". ""In a Reverie"" (1998–2000). Following a second European tour, the band recorded their debut full-length album, ""In a Reverie"", and added second guitarist Marco Biazzi. The band supported the album with another European tour, co-headlining with Skyclad. Allmusic rated the album 4 stars, saying it was ""a fine debut by a band that bears watching."" The band toured much more, participating in Milan's ""Rolling Stone"" magazine-sponsored venue, plus as a show headlined by a German band. ""Halflife"" EP and ""Unleashed Memories"" (2000–02). Following the debut, ""In a Reverie"", ""Half-Life"" was released in 2000 with five songs, entitled ""Half Life"", ""Hyperfast"", ""Stars"" (a cover of a Dubstar single), ""Trance Awake"", and a demo version of a future song, ""Senzafine."" ""Senzafine"" was added onto the band's next big project: their 2001 album ""Unleashed Memories."" The studio album only had ten songs on it, but a future release included the five songs from the ""Halflife"" EP. ""Comalies"" (2002–06). The band was in for a change for the better when its breakthrough album, ""Comalies"" was released in 2002; it received high reviews from certain corners of the metal world. A significant player on Europe's metal scene for nearly a decade at this point, the band was virtually unknown in the United States until it began touring there. ""Uranium"" gave the band some of its earliest US exposure; over a year later, the first single from ""Comalies"", ""Heaven's a Lie"", began to receive radio and media attention, pulling the band into North America's musical mainstream. They kicked off their first US tour in 2003, supported by Dog Fashion Disco. Networks such as Fuse played the song's video, for example. In early 2005, ""Heaven's a Lie"" won in The 4th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Hard Rock/Metal Song. The beginning of this song was also used as the introduction music for the audio podcast novel, ""The Rookie"", by Scott Sigler. The second single, ""Swamped"", was played in heavy rotation and used in the video game '. It also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie '. Music videos were filmed for both songs and broadcast on MTV2's ""Headbanger's Ball"", which also had the band perform a live, acoustic rendition of ""Heaven's a Lie"". By 2004, ""Comalies"" had become the best-selling CD in Century Media's history. The band appeared at Ozzfest in between headlining club tours in the United States and Europe. A bonus, extended version of ""Comalies"" was released both in stores and on iTunes. This version consisted of both live and acoustic versions of the songs ""Heaven's a Lie"", ""Swamped"", ""Unspoken"", ""Aeon"", and ""Senzafine"" from ""Unleashed Memories."" ""Karmacode"" (2006–08). The band and label postponed the release of their follow-up to ""Comalies"", ""Karmacode"", to early 2006. According to the band's website, this made it possible for more time to be spent on production, and to avoid the crowded summer 2005 release schedule for metal albums. On December 23, 2005 the band announced on their web site that all recording, mixing, and mastering on ""Karmacode"" had been completed. It was then announced that ""Karmacode"" would be released in the United States on April 4, 2006. During their 2005 European Tour, Lacuna Coil debuted two new songs from Karmacode at selected concerts: ""Our Truth"" and ""Fragile"" under the working titles ""Antonio"" and ""A2"" respectively. ""Karmacode"" debuted at number 28 on the ""Billboard"" 200. Considered by ""Billboard"" to be ""the biggest album in the history of Century Media Records"", it was acclaimed by music critics and magazines. Corresponding with the release of the new album, Lacuna Coil toured with Rob Zombie throughout North America in early 2006. After their tour with Zombie, they performed main stage at Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, and Hatebreed becoming the first female-fronted band to co-headline the heavy metal festival. That summer they also played on the main stage of the Download Festival (a three-day music festival in England's Donington Park), which was headlined by Metallica, Tool, and Guns N' Roses. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and Seemless for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour. Four singles were officially released from ""Karmacode"": ""Our Truth"", ""Closer"", ""Within Me"", and a cover of Depeche Mode's ""Enjoy the Silence."" ""Our Truth"" was the first single released, and had a music video produced for it. The song was featured on the """" soundtrack and entered the top forty on the ""Billboard"" Mainstream Rock chart in the United States. The band toured extensively to support the album throughout 2007. This included the Jägermeister Music Tour, The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007 Loudpark Festival '07 in Saitama City's Saitama Super Arena, and the Australian leg of Megadeth's Gigantour. Lacuna Coil's first live DVD was released in November 2008, entitled Visual Karma (Body, Mind and Soul). The CD/DVD package is a retrospective of all things from the band's ""Karmacode"" album cycle. The set list features concerts filmed at Germany's Wacken Festival and at the Japanese Loudpark Festival in 2007. ""Shallow Life"" (2008–10). In 2008, it was announced that Lacuna Coil's fifth studio album would be produced by Don Gilmore, and would have some Arabic influences. Cristina Scabbia announced to the magazine Rock Sound, ""It's different, but it's our style. We haven't done anything absolutely different from our style, because that wouldn't be natural, that would be weird - it wouldn't be us. The songs are definitely more powerful, more complete, more intense, more straight-to-the-point"". Andrea Ferro said, ""We've put more attention on the real meaning of the songs, so the vocals are a bit more prominent. We've worked a lot with Don Gilmore on the pronunciation of the words in English, so people really understand the meanings of the words. There are strong choruses, where people can relate and really understand what we mean"". On December 13, 2008, it was revealed that the new album would be titled ""Shallow Life"". The album was released in Europe on April 20, 2009 and in the United States on April 21, 2009. It debuted at number 16 on the ""Billboard"" Top 200 Album Chart, and became Lacuna Coil's first Top 20 album in the U.S. It has sold nearly 70,000 copies in the United States. In February and March 2009, Lacuna Coil played at the Australian music festival Soundwave alongside metal acts including DevilDriver, In Flames, Lamb of God, and Nine Inch Nails. The festival spanned five capital cities, at which they performed their single ""Spellbound"", from ""Shallow Life"" for the first time. Early June saw them play in the UK at Download Festival. Their set was scheduled for the opening day, where they would play on the second stage just before Opeth and later Mötley Crüe. Later in July 2009, Lacuna Coil embarked on the American Spellbound Tour, alongside Kill Hannah, Seventh Void, and Dommin. This was Lacuna Coil's first U.S. headlining run in over two years, and the first tour the band has been on since the Music as a Weapon Tour IV alongside Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, and Chimaira in early 2009. During Early 2010 (Jan/Feb) the band came to the United Kingdom to do a Headline ""Shallow Life"" tour with their support acts Dommin and Dirty Little Rabbits.

wikipedia-363651," Dark wave  Dark wave or darkwave is a music genre that began in the late 1970s, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave added dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed alongside dark wave music, whose members were called ""wavers"" or ""dark wavers"". History. 1980s. The term was coined in Europe in the 1980s to describe a dark and melancholy variant of new wave and post-punk music, such as gothic rock and dark synthpop, and was first applied to musicians such as Bauhaus, Joy Division, The Sisters Of Mercy, Cocteau Twins, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Chameleons. The movement spread internationally, spawning such developments as French coldwave. Coldwave described groups such as KaS Product, Martin Dupont, Asylum Party, Norma Loy, Pavillon 7B, Résistance, Clair Obscur, Opera Multi Steel, The Breath of Life, and Trisomie 21. Subsequently, different dark wave genres merged and influenced each other, e.g. electronic new wave music (also called ""electro wave"" in Germany) with gothic rock, or used elements of ambient and post-industrial music. Attrition, In The Nursery and Pink Industry (UK), Clan of Xymox (Netherlands), Mittageisen (Switzerland), Die Form (France), and Psyche (Canada) played this music in the 1980s. German dark wave groups of the 1980s were associated with the Neue Deutsche Welle, and included Asmodi Bizarr, II. Invasion, Unlimited Systems, Mask For, Moloko †, Maerchenbraut and Xmal Deutschland. 1990s. After the new wave and post-punk movements faded in the mid-1980s, dark wave was renewed as an underground movement by German bands such as Deine Lakaien, and Diary of Dreams, as well as Project Pitchfork along with its offshoot Aurora Sutra, and Wolfsheim. The Italians The Frozen Autumn, Ataraxia, and Nadezhda, the South African band The Awakening and the French Corpus Delicti, also practiced the style. All of these bands followed a path based on the new wave and post-punk movements of the 1980s. At the same time, a number of German artists, including Das Ich, Relatives Menschsein and Lacrimosa, developed a more theatrical style, interspersed with German poetic and metaphorical lyrics, called ""Neue Deutsche Todeskunst"" (""New German Death Art""). Other bands, such as Silke Bischoff, In My Rosary and Engelsstaub mingled dark synthpop or goth rock with elements of the neofolk or neoclassical genres. After 1993, in the United States, the term dark wave (as the one-word variant ""darkwave"") became associated with the Projekt Records label, because it was the name of their printed catalog, and was used to market German artists like Project Pitchfork in the U.S. Projekt features bands such as Lycia, Black Tape for a Blue Girl and Love Spirals Downwards, most of these characterized by ethereal female vocals. This style took cues from 1980s bands, like Cocteau Twins. This music is often referred to as ethereal dark wave. The label has also had a long association with Attrition, who appeared on the label's earliest compilations. Another American label in this vein was Tess Records, which featured This Ascension and Faith and the Muse. Clan of Xymox, who had returned to their 1980s sound, following almost a decade as the more synthpop Xymox, also signed to Tess in 1997. Joshua Gunn, a professor of communication studies at Louisiana University, described American dark wave as Wave-atypical influences. A number of other U.S. bands mixed elements of dark wave and ethereal wave with later developments in electronic music. Love Spirals Downwards, Collide, Deleyaman and Switchblade Symphony incorporated elements of trip hop, while The Crüxshadows combined a range of contemporary electronic dance music elements with their synth-based alternative rock style.

wikipedia-363665," Stockholm City Hall  Stockholm City Hall ( or ""Stadshuset"" locally) is the building of the Municipal Council for the City of Stockholm in Sweden. It stands on the eastern tip of Kungsholmen island, next to Riddarfjärden's northern shore and facing the islands of Riddarholmen and Södermalm. It houses offices and conference rooms as well as ceremonial halls, and the luxury restaurant ""Stadshuskällaren"". It is the venue of the Nobel Prize banquet and one of Stockholm's major tourist attractions.  Site and construction. In 1907 the city council decided to build a new city hall at the former site of Eldkvarn. An architectural contest was held which in a first stage resulted in the selection of drafts by Ragnar Östberg, Carl Westman, Ivar Tengbom jointly with Ernst Torulf, and Carl Bergsten. After a further competition between Westman and Östberg the latter was assigned to the construction of the City Hall, while the former was asked to construct Stockholm Court House. Östberg modified his original draft using elements of Westman's project, including the tower. During the construction period, Östberg constantly reworked his plans, resulting e.g. in the addition of the lantern on top of the tower, and the abandonment of the blue glazed tiles for the Blue Hall. Oskar Asker was employed as construction leader and Paul Toll, of construction company Kreuger & Toll, designed the foundations. The construction took twelve years, from 1911 to 1923. Nearly eight million red bricks were used. The dark red bricks, called ""munktegel"" (monks's brick) because of their traditional use in the construction of monasteries and churches, were provided by Lina brick factory near Södertälje. Construction was carried out by craftsmen using traditional techniques. The building was inaugurated on 23 June 1923, exactly 400 years after Gustav Vasa's arrival in Stockholm. Verner von Heidenstam and Hjalmar Branting held the inaugurational speeches. Architecture and style. The site, adjacent to Stadshusbron, being bordered by the streets of Hantverkargatan and Norr Mälarstrand to the north and west, and the shore of Riddarfjärden to the south and east, allowed for a spacious layout. The building follows a roughly rectangular ground plan. It is built around two open spaces, a piazza called ""Borgargården"" on the eastern side, and the Blue Hall (""Blå hallen"") to the west. The Blue Hall, with its straight walls and arcades, incorporates elements of a representative courtyard. Its walls are in fact without blue decorations, but it has kept its name after Östberg's original design. It is known as the dining hall used for the banquet held after the annual Nobel Prize award ceremony. The organ in the Blue Hall is with its 10,270 pipes the largest in Scandinavia. Above the Blue Hall lies the Golden Hall (""Gyllene Salen""), named after the decorative mosaics made of more than 18 million tiles. The mosaics make use of motifs from Swedish history. They were executed by the Berlin, Germany, firm of Puhl & Wagner Gottfried Heinersdorff, after nine years of negotiations by Gottfried Heinersdorff (1883-1941) for the commission.  The southeast corner of the building, immediately adjacent to the shore, is marked by a monumental tower crowned by the Three Crowns, an old national symbol for Sweden. The tower is 106 metres high and is accessible by an elevator or by a stair of 365 steps. The eastern side of its base is decorated with a gold-plated cenotaph of Birger Jarl. Stadshuset is considered one of Sweden's foremost examples of national romanticism in architecture. The unique site, overlooking Riddarfjärden, inspired a central motif of the construction, namely the juxtaposition of city architecture and water that also represents a central feature of Stockholm's cityscape as a whole. The architectural style is one of refined eclecticism, blending massive, austere, North European brick construction and playful elements reminiscent of oriental and venetian architecture, such as turrets adorned with golden starlets, decorated balconies, wooden masts, and statues. Stadshusparken. The small park between the building and Lake Mälaren's shore is adorned with several sculptures, among them Carl Eldh's ensemble representing the three artists August Strindberg, Gustaf Fröding and Ernst Josephson, as well as Eldh's bronze sculptures ""Sången"" and ""Dansen"" (""The Song"" and ""The Dance""). To the south-east of the City Hall, facing Riddarholmen, is a pillar roughly 20 meters tall with a statue of Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson on top. "
wikipedia-363670," Angelina Weld Grimké  Angelina Weld Grimké (February 27, 1880 – June 10, 1958) was an African-American journalist, teacher, playwright and poet who was part of the Harlem Renaissance; she was one of the first African-American women to have a play publicly performed. Life and career. Angelina Weld Grimké was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1880 to a biracial family. Her father, Archibald Grimké, was a lawyer, the second African American to have graduated from Harvard Law School. Her mother, Sarah Stanley, was European American from a Midwestern middle-class family. Information about her is scarce. Grimké's parents met in Boston, where he had established a law practice. Angelina was named for her father's aunt Angelina Grimké Weld, who with her sister Sarah Grimké had brought him and his brothers into her family after learning about him. (He was a natural son of her brother, who had died.) When Grimké and Sarah Stanley married, they faced strong opposition from her family, due to concerns over race. The marriage did not last very long. Not long after Angelina's birth, Sarah left Archibald and returned with the infant to the Midwest. After Sarah began a career of her own, she sent Angelina, then seven, back to Massachusetts to live with her father. Angelina Grimké would have little to no contact with her mother after that. Sarah Stanley committed suicide several years later. Angelina's paternal grandfather was Henry Grimké, of a large and wealthy slaveholding family based in Charleston, South Carolina. Her paternal grandmother was Nancy Weston, an enslaved woman of mixed race, with whom Henry became involved as a widower. They lived together and had three sons: Archibald, Francis and John (born after his father's death in 1852). Henry taught Nancy and the boys to read and write. Among Henry's family were two sisters who had opposed slavery and left the South before he began his relationship with Weston; Sarah and Angelina Grimké became notable abolitionists in the North. The Grimkés were also related to John Grimké Drayton of Magnolia Plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. Angelina's uncle, Francis J. Grimké, graduated from Lincoln University, PA and Princeton Theological Seminary. He became a Presbyterian minister in Washington, DC. He married Charlotte Forten, who became known as an abolitionist and diarist. She was from a prominent black abolitionist family from Philadelphia. From the ages of 14 to 18, Angelina lived with her aunt and uncle in Washington, DC and attended school there, as her father was serving as appointed consul (1894 and 1898) to the Dominican Republic. Indicating the significance of Archibald's consulship in her life, Angelina later recalled, ""it was thought best not to take me down to Domingo but so often and so vivid have I had the scene and life described that I seem to have been there too.""  Angelina Grimké next attended the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics – which later became the Department of Hygiene of Wellesley College. After graduating, she and her father moved to Washington, D.C. to be with his brother and family. In 1902, she began teaching English at the Armstrong Manual Training School. In 1916 she moved to a teaching position at the Dunbar High School, renowned for its academic excellence, where one of her pupils was the future poet and playwright May Miller. During the summers, Grimké frequently took classes at Harvard University, where her father had attended law school. Around 1913, Grimké was involved in a train crash which left her health in a precarious state. Nevertheless, when her father took ill in 1928, she tended to him until his death in 1930. Afterwards, she left Washington, DC, for New York City, where she settled in Brooklyn and lived a quiet retirement as a semi-recluse. She died in 1958. Literary career. Grimké wrote essays, short stories and poems which were published in ""The Crisis"", the newspaper of the NAACP, edited by W.E.B. Du Bois; and ""Opportunity."" They were also collected in anthologies of the Harlem Renaissance: ""The New Negro"", ""Caroling Dusk"", and ""Negro Poets and Their Poems"". Her more well-known poems include ""The Eyes of My Regret"", ""At April"", ""Trees"" and ""The Closing Door"". While living in Washington, DC, she was included among the figures of the Harlem Renaissance, as her work was published in its journals and she became connected to figures in its circle. Some critics place her in the period before the Renaissance. During that time, she counted the poet Georgia Douglas Johnson as one of her friends. Grimké wrote ""Rachel"" – originally titled ""Blessed Are the Barren"" – one of the first plays to protest lynching and racial violence. The three-act drama was written for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which called for new works to rally public opinion against D. W. Griffith's recently released film, ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915), which glorified the Ku Klux Klan and portrayed a racist view of blacks and of their role in the American Civil War and Reconstruction in the South. Produced in 1916 in Washington, D.C., and subsequently in New York City, ""Rachel"" was performed by an all-black cast. Reaction to the play was good. The NAACP said of the play: ""This is the first attempt to use the stage for race propaganda in order to enlighten the American people relating to the lamentable condition of ten millions of Colored citizens in this free republic."" ""Rachel"" portrays the life of an African-American family in the North in the early 20th century. Centered on the family of the title character, each role expresses different responses to the racial discrimination against blacks at the time. The themes of motherhood and the innocence of children are integral aspects of Grimké's work. Rachel develops as she changes her perceptions of what the role of a mother might be, based on her sense of the importance of a naivete towards the terrible truths of the world around her. A lynching is the spectrum of the play; it authenticates the African-American experience. The play was published in 1920, but received little attention after its initial productions. In the years since, however, its significance has been recognized as a precursor to the Harlem Renaissance, and one of the first examples of a political and cultural trend to explore the African roots of African Americans. Sexuality. At the age of 16, Grimké wrote to a friend, Mamie Burrile: I know you are too young now to become my wife, but I hope, darling, that in a few years you will come to me and be my love, my wife! How my brain whirls how my pulse leaps with joy and madness when I think of these two words, 'my wife'"" Two years earlier, in 1903, Grimké and her father had a falling out when she told him that she was in love. Archibald Grimké responded with an ultimatum demanding that she choose between her lover and himself. Grimké family biographer Mark Perry speculates that the person involved may have been female, and that Archibald may already have been aware of Angelina's sexual proclivity. Analysis by modern literary critics has provided strong evidence that Grimke was lesbian or bisexual. Some critics believe this is expressed in her published poetry in a subtle way, but more evidence came after her death by scholars' study of her diaries and more explicit unpublished works. The ""Dictionary of Literary Biography: African-American Writers Before the Harlem Renaissance"" states: ""In several poems and in her diaries Grimké expressed the frustration that her lesbianism created; thwarted longing is a theme in several poems."" Some of her unpublished poems are more explicitly lesbian, implying that she lived a life of suppression, ""both personal and creative.” References. Notes Bibliography Further reading "
wikipedia-363674," Cecil Beaton  Sir Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton, CBE (14 January 1904 – 18 January 1980) was an English fashion, portrait and war photographer, diarist, painter, interior designer and an Academy Award-winning stage and costume designer for films and the theatre. He was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1970. Biography. Beaton was born on 14 January 1904 in Hampstead the son of Ernest Walter Hardy Beaton (1867–1936), a prosperous timber merchant, and his wife Etty Sissons (1872–1962). His grandfather, Walter Hardy Beaton (1841–1904), had founded the family business of Beaton Brothers Timber Merchants and Agents, and his father followed into the business. Ernest Beaton was also an amateur actor and had met his wife, Cecil's mother Esther or Etty, when playing the lead in a play. She was the daughter of a Cumbrian blacksmith named Joseph Sissons and had come to London to visit her married sister. Through his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Oldcorn, Cecil was related to the Blessed Father Edward Oldcorne who was involved in the Gunpowder Plot. Ernest and Etty Beaton had four children – in addition to Cecil there were two daughters Nancy (1909–99, who married Sir Hugh Smiley) and Barbara (1912–73, known as Baba, she married Alec Hambro), and another son Reginald (1905–33). Cecil Beaton was educated at Heath Mount School (where he was bullied by Evelyn Waugh) and St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, where his artistic talent was quickly recognised. Both Cyril Connolly and Henry Longhurst report in their autobiographies being overwhelmed by the beauty of Beaton's singing at the St Cyprian's school concerts. When Beaton was growing up his Nanny had a Kodak 3A Camera, a popular model which was renowned for being an ideal piece of equipment to learn on. Beaton's nanny began teaching him the basics of photography and developing film. He would often get his sisters and mother to sit for him. When he was sufficiently proficient, he would send the photos off to London society magazines, often writing under a pen name and ‘recommending’ the work of Beaton. Beaton attended Harrow, and then, despite having little or no interest in academia, moved on to St John's College, Cambridge, and studied history, art and architecture. Beaton continued his photography, and through his university contacts managed to get a portrait depicting the Duchess of Malfi published in ""Vogue"". It was actually George ""Dadie"" Rylands – ""a slightly out-of-focus snapshot of him as Webster's Duchess of Malfi standing in the sub-aqueous light outside the men's lavatory of the ADC Theatre at Cambridge."" Beaton left Cambridge without a degree in 1925. After proving hopeless as an office employee in his father's timber business, he spent 'many lugubrious months' learning to be an office worker with a cement merchant in Holborn. This resulted only in 'an orgy of photography at weekends' so he decided to strike out on his own. Under the patrongage of Osbert Sitwell he put on his first exhibition in the Cooling Gallery, London. It caused quite a stir. Believing that he would meet with greater success on the other side of the Atlantic, he left for New York and slowly built up a reputation there. By the time he left, he had 'a contract with Condé Nast Publications to take photographs exclusively for them for several thousand pounds a year for several years to come.' For fifteen years between 1930 and 1945, Beaton leased Ashcombe House in Wiltshire, where he entertained many notable figures. In 1948 he bought Reddish House, set in 2.5 acres of gardens, approximately 5 miles to the east in Broad Chalke. Here he transformed the interior, adding rooms on the eastern side, extending the parlour southwards, and introducing many new fittings. Greta Garbo was a visitor. The upper floor had been equipped for illegal cock-fighting at the beginning of the 20th century but Beaton used the cages as wardrobes to store the costumes from his set design of ""My Fair Lady"". He remained at the house until his death in 1980 and is buried in the churchyard. In 1947, he also bought a townhouse at number 8 Pelham Place in London. Career. Photography. Beaton designed book jackets and costumes for charity matinees, learning the professional craft of photography at the studio of Paul Tanqueray, until Vogue took him on regularly in 1927. He also set up his own studio, and one of his earliest clients and, later, best friends was Stephen Tennant; Beaton's photographs of Tennant and his circle are considered some of the best representations of the Bright Young People of the twenties and thirties. Beaton's first camera was a Kodak 3A folding camera. Over the course of his career, he employed both large format cameras, and smaller Rolleiflex cameras. Beaton was never known as a highly skilled technical photographer, and instead focused on staging a compelling model or scene and looking for the perfect shutter-release moment. He was a photographer for the British edition of ""Vogue"" in 1931 when George Hoyningen-Huene, photographer for the French ""Vogue"" travelled to England with his new friend Horst. Horst himself would begin to work for French ""Vogue"" in November of that year. The exchange and cross pollination of ideas between this collegial circle of artists across the Channel and the Atlantic gave rise to the look of style and sophistication for which the 1930s are known. Beaton is best known for his fashion photographs and society portraits. He worked as a staff photographer for ""Vanity Fair"" and ""Vogue"" in addition to photographing celebrities in Hollywood. However in 1938, he inserted 'some tiny-but-still-legible anti-Semitic phrases (including the word 'kike') into American Vogue at the side of an illustration about New York society. The issue was recalled and reprinted at vast expense, and Beaton was fired.' Humiliated, Beaton returned to England where the Queen recommended him to the Ministry of Information. He became one of Britain's leading war photographers, best known for his images of the damage done by the German blitz. His style sharpened and his range broadened, Beaton's career was restored by the war. Beaton often photographed the Royal Family for official publication. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother was his favourite Royal sitter, and he once pocketed her scented hankie as a keepsake from a highly successful shoot. Beaton took the famous wedding pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (wearing an haute couture ensemble by the noted American fashion designer Mainbocher). During the Second World War, Beaton was initially posted to the Ministry of Information and given the task of recording images from the home front. During this assignment he captured one of the most enduring images of British suffering during the war, that of three-year-old Blitz victim Eileen Dunne recovering in hospital, clutching her beloved teddy bear. When the image was published, America had not yet officially joined the war—but splashed across the press in the US, images such as Beaton’s helped push the American public to put pressure on their Government to help Britain in its hour of need. Beaton had a major influence on and relationship with two other leading lights in British photography, that of Angus McBean and David Bailey. McBean was arguably the best portrait photographer of his era—in the second part of McBean's career (post-war) his work is clearly heavily influenced by Beaton, though arguably McBean was technically far more proficient in his execution. Bailey was also enormously influenced by Beaton when they met while working for British Vogue in the early 1960s, Bailey's stark use of square format (6x6) images bears clear connections to Beaton's own working patterns. Stage and film design. After the war, Beaton tackled the Broadway stage, designing sets, costumes, and lighting for a 1946 revival of ""Lady Windermere's Fan"", in which he also acted. His most lauded achievement for the stage was the costumes for Lerner and Loewe's ""My Fair Lady"" (1956), which led to two Lerner and Loewe film musicals, ""Gigi"" (1958) and ""My Fair Lady"" (1964), both of which earned Beaton the Academy Award for Costume Design. He also designed the period costumes for the 1970 film ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever"". Additional Broadway credits include ""The Grass Harp"" (1952), ""The Chalk Garden"" (1955), ""Saratoga"" (1959), ""Tenderloin"" (1960), and ""Coco"" (1969). He is the winner of four Tony Awards. He also designed the sets and costumes for a production of Puccini’s last opera"" Turandot"", first used at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and then at Covent Garden. He also designed the academic dress of the University of East Anglia. Diaries. Cecil Beaton was also a published and well-known diarist. In his lifetime six volumes of diaries were published, spanning the years 1922–1974. Recently a number of unexpurgated diaries have been published. These differ immensely in places to Beaton's original publications. Fearing libel suits in his own lifetime, it would have been foolhardy for Beaton to have included some of his more frank and incisive observations. Personal life. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the New Year Honours 1972. Two years later he suffered a stroke that would leave him permanently paralysed on the right side of his body. Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, and had cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with Philippe Garner, expert-in-charge of photographs at Sotheby's. On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton's archive—excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by Vogue in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost singlehandedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive's preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton's only tangible assets, and what he considered his life's work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980. By the end of the 1970s, Beaton's health had faded. In January 1980, he died at Reddish House, his home in Broad Chalke in Wiltshire, at the age of 76. The great love of his life was the art collector Peter Watson, although they were never lovers. He had relationships with various men. He also had relationships with women, including the actresses Greta Garbo and Coral Browne, the dancer Adele Astaire, and the British socialite Doris Castlerosse. Work. Exhibitions. Major exhibitions have been held at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1968 and in 2004. The first international exhibition in thirty years, and first exhibition of his works to be held in Australia was held in Bendigo, Victoria from 10 December 2005 to 26 March 2006. In October 2011, the BBC's Antiques Roadshow featured an oil portrait by Beaton of rock star Mick Jagger, whom Beaton meet in the 1960s. The painting, originally sold at the Le Fevre Gallery in 1966, was valued for insurance purposes at £30,000. An exhibition celebrating The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and showing portraits of Her Majesty by Cecil Beaton, opens in October 2011 at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle. Cecil Beaton: Theatre of War at the Imperial War Museum, London: major retrospective of Beaton's war photography, held from 6 September 2012 – 1 January 2013 "
wikipedia-363675," Mariachi  Mariachi is a form of folk music from Mexico. Mariachi began as a regional folk style called “Son Jaliscience” in the center west of Mexico originally played only with string instruments and musicians dressed in the white pants and shirts of peasant farmers. From the 19th to 20th century, migrations from rural areas into cities such as Guadalajara and Mexico City, along with the Mexican government's cultural promotion gradually re-labeled it as ""Son"" style, with its alternate name of “mariachi” becoming used for the “urban” form. Modifications of the music include influences from other music such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. Name. The word mariachi was thought to have derived from the French word “mariage"" (marriage) dating from the French Intervention in Mexico in the 1860s, related to the music’s appearance at weddings. This was a common explanation on record jackets and travel brochures. However, this theory was disproven with the appearance of documents that showed that the word existed before this invasion. The origin of the word is still in dispute but most of the prominent theories state that it has indigenous roots. One states that it comes from the name of the wood from which the dance platform is made. Another states that “mariachi” comes from the indigenous name of a tree called pilla or cirimo and yet another states that it came from an image locally called “María H” (pronounced mah-ree-ah AH-chay). The term “mariachi” can refer to the music, the band or just one musician.  Origins. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous music was played with rattles, drums, flutes and conch-shell horns as part of religious celebrations. The Spanish introduced violins, guitars, harps, brass instruments, and woodwinds which mostly replaced the indigenous instruments. The European instruments were introduced to be used during Mass but were quickly adapted to secular events. Indigenous and mestizo peoples learned to play and make these instruments often giving them modified shapes and tunings. In addition to instruments, the Spanish introduced the concept of musical bands, which, in the colonial period, generally consisted of two violins, a harp and various guitars. This grouping gave rise to a number of folk musical styles in Mexico.  One of these folk musical styles was the son. This music featured string instruments. ""Son"" music divided into various regional varieties—the variety popular in the Jalisco area was called ""son jaliscense"", whose best known is “La Negra”. Modern mariachi music developed from this ""son"" style, with “mariachi” as an alternative name for ""son jaliscense"". Early mariachi players did not look like those of today; they played only string instruments such as guitars and harps and dressed in typical peasant clothing: white pants and shirts with huarache sandals. Those who could play the son jaliscense/mariachi music could find work at haciendas at a higher rate than those who could not. The distinction of mariachi from the older son jaliscense occurred slowly sometime during the 19th century. The music originated in the center-west of Mexico. Most claims for its origin lie in the state of Jalisco but neighboring states of Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacán have also claimed it. However, by the late 19th century, the music was firmly centered in Jalisco. Most legends put the origin of the modern mariachi in the town of Cocula, Jalisco. The distinction from son to modern mariachi comes from the modification of the music. By the end of the nineteenth century, the European art music tradition was firmly transplanted to Mexico, with opera, salon music, waltzes, and more written and performed both by Europeans and Mexicans in the country. One variety was the salon orchestras called ""orquestas típicas"" that performed in more rural settings, notably in charro outfits. This use of the charro outfit would be repeated again with the urban mariachi in the 1920s. After the Mexican Revolution, many haciendas had to let workers go, including mariachis. Groups would wander and play for a fee, which then obliged them to incorporate other music into their repertoires including waltzes and polkas. It also forced them to play in public venues. From the late 19th century to the 1930s, mariachi bands were semi professional. In the early 20th century, U.S. record companies were actively recording rural music in various parts of the world. One of these as a recording called Cuarteto Coculense by Columbia, Edison and Victor in 1908 and 1909, recognized as the “first” mariachi recordings. The music also gained attention in Mexico City when a wealthy hacienda family brought an early mariachi band from Cocula to play for President Porfirio Díaz in 1905.  Modern development. The common perception of the music and look of mariachi developed in the 20th century, as the music was transformed from a regional rural folk music to an urban phenomenon that came to represent Mexico. The music was first introduced to Mexico City in 1905. During this time, many farm workers moved to the city, including those from Jalisco, which settled around Plaza Garibaldi. These mariachi musicians developed new practices, such as performances in plazas and restaurants. However, it also continued its more traditional venues such as serenades, and performances at major family events. During this time, the Mexican government was heavily involved in cultural promotion as a way to create a unified Mexican identity after the end of the Mexican Revolution. One of these efforts was the promotion of mariachi as an international symbol of Mexican identity, first with radio and sound recordings and later with films. Mexico built a nationwide radio broadcasting network in the 1920s such as XEB and XEW, which began broadcasting mariachi music as a media production, rather than as a music for social events.This music was already being modified in part due to the advent of sound recording. For example, most son jaliscense songs were longer than the standard three-and-a-half minutes of the then-standard 78 rpm record, forcing the shortening of tunes. Around the same time, the popularity of jazz and Cuban music introduced the trumpet into mariachi, pushing the violins into second place and in some cases, replacing the harp. The most prized of the mariachis remained those from the state of Jalisco, particularly the areas of Cocula and Tecalitlán. They represented Mexico to the people during the Independence Day celebrations in Mexico City in 1933 as well as during Lázaro Cárdenas' election campaign in 1936.  The charro tradition was strong in Jalisco, especially in a region called Los Altos. After the Revolution, the charreada became a national sport in Mexico and rings were constructed specifically for them, followed by professional charro associations. With the breakup of the large haciendas, charros were no longer economically necessary but were used as a cultural ideal, especially by the film industry in the mid-20th century. The first charro movies date from the 1920s, but the first to sing mariachi was Tito Guízar in ""Allá en el Rancho Grande"" in 1936. The character was played by Jorge Negrete in films such as ""¡Ay, Jalisco… no te rajes!"" and ""¡Así se quiere en Jalisco!"" The main characters used his ability to sing mariachi as a way to show strength, virility, and aesthetic beauty. Its use in film also made the music popular and a symbol of ethnic pride for Mexican Americans in the United States. Its use in film also promoted a negative perception of mariachi music. The films associated the charros and mariachi music with machismo, womanizing and drinking, especially of tequila.The reason that the movies did this was that mariachi music was associated with bars and the lower classes in a number of segments of Mexican society in the early 20th century. This would change in the latter half of the 20th century, but the music remains strongly associated with tequila. Mariachi music and musician became more professional with more formal training starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s, principally due to the success of a major mariachi band by the name of Mariachi Vargas. Their appearance in many films, backing many singing stars and their hiring of a formal musician prompted other mariachis to do the same. The band also expanded adding trumpets, violins and even a classical guitar to become a kind of orchestra, keeping the traditional son/mariachi base while integrating new musical ideas and styles. One other innovation, in contrast to the machismo of the style were the first female mariachi performers, Lola Beltrán and Lucha Villa. One night Mariachi Vargas put Beltrán on stage when she was a teenager. her versions of “Cucurrucucu Paloma” and “Tres Dias” are now considered classics. Many of the traditional sounds of Cocula were lost as mariachi groups incorporated other musical styles that were popular on the radio. New influences have come into the tradition from the Mexican American community in the United States. In both countries, however, the learning of traditional pieces and repertory is still stressed to form a base. The International Mariachi Festival in Guadalajara is an annual ten-day event which attracts more than 500 mariachis performing in concert halls and streets of the city. Past players include Marichi Vargas de Tecalitlán, Nati Cano’s Mariachi Los Camperos and Mariachi América. In Mexico City, the center of mariachi music remains Garibaldi Plaza. The plaza fills with mariachi musicians to solicit gigs from individual songs for passers-by to being hired for events such as weddings and baptisms. They even stand on Eje Central in front of the plaza to flag down passing cars. In 2010, the government renovated the plaza to make it more tourist-friendly, adding new paving, gardens, police, security cameras, painted facades, and a museum dedicated to mariachi and tequila. Although mariachis can be hired in Mexico City over the phone or on the internet, many people still prefer to come to the plaza, hear the musicians and haggle over the price. About 2,500 mariachis hold union cards to work in the plaza, but as many as 4,000 may circulate through on a busy weekend. In 2011 UNESCO recognized the music as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, joining six others of this list from Mexico. Bands. The size of a mariachi band varies depending on the availability of musicians. The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar. Traditional mariachi guitars include the vihuela, a high-pitched, round-backed guitar which provides rhythm, and a bass guitar called a guitarrón. There is also sometimes a Mexican folk harp which can provide bass as well as ornament the melody. All are Mexican variations of European instruments. There is generally no lead singer as in other kinds of bands with all players singing choruses and taking turns singing the lead. Often the lead singer is assigned to a certain song due to voice qualities. Mariachi vocalization shows influences from a number of styles such as bolero (a romantic style), huapango (using falsetto), son jaliscense (an aggressive style) and more. Voices need to be strong to be heard over the instruments as they are often not amplified. Vocal style emphasizes operatic qualities and instrumental performance demonstrates a level of virtuosity that reflects advanced musical training. Historically, mariachi groups have been made up of men but there is growing acceptance of female mariachis.  As mariachi bands are expected to play requests, they may need to know hundreds of different songs. Most songs are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes and even animals and country life from the genre origins as rural ""son"" music. One particularly famous song is “La Cucaracha” (The Cockroach). Most mariachi bands are associated with family and religious celebrations along with serenades. One of the most common pieces played by the bands is “Las Mañanitas” for birthday and celebrations of patron saints. In Mexico, mariachi music can be found as well as part of Catholic Mass. The Misa panamericana is a mariachi folk mass sung in Spanish with new arrangements of classic hymns such as ""Kyrie Eleison"". This innovation began in 1966 by Canadian priest Jean Marc Leclerc and it moved from a small church to the Cuernavaca Cathedral. Mariachi Bands have also now become very popular in the UK at weddings and parties. However, instead of performing traditional Mariachi standards they are adopting popular songs (by artists such as The Human League and East 17) and playing them in Mariachi style and on Mariachi instrumentation. Mariachi Vargas. Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán is recognized as the oldest and most famous mariachi ensemble, founded by Gaspar Vargas in the late 1890s. They moved from Jalisco to Mexico City and performed for the inauguration of Lázaro Cárdenas. Mariachi Vargas became famous accompanying singers such as Luis Miguel, Lola Beltrán, and Pedro Infante. Mariachi Vargas’s first recording was in 1937, the same year they appear in “Asi es mi Tierra”. They appeared in over 200 films in the 20th century. Silvestre Vargas took over Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán from his father in 1958 and soon after hired a trained musician, Rubín Fuentes, as musical director. Fuentes along with Vargas were instrumental in the standardization of much of mariachi music, arranging traditional songs and writing new ones that would be performed by many of the legendary performers of the mid-20th century, such as Pedro Infante, Miguel Aceves Mejía, Lola Beltrán and José Alfredo Jiménez. Mariachi Vargas still remains, tracing its history in terms of generations, starting in the 1890s, with these generations maintaining the group’s authenticity as a mariachi band while the music has evolved. The last Vargas associated with the group died in 1985. That the group still considers itself the original band comes from the notion of passing on the music by generations of musicians, how the original song jaliscense was learned.  United States. The promotion of mariachi as representative of Mexico has led to the formation of mariachi groups in many countries such as Aruba, Egypt, Cuba, Spain, Croatia, Sweden, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, with bands from these and more countries participating in Guadalajara’s International Mariachi and Charreria Conference. The music has a strong following in the United States and top bands spend a lot of time on tour.Mariachi Los Camperos has received a Grammy nomination for best Mexican-American album. Academic programs allow for instruction by famous mariachi bands and the opportunity to win awards. The creation of mariachi groups in the United States began in California. Nati Cano was born in Jalisco in 1939 and moved to Los Angeles in 1959. He played in many mariachi bands backing singers but felt mariachi could stand alone. In 1969 he opened a restaurant called La Fonda in Los Angeles which featured his band called Los Camperos as part of a dinner show. The success of this enterprise and of Los Camperos in general have since inspired many mariachi bands in the United States. In the late 1980s, pop star Linda Ronstadt recorded ""Canciones de Mi Padre"" and ""Más Canciones"" with Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán and others which helped to promote its popularity among Mexican Americans and to non-Mexican Americans as well. Some U.S. public schools offer mariachi as part of band classes. The first student mariachi band was begun in 1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles. This prompted the creation of other student organizations in other parts of California and then in Texas, where the first mariachi festival was held in 1979. Since then, there has been a strong synergy between academic programs and mariachi festivals which feature students and give mariachi classes and workshops. Once school programs were limited to border areas such as San Antonio and Tucson but they have spread across the southwest and into other parts of the country, especially since the 1990s. There are at least 500 schools offering classes along with local and state competitions. In some US schools, mariachi ensembles have replaced school bands. Professional groups such as Mariachi Cobre, which regularly performs at Disney World, also spend time teaching in public schools. In areas with large Mexican-American populations, mariachis are being hired for events outside this ethnic group as well. Outside of schools, the most important venue for the music in the United States is mariachi festivals with the longest running festivals in Tucson and Fresno. The Tucson International Mariachi Conference began in 1982. It originally was held in the downtown but in 2012 moved to the Casino Del Sol. It showcases over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools and college mariachi players. The Las Vegas International Mariachi Festival, established in 1991, is televised on Telemundo and PBS and has headlined artists such as Pedro Fernández, Ana Gabriel, and American born mariachi singer Pepe Aguilar and more. Some consider the educational movement to be controversial with some trained the traditional manner looking down upon these programs and their potential to change the tradition. The changes, especially standardization of publishing, are slowing impacting mariachi in Mexico. One difficulty of arranging mariachi pieces is that the son jaliscense it is based on alternates between 3/4 and 6/8 time. Much of the published mariachi music is meant for people already familiar with the music to serve as guides, not to novices. On the other hand, many schools have problems recruiting mariachi instructors as many of these do not have required teaching credentials. For this reason, schools often hire trained musicians from outside the mariachi tradition. Many traditional mariachis are concerned that standardization will lead to fossilization and restrict improvisation.  Other innovations in the United States have been the incorporation of styles of artists such as Elvis Presley, Freddy Fender and Glenn Miller. Another is the encouragement of female mariachis including all-female mariachi bands such as Mariachi Mujer 2000 and Mariachi Divas. Mariachi Mujer has performed with Mexican artists such as Vikki Carr, Pablo Montero, Gerardito Fernandez and Nydia Rojas. Mariachi Divas have toured extensively in the United States and perform regularly at Disneyland and California Adventure in Anaheim . Dance. Mariachi’s beginning as a son meant that it was originally a form of dance music and dancing is still important to mariachi. The most common dance technique found with mariachi is zapateado, a kind of footwork from Spain with pounding movements into a raised platform with often provides the percussion rhythm of mariachi and son music. The dance performed varies by region. Another dance style associated with both son and mariachi is jarabe, including the jarabe tapatío or Mexican hat dance. "
wikipedia-363695," BLAST  In bioinformatics, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, or BLAST, is an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of different proteins or the nucleotides of DNA sequences. A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences, and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold. Different types of BLASTs are available according to the query sequences. For example, following the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the mouse, a scientist will typically perform a BLAST search of the human genome to see if humans carry a similar gene; BLAST will identify sequences in the human genome that resemble the mouse gene based on similarity of sequence. The BLAST program was designed by Stephen Altschul, Warren Gish, Webb Miller, Eugene Myers, and David J. Lipman at the NIH and was published in the ""Journal of Molecular Biology"" in 1990. Background. BLAST is one of the most widely used bioinformatics programs, because it addresses a fundamental problem and the heuristic algorithm it uses is much faster than calculating an optimal alignment. This emphasis on speed is vital to making the algorithm practical on the huge genome databases currently available, although subsequent algorithms can be even faster. Before fast algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA were developed, doing database searches for protein or nucleic sequences was very time consuming because a full alignment procedure (e.g., the Smith–Waterman algorithm) was used. While BLAST is faster than Smith-Waterman, it cannot ""guarantee the optimal alignments of the query and database sequences"" as Smith-Waterman does. The optimality of Smith-Waterman ""ensured the best performance on accuracy and the most precise results"" at the expense of time and computer power. BLAST is more time-efficient than FASTA by searching only for the more significant patterns in the sequences, yet with comparative sensitivity. This could be further realized by understanding the algorithm of BLAST introduced below. Examples of other questions that researchers use BLAST to answer are: BLAST is also often used as part of other algorithms that require approximate sequence matching. The BLAST algorithm and the computer program that implements it were developed by Stephen Altschul, Warren Gish, and David Lipman at the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Webb Miller at the Pennsylvania State University, and Gene Myers at the University of Arizona. It is available on the web on the NCBI website. Alternative implementations include AB-BLAST (formerly known as WU-BLAST), FSA-BLAST (last updated in 2006), and ScalaBLAST. The original paper by Altschul, ""et al."" was the most highly cited paper published in the 1990s. Input. Input sequences are in FASTA or Genbank format and weight matrix. Output. BLAST output can be delivered in a variety of formats. These formats include HTML, plain text, and XML formatting. For NCBI's web-page, the default format for output is HTML. When performing a BLAST on NCBI, the results are given in a graphical format showing the hits found, a table showing sequence identifiers for the hits with scoring related data, as well as alignments for the sequence of interest and the hits received with corresponding BLAST scores for these. The easiest to read and most informative of these is probably the table. If one is attempting to search for a proprietary sequence or simply one that is unavailable in databases available to the general public through sources such as NCBI, there is a BLAST program available for download to any computer, at no cost. This can be found at BLAST+ executables. There are also commercial programs available for purchase. Databases can be found from the NCBI site, as well as from Index of BLAST databases (FTP). Process. Using a heuristic method, BLAST finds similar sequences, not by comparing either sequence in its entirety, but rather by locating short matches between the two sequences. This process of finding initial words is called seeding. It is after this first match that BLAST begins to make local alignments. While attempting to find similarity in sequences, sets of common letters, known as words, are very important. For example, suppose that the sequence contains the following stretch of letters, GLKFA. If a BLASTp was being conducted under default conditions, the word size would be 3 letters. In this case, using the given stretch of letters, the searched words would be GLK, LKF, KFA. The heuristic algorithm of BLAST locates all common three-letter words between the sequence of interest and the hit sequence, or sequences, from the database. These results will then be used to build an alignment. After making words for the sequence of interest, neighborhood words are also assembled. These words must satisfy a requirement of having a score of at least the threshold ""T"", when compared by using a scoring matrix. One commonly-used scoring matrix for BLASTp searches is BLOSUM62, although the optimal scoring matrix depends on sequence similarity. Once both words and neighborhood words are assembled and compiled, they are compared to the sequences in the database in order to find matches. The threshold score ""T"" determines, whether a particular word will be included in the alignment or not. Once seeding has been conducted, the alignment, which is only 3 residues long, is extended in both directions by the algorithm used by BLAST. Each extension impacts the score of the alignment by either increasing or decreasing it. Should this score be higher than a pre-determined ""T"", the alignment will be included in the results given by BLAST. However, should this score be lower than this pre-determined ""T"", the alignment will cease to extend, preventing areas of poor alignment from being included in the BLAST results. Note, that increasing the ""T"" score limits the amount of space available to search, decreasing the number of neighborhood words, while at the same time speeding up the process of BLAST. Algorithm. To run, BLAST requires a query sequence to search for, and a sequence to search against (also called the target sequence) or a sequence database containing multiple such sequences. BLAST will find sub-sequences in the database which are similar to subsequences in the query. In typical usage, the query sequence is much smaller than the database, e.g., the query may be one thousand nucleotides while the database is several billion nucleotides. The main idea of BLAST is that there are often high-scoring segment pairs (HSP) contained in a statistically significant alignment. BLAST searches for high scoring sequence alignments between the query sequence and sequences in the database using a heuristic approach that approximates the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The exhaustive Smith-Waterman approach is too slow for searching large genomic databases such as GenBank. Therefore, the BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach that is less accurate than the Smith-Waterman algorithm but over 50 times faster. The speed and relatively good accuracy of BLAST are among the key technical innovations of the BLAST programs. An overview of the BLASTP algorithm (a protein to protein search) is as follows: Parallel BLAST. Parallel BLAST versions are implemented using MPI and Pthreads, and have been ported to various platforms including Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and AIX. Popular approaches to parallelize BLAST include query distribution, hash table segmentation, computation parallelization, and database segmentation (partition). Program. The BLAST program can either be downloaded and run as a command-line utility ""blastall"" or accessed for free over the web. The BLAST web server, hosted by the NCBI, allows anyone with a web browser to perform similarity searches against constantly updated databases of proteins and DNA that include most of the newly sequenced organisms. The BLAST program is based on an open-source format, giving everyone access to it and enabling them to have the ability to change the program code. This has led to the creation of several BLAST ""spin-offs"". There are now a handful of different BLAST programs available, which can be used depending on what one is attempting to do and what they are working with. These different programs vary in query sequence input, the database being searched, and what is being compared. These programs and their details are listed below: BLAST is actually a family of programs (all included in the blastall executable). These include: Of these programs, because they use direct comparisons, and do not require translations. However, since protein sequences are better conserved evolutionarily than nucleotide sequences, tBLASTn, tBLASTx, and BLASTx, produce more reliable and accurate results when dealing with coding DNA. They also enable one to be able to directly see the function of the protein sequence, since by translating the sequence of interest before searching often gives you annotated protein hits. Alternative versions. A version designed for comparing multiple large genomes or chromosomes is BLASTZ. CS-BLAST (context-specific BLAST) is an extended version of BLAST for searching protein sequences that finds twice as many remotely related sequences as BLAST at the same speed and error rate. In CS-BLAST, the mutation probabilities between amino acids depend not only on the single amino acid, as in BLAST, but also on its local sequence context (the six left and six right sequence neighbors). Washington University produced an alternative to NCBI BLAST, called WU-BLAST. The rights have since been transferred to Advanced Biocomputing, LLC. In 2009, NCBI has released a new set of BLAST executables, the C++ based BLAST+, and has released parallel versions until 2.2.26. Starting with version 2.2.27 (April 2013), only BLAST+ executables are available. Among the changes is the replacement of the codice_1 executable with separate executables for the different BLAST programs, and changes in option handling. The formatdb utility (C based) has been replaced by makeblastdb (C++ based) and databases formatted by either one should be compatible for identical blast releases. The algorithms remain similar, however, the number of hits found and their order can vary significantly between the older and the newer version. Alternatives to BLAST. An extremely fast but considerably less sensitive alternative to BLAST is BLAT (Blast Like Alignment Tool). While BLAST does a linear search, BLAT relies on k-mer indexing the database, and can thus often find seeds faster. Advances in sequencing technology in the late 2000s has made searching for very similar nucleotide matches an important problem. New alignment programs tailored for this use typically use BWT-indexing of the target database (typically a genome). Input sequences can then be mapped very quickly, and output is typically in the form of a BAM file. Example alignment programs are BWA, SOAP, and Bowtie. For protein identification, searching for known domains (for instance from Pfam) by matching with Hidden Markov Models is a popular alternative, such as HMMER. Uses of BLAST. BLAST can be used for several purposes. These include identifying species, locating domains, establishing phylogeny, DNA mapping, and comparison. Comparing BLAST and the Smith-Waterman Process. While both Smith-Waterman and BLAST are used to find homologous sequences by searching and comparing a query sequence with those in the databases, they do have their differences. Due to the fact that BLAST is based on a heuristic algorithm, the results received through BLAST, in terms of the hits found, may not be the best possible results, as it will not provide you with all the hits within the database. BLAST misses hard to find matches. A better alternative in order to find the best possible results would be to use the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This method varies from the BLAST method in two areas, accuracy and speed. The Smith-Waterman option provides better accuracy, in that it finds matches that BLAST cannot, because it does not miss any information. Therefore, it is necessary for remote homology. However, when compared to BLAST, it is more time consuming, not to mention that it requires large amounts of computer usage and space. However, technologies to speed up the Smith-Waterman process have been found to improve the time necessary to perform a search dramatically. These technologies include FPGA chips and SIMD technology. In order to receive better results from BLAST, the settings can be changed from their default settings. However, there is no given or set way of changing these settings in order to receive the best results for a given sequence. The settings available for change are E-Value, gap costs, filters, word size, and substitution matrix. Note, that the algorithm used for BLAST was developed from the algorithm used for Smith-Waterman. BLAST employs an alignment which finds ""local alignments between sequences by finding short matches and from these initial matches (local) alignments are created"". "
wikipedia-363697," X.400  X.400 is a suite of ITU-T Recommendations that define standards for Data Communication Networks for Message Handling Systems (MHS) — more commonly known as ""email"". At one time X.400 was expected to be the predominant form of email, but this role has been taken by the SMTP-based Internet e-mail. Despite this, it has been widely used within organizations and was a core part of Microsoft Exchange Server until 2006; variants continue to be important in military and aviation contexts. History. The first X.400 Recommendations were published in 1984 (""Red Book""), and a substantially revised version was published in 1988 (""Blue Book""). New features were added in 1992 (""White Book"") and subsequent updates. Although X.400 was originally designed to run over the , an adaptation to allow operation over TCP/IP, RFC 1006, has become the most popular way to run X.400. Developed in cooperation with the ISO, the X.400-series recommendations specify OSI standard protocols for exchanging and addressing electronic messages. The companion F.400-series of recommendations define Message Handling Services built on Message Handling Systems (MHS), as well as access to and from the MHS for public services. In the late 1990s the ITU-T consolidated recommendations F.400 and X.400 and published the ITU-T F.400/X.400 (06/1999) recommendation ""Message handling system and service overview"". The X.400-series recommendations define the technical aspects of the MHS: ITU-T Rec. X.402 | (ISO/IEC 10021-2) defines the overall system architecture of an MHS, ITU-T Rec. X.411 | (ISO/IEC 10021-4) defines the Message Transfer Service (MTS) and its functional component the Message Transfer Agent (MTA), and ITU-T Rec. X.413 | (ISO/IEC 10021-5) defines the Message Store. All ITU-T recommendations provide specific terms for descriptions of system entities and procedures. For example, messages (email) exchanged among people is referred to as Interpersonal Messaging (IPM); electronically structured business documents (e.g., invoices, purchase orders, dispatch advice, etc.) exchanged among trading partners’ computers fall under the EDI protocols. As with most ISO standards dealing with application-level networking, X.400 failed to compete successfully with SMTP, the Internet-based equivalent in North America. However, in Europe, South America, and Asia, X.400 is quite widely implemented, especially for EDI services. In North America X.400 is still used in some applications, such as the military, intelligence services and aviation, mainly because the X.400 functions for integrity and security were developed and deployed much earlier than their SMTP counterparts (S/MIME, PGP and SMTP-TLS). For similar reasons it is sometimes used for transmission of EDI messages between applications. Message handling is a distributed information processing task that integrates two related subtasks: message transfer and message storage. The ITU-T Recommendations define specific protocols for a wide-range of communication tasks. For example, the P1 protocol is used explicitly for communication among MTAs, P3 between the user agent and an MTA, and P7 between the user agent and message store. In the 1994 version P7 was enhanced to provide folders in the message store, allow storage of submitted messages, and provide many automatic actions such as auto-foldering and correlation of replies, delivery reports and receipt notifications with submitted messages. X.400 message content standards are defined for communication between user agents. These are modelled as conceptual protocols that treat P1 and P3/P7 as providing an underlying reliable transport of message contents. The message content standard for interpersonal messaging, IPM, defined in ITU-T Rec. X.420 | ISO/IEC 10021-7 was named P2 in the Red Book. The extended version of IPM in the Blue Book was given content-type 22 (for P2 version 2) and is often referred to informally as P22, although that term is not used in the standards. The message content standard for EDI is defined in ITU-T Rec. F.435 | ISO/IEC 10021-8 and ITU-T Rec. X.435 | ISO/IEC 10021-9, and informally referred to as P35. A voice messaging content type is defined in ITU-T Recs. F.440 and X.440. Exchange Server 2007 does not use the MTA object and the X.400 connector (which must use the MTA) is gone in Exchange Server 2007. There are no longer any X.400 default proxy e-mail addresses in Exchange Server 2007. Important features of X.400 include structured addressing, ASN.1 binary code enabling multimedia content (predating and more efficient than MIME), and integrated security capabilities. As X.400 inter-domain relay services were assumed by ITU to be run by PTTs, X.400 incorporated fields for the automated transfer of messages between X.400 and other PTT services, such as Telex, facsimile and physical postal mail. ISO later added open routing standards (ITU-T Rec. X.412 | ISO/IEC 10021-10 and ITU-T Rec. X.404 | ISO/IEC 10021-11), but the initial misconception that X.400 required PTT relay services, coupled with PTT volume-based charges for these, were factors that inhibited the widespread uptake of X.400. X.400 has been extended for use in military applications (see MMHS) and aviation (see AMHS). Addressing. An X.400 address is technically referred to as an Originator/Recipient (OR) address. It has two purposes: Mailbox identification - either the originator or recipient. Global domain identification - where a given mailbox is located. An X.400 address consists of several elements, including: The standards themselves originally did not specify how these email addresses should be written (for instance on a business card); RFC 1685 specified one encoding, based on a 1993 draft of ITU-T Recommendation F.401 which looked like: 1984 had two forms for address formats: In the 1988 X.400 Recommendations, four forms of addressing were delineated. The 1984 Form 1, Variant 1 format was renamed as the mnemonic O/R address and the 1984 Form 1, Variant 3 and Form 2 format were combined and renamed the terminal O/R address. New forms introduced were the numeric O/R form (a variation of Form 1, Variant 2) and the postal O/R address. The unwieldiness of this addressing format is believed by many to be one factor in the lack of success of X.400. External links. X.400 Standards. X.400 standards are available free from ITU-T "
wikipedia-363701," Unknown Pleasures  Unknown Pleasures is the debut studio album by English post-punk band Joy Division. It was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport in April 1979, with Martin Hannett as producer, and was released on 15 June 1979 by Factory Records. It followed an abandoned album for RCA Records. No singles were released from ""Unknown Pleasures"", though the release of ""Transmission"" boosted its sales, despite the album failing to chart at the time. Background. Joy Division formed in Salford, Greater Manchester in 1976 during the first wave of punk rock. Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook had separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall on 4 June 1976, and both embraced that group's simplicity, speed and aggression. Forming a band with their friend Terry Mason on drums, Sumner on guitar and Hook on bass, they advertised for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who Sumner and Hook already knew, applied and, without having to audition, was taken on. After a number of changes of drummer, Stephen Morris joined the band—at that time called Warsaw—in August 1977. To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, they renamed themselves Joy Division in late 1977. After signing with RCA Records in early 1978, Joy Division recorded some demos; however, they were unhappy with the way their music was mixed and asked to be released from their contract. The band's first recording was the self-produced extended play (EP), ""An Ideal for Living"", which was released in June 1978. They made their television debut on Tony Wilson's local news show ""Granada Reports"" in September 1978. According to Hook, the band received a £70,000 offer from Genetic Records in London. However, the band's manager, Rob Gretton, approached Wilson about releasing an album on his Factory Records label. Wilson explained that Gretton had calculated that with Factory's 50/50 split of profits, the group could make as much money with the indie label as it could signed to a major label. Wilson added that one of Gretton's main reasons for approaching Factory about an album release was so ""he wouldn't have to get on a train to London every week and 'talk to cunts'. No one could use the word 'cockney' with as much contempt as Rob"". Gretton calculated that the album would cost £8,000 to produce; however, Wilson said in 2006 that the final up-front cost was £18,000. Recording. ""Unknown Pleasures"" was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, England between 1 and 17 April 1979, with Martin Hannett producing. Describing Hannett's production techniques, Hook said, ""didn't think straight, he thought sideways. He confused you and made you do something you didn't expect."" Hook went on to say, ""Derek Bramwood of Strawberry Studios said that you can take a group that have got on brilliantly for 20 years, put them in a studio with Martin and within five minutes, they'll be trying to slash each other's throats."" However, Hook went on to say that Hannett was only as good as the material he had to work with, ""We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients."" Hannett used a number of unusual sound effects and production techniques on the album; including the sound of a bottle smashing, someone eating crisps, backwards guitar and the sound of the Strawberry Studios lift with a Leslie speaker ""whirring inside"". He also used the sound of a basement toilet, as well as an ASM Neve (a prototype digital delay), tape echo and bounce. Hannett recorded Curtis's vocals for ""Insight"" down a telephone line so he could achieve the ""requisite distance"". Referring to the recording sessions, Hook remembered, ""Sumner started using a kit-built Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser, most notably on 'I Remember Nothing', where it vied with the sound of Rob Gretton smashing bottles with Steve and his Walther replica pistol."" He continued, ""Morris ... had invested in a syndrum because he thought he saw one on the cover of Can's ""Tago Mago"": ""you triggered it by hitting it. frowned on it because he wasn't the one doing the triggering."" The band members' opinions differed on the ""spacious, atmospheric sound"" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Sumner said, ""The music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars. The production inflicted this dark, doomy mood over the album: we'd drawn this picture in black and white, and Martin had coloured it in for us. We resented it ..."" Hook said, ""I couldn't hide my disappointment then, it sounded like Pink Floyd."" Morris disagreed, saying, ""I was happy with ""Unknown Pleasures"". My theory on things at the time was that the two things—listening to a record and going to a gig—were quite different. You don't want to hear a record when you go to a gig: you want something with a bit of energy."" Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett's work. Hook conceded in 2006, ""It definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it ... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it ... There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound."" Hook also noted that he was able to hear Curtis's lyrics and Sumner's guitar parts for the first time on the record, because during gigs the band played too loudly. In 1994 Jon Savage described the music as ""a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic"". Analysing Curtis's work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: ""sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything's (perhaps) lost"". Packaging. Author Chris Ott stated that the album title was likely a reference to Marcel Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past"". Peter Saville, who had previously designed posters for Manchester's Factory club in 1978, designed the cover of the album. Morris chose the image used on the cover, which is based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from ""The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy"". Saville reversed the image from black-on-white to white-on-black and printed it on textured card for the original version of the album.  This image became well-known, featuring on t-shirts (even parodied by a quickly-withdrawn Disney shirt). When reviewing the 2007 remastered version of ""Unknown Pleasures"", Pitchfork Media critic Joshua Klein described the cover art as ""iconic"". Susie Goldring, reviewing the album for BBC Online said, ""The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes. Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will."" The inner sleeve features a black-and-white photograph of a door with a hand near the handle. It was some years later before Saville discovered that the photograph was ""Hand Through a Doorway"", a well-known picture by Ralph Gibson. Releases. ""Unknown Pleasure"" was initially printed in a run of 10,000 copies. Sales for the album were slow until the release of the non-LP ""Transmission"" single, and unsold copies occupied the Factory Records office and the apartment of label co-founder Alan Erasmus. Following the release of the single, the album sold out of its initial pressing in the space of weeks, and prompted further pressings. ""Unknown Pleasures"" created approximately £50,000 in profit to be shared between Factory and the band; however, Tony Wilson spent most of it on Factory projects. By the conclusion of a critically acclaimed promotional tour supporting Buzzcocks in November 1979, ""Unknown Pleasures"" had neared 15,000 copies sold. ""Unknown Pleasures"" failed to chart on the UK Albums Chart. However, following Curtis's suicide in May 1980 and the release of their second album, ""Closer"", in July, it was reissued and reached number seventy-one that August. It fared better on the UK Indie Chart, placing at number two on the first chart to be published in January 1980 and going on to top the chart following its reissue, spending 136 weeks on the chart in total. In 2007, a remastered version of ""Unknown Pleasures"" along with ""Closer"" and the posthumous compilation album ""Still"" (1981) was re-released. The remastered album included a bonus disc of a live recording of the band playing at The Factory in Manchester on 13 July 1979. The album was also re-released on 180-gram vinyl with the original track listing in 2007, with this version also being available in a limited edition box set with ""Closer"" and ""Still"". Critical reception and legacy. Reviewing the album for ""Melody Maker"", Jon Savage called ""Unknown Pleasures"" an ""opaque manifesto"" and declared ""the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgize, Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year."" Max Bell of ""NME"" hailed the album, positively citing ""Strange Days""-era Doors and the ""German experimentalists"" of Can and Neu!. By August of that year the album's stature as a favorite of critics for the year was established. Writing about Factory for ""Melody Maker"" in September 1979, Mary Harron was less impressed: ""I found at least half of [""Unknown Pleasures""] to be turgid and monotonous, and the vocals heavy and melodramatic—Jim Morrison without flair."" She went on to say the lyrics and the atmosphere of the album ""seemed to hearken back to the late Sixties"" and the songs were ""a series of disconnected images"". Awarding the album four stars out of five in his 1981 review for ""Rolling Stone"", music journalist Mikal Gilmore described the album as having ""a doleful, deep-toned sound that often suggested an elaborate version of the Velvet Underground or an orderly Public Image Ltd."" Awarding the album A− in his ""Consumer Guide Review"" for ""The Village Voice"", Robert Christgau said that it was Curtis's ""passionate gravity that makes the clumsy, disquieting music so convincing"". Ned Raggett reviewing the album for Allmusic years later described the album as ""All visceral, all emotional, all theatrical, all perfect—one of the best albums ever."" In relation to the remastered re-released album in 2007, the writer for British music magazine NME described the album as ""simply one of the best records ever made, and is still powerful enough to floor you 28 years on"". The reviewer went on to say, ""The album's raw power is still gripping, most notably on the haunting 'Day of the Lords' and 'She's Lost Control'."" Since its release, ""Unknown Pleasures"" has received a number of accolades from the music press. Describing the album as ""punk on the edge of goth, with echoes of disco and the Doors"", ""Rolling Stone"" ranked the album at number twenty-four in its list of the ""50 Coolest Records"". ""Spin"" has ranked the album at number eleven in its list of the ""50 Most Essential Punk Records"", as well as including it in its lists of the ""Fifteen Most Influential Albums"" and the ""Top Ten College Cult Classics"". In the March 2003 issues of ""Mojo"", the album was listed at number 26 in its ""Top 50 Punk Albums"". ""Q"" magazine placed the album at number 19 in its list of the ""100 Greatest British Albums"". ""NME"" ranked the album at number four in its list of ""The Greatest Albums of the '70s"" and at number forty-three in its list of the ""Greatest Albums of All Time"". Track listing.

wikipedia-363703," Reed–Sternberg cell  Reed–Sternberg cells (also known as lacunar histiocytes for certain types) are different giant cells found with light microscopy in biopsies from individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma (aka Hodgkin's disease; a type of lymphoma). They are usually derived from B lymphocytes, classically considered crippled germinal center B cells, meaning they have not undergone hypermutation to express their antibody. Seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a moth-eaten appearance. They are named after Dorothy Reed Mendenhall and Carl Sternberg, who provided the first definitive microscopic descriptions of Hodgkin's disease. Reed–Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bilobed nucleus (thus resembling an ""owl's eye"" appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. Reed–Sternberg cells are CD30 and CD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma – the absence of Reed–Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis, carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very often in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A special type of Reed–Sternberg cells is the ""lacunar histiocyte"", whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called ""lacunae"") between them. These are characteristic of the nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma. "
wikipedia-363709," Burkitt's lymphoma  Burkitt's lymphoma (or ""Burkitt's tumor"", Burkitt lymphoma or ""malignant lymphoma, Burkitt's type"") is a cancer of the lymphatic system (in particular, B lymphocytes). It is named after Denis Parsons Burkitt, a surgeon who first described the disease in 1956 while working in equatorial Africa. Classification. Currently Burkitt's lymphoma can be divided into three main clinical variants: the endemic, the sporadic and the immunodeficiency-associated variants.  By morphology (i.e. microscopic appearance) or immunophenotype, it is almost impossible to differentiate these three clinical variants. Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma may demonstrate more plasmacytic appearance or more pleomorphism, but these features are not specific. Epidemiology. Of all cancers involving the same class of blood cell, 2.3% of cases are Burkitt's lymphoma. Malignant B cell characteristics. Normal B cells possess rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, and each isolated B-cell possesses a unique IgH gene rearrangement. Since Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas are a clonal proliferative process, all tumor cells from one patient are supposed to possess identical IgH genes. When the DNA of tumor cells is analyzed using electrophoresis, a clonal band can be demonstrated, since identical IgH genes will move to the same position. On the contrary, when a normal or reactive lymph node is analyzed using the same technique, a smear rather than a distinct band will be seen. This technique is useful since sometimes benign reactive processes (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) and malignant lymphoma can be difficult to distinguish. Microscopy. The tumor consists of sheets of a monotonous (i.e. similar in size and morphology) population of medium size lymphoid cells with high proliferative activity and apoptotic activity. The ""starry sky"" appearance seen under low power is due to scattered tingible body-laden macrophages (macrophages containing dead body of apoptotic tumor cells). The old descriptive term of ""small non-cleaved cell"" is misleading. The tumor cells are mostly medium in size (i.e. tumor nuclei size similar to that of histiocytes or endothelial cells). ""Small non-cleaved cells"" are compared to ""large non-cleaved cells"" of normal germinal center lymphocytes. Tumor cells possess small amount of basophilic cytoplasm. The cellular outline usually appears squared off. Immunohistochemistry. The tumor cells in Burkitt lymphoma generally strongly express markers of B cell differentiation (CD20, CD22, CD19) as well as CD10, and BCL6. The tumour cells are generally negative for BCL2 and TdT. The high mitotic activity of Burkitt lymphoma is confirmed by nearly 100% of the cells staining positive for Ki67. Genetics. All types of Burkitt's lymphoma are characterized by disregulation of the c-myc gene by one of three chromosomal translocations. This gene is found at 8q24. Combined, the two less-common translocations, t(2;8)(p12;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11), account for the remaining 15% of cases not due to the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation. Gene targets. Unique genetic alterations promote cell survival in Burkitt lymphoma, distinct from other types of lymphoma.  These TCF3 and ID3 gene mutations in Burkitt correspond to a cell survival pathway that may be found to be amenable to targeted therapy. Treatment. Treatment may be dose-adjusted EPOCH with Rituxan (rituximab) or the modified Magrath regimen (R-CODOX-M/IVAC). The effects of the chemotherapy, as with all cancers, depend on the time of diagnosis. With faster growing cancers, such as Burkitt's, the cancer actually responds faster than with slower growing cancers. This rapid response to chemotherapy can be hazardous to the patient, as a phenomenon called ""tumor lysis syndrome"" could occur. Close monitoring of the patient and adequate hydration is essential during the process. Chemotherapy  Other treatments are immunotherapy, bone marrow transplants, stem cell transplant, surgery to remove the tumor, and radiotherapy. Prognosis. Treatment with dose-adjusted EPOCH with Rituxan (rituximab) has shown an 8 year survival rate of 91% for low risk, 90% for low-intermediate risk, 67% for high-intermediate risk, and 31% for high risk cases with few of the side effects associated with Burkitt's lymphoma chemotherapy.

wikipedia-363720," Leslie Marmon Silko  Leslie Marmon Silko (born Leslie Marmon; March 5, 1948) is a Native American writer of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, and one of the key figures in the First Wave of what literary critic Kenneth Lincoln has called the ""Native American Renaissance."" Silko was an original recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Grant, now known as the ""Genius Grant"", in 1981 and the Native Writers' Circle of the Americas Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. She currently resides in Tucson, Arizona. Early life. Leslie Marmon Silko was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Leland Howard Marmon, a noted photographer, and Mary Virginia Leslie. Silko has noted herself as being 1/4 Laguna Pueblo (a Keres speaking tribe), also identifying as Anglo American and Mexican American. Silko grew up on the edge of pueblo society both literally – her family’s house was at the edge of the Laguna Pueblo reservation – and figuratively, as she was not permitted to participate in various tribal rituals or join any of the pueblo's religious societies. Silko learned much of the traditional stories of the Laguna people from her grandmother, whom she called A'mooh, her aunt Susie, and her grandfather Hank during her early years. As a result, Silko has always identified most strongly with her Laguna ancestry, stating in an interview with Alan Velie, ""I am of mixed-breed ancestry, but what I know is Laguna"". Silko was educated at a Catholic school in Albuquerque, and went on to receive a BA from the University of New Mexico in 1969. She briefly attended the University of New Mexico law school before leaving to pursue her literary career. In 1965, she married Richard C. Chapman, and together, they had a son, Robert Chapman, before divorcing in 1969. In 1971, she and John Silko were married. They had a son, Kazimir Silko. This marriage too ended in divorce. Early Literary Work. Silko garnered early literary acclaim for the short story ""The Man to Send Rain Clouds,"" which was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Discovery Grant. The story is still frequently anthologized today. During the years 1968 to 1974, Silko wrote and published more short stories and many poems, most of which were later featured in her book ""Laguna Woman."" ""Ceremony"". Leslie Marmon Silko's novel ""Ceremony"" was first published by Penguin in March 1977 to much critical acclaim. The novel tells the story of Tayo, a veteran of Laguna and white ancestry returning from fighting against Japan in World War II. Upon returning to the poverty-stricken Laguna reservation after a stint at a Los Angeles VA hospital recovering from injuries sustained in World War II, Tayo continues to suffer from ""battle fatigue"" (shell-shock), and is haunted by memories of his cousin Rocky who died in the conflict during the Bataan Death March of 1942. Seeking an escape from his pain, Tayo initially takes refuge in alcoholism. However, with the support of Old Grandma, he is helped by ceremonies conducted by the mixed-blood Navajo shaman Betonie. As a result, Tayo comes to a greater understanding of the world and his own place within it as a Laguna man. ""Ceremony"" has been called a Grail fiction, wherein the hero overcomes a series of challenges to reach a specified goal; but this point of view has been criticized as Eurocentric, since it involves a Native American contextualizing backdrop, and not one based on European-American myths. Silko's skill as a writer is evident in the way in which the novel is deeply rooted in traditional stories (for instance, there are several retellings of old stories). Fellow Pueblo poet Paula Gunn Allen criticized the book on this account, saying that Silko was divulging tribal secrets she did not have the right to reveal. These claims have been contested, noting the public circulation and availability of the oral narratives from anthropological texts published in the early twentieth century. ""Ceremony"" gained immediate and long-term success following the end of the Vietnam as veterans took to the novel's message of healing and reconciliation between races and people in order to cope with the trauma of the military campaign. It was largely on the strength of this work that critic Alan Velie named Silko one of his ""Four Native American Literary Masters"", along with N. Scott Momaday, Gerald Vizenor and James Welch. ""Ceremony"" remains one of the Native American novels featured most on college and university syllabi, and one of the few individual works by any Native American author to have received book-length critical assessments. 1980s. ""Storyteller"". In 1981, Silko released ""Storyteller"", a collection of poems and short stories, incorporating creative writing, mythology, and autobiography, which garnered favorable reception as it followed in much the same poetic form as the novel Ceremony. ""Delicacy and Strength of Lace"". In 1986, ""Delicacy and Strength of Lace"" was released. The book is a collected volume of correspondence between Silko and her friend James Wright whom she met following the publication of ""Ceremony"". The work was edited by Wright's wife, Ann Wright, and released following his death in March 1980. 1990s. ""Almanac of the Dead"". ""Almanac of the Dead"" was published in 1991. This work took Silko ten years to complete and received mixed reviews. The vision of the book stretched over both American continents and included Chiapas revolutionaries the Zapatista Army of National Liberation as just a small part of the pantheon of characters. The theme of the novel, like ""Ceremony"", focuses on the conflict between Anglo-Americans and Native Americans. The work was heavily criticised for its attitude towards homosexuality as Silko pens many of the major villains in the novel as gay, and for an improper interpretation and incorporation of the Popol Vuh. ""Almanac of the Dead"" has not achieved the same mainstream success as its predecessor. ""Sacred Water"". In June 1993, Silko published a limited run of ""Sacred Water"" under Flood Plain Press, a self-organizing printing venture by Silko. Each copy of ""Sacred Water"" is handmade by Silko using her personal typewriter combining written text set next to photographs taken by the author at various locations. ""Sacred Water"" is composed of autobiographical prose, poetry and pueblo mythology focusing on the importance and centrality of water to life. Silko choose ran a second limited printing of ""Sacred Water"" in 1994 in order to make the work more accessible to students and academics. This edition used more traditional printing methods for mass production. ""Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit: Essays on Native American Life Today"". ""Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit: Essays on Native American Life Today"" was published by Simon & Schuster in March 1997. The work is a collection of short stories on various topics including an autobiographical about her childhood at Laguna Pueblo and the racism she faced as a mixed blood person, stark criticism directed at President Bill Clinton regarding his immigration policies and praise for the development of and lamentation for the loss of the Aztec and Maya codices, along with commentary on Pueblo mythology among others. ""Rain"". In 1997, Silko ran a limited number of handmade books through Flood Plain Press. Like ""Sacred Water"", ""Rain"" was again a combination of short autobiographical prose and poetry set next to photographs taken by the writer. The short volume focused on the importance of rain to personal and spiritual survival in the Southwest. ""Garden In The Dunes"". ""Gardens in the Dunes"" was published in 1999. The work weaves together themes of feminism, slavery, conquest and botany, while following the story of a young girl named Indigo from the fictional ""Sand Lizard People"" in the Arizona Territory and her European travels as a summer companion to an affluent White woman named Hattie. The story is set against the back drop of the enforcement of Indian boarding schools, the California Gold Rush and the rise of the Ghost Dance Religion. 2000s. ""The Turquoise Ledge: A Memoir"". In 2010, Silko released ""The Turquoise Ledge: A Memoir"". Written using distinctive prose and overall structure influenced by Native American storytelling traditions, the book is a broad-ranging exploration not only of her Laguna Pueblo, Cherokee, Mexican and European family history but also of the natural world, suffering, insight, environmentalism and the sacred. The desert southwest setting is prominent. Although non-fiction, the stylized presentation is reminiscent of creative fiction. Essays. A longtime commentator on Native American affairs, Silko has published many non-fictional articles on Native American affairs and literature. Silko's two most famous essays are outspoken attacks on fellow writers. In ""An Old-Fashioned Indian Attack in Two Parts"", first published in Geary Hobson’s collection ""The Remembered Earth"" (1978), Silko accused Gary Snyder of profiting from Native American culture, particularly in his collection ""Turtle Island"", the name and theme of which was taken from Pueblo mythology. In 1986, Silko published a review entitled ""Here’s an Odd Artifact for the Fairy-Tale Shelf"", on Anishinaabe writer Louise Erdrich's novel ""The Beet Queen."" Silko claimed Erdrich had abandoned writing about the Native American struggle for sovereignty in exchange for writing ""self-referential,"" postmodern fiction. In 2012, the textbook, ""Rethinking Columbus,"" which includes an essay by her, was banned by the Tucson Unified School District following a statewide ban on Ethnic and Cultural Studies. "
wikipedia-363727," Honorable Service Lapel Button  The Honorable Service Lapel Button sometimes called the Honorable Service Lapel Pin was awarded to United States military service members who were discharged under honorable conditions during World War II. The award was sometimes slangily called the Ruptured duck. Sculptor Anthony de Francisci designed the award. The Department of Defense awarded the button between September 1939 and December 1946 and it was made of gilt brass, except during metal shortages during which it was made of gilt plastic. Service members who received the plastic version were later allowed to trade it in for the brass version. Design and wear. The button is approximately 7/16 inch in height and 5/8 inch in width. A cloth lozenge depicting the gold colored button design was also issued. The lozenge was approximately 1 1/2 inches in height and 3 inches in width with the ring design being approximately 1 inch in diameter. Honorably discharged veterans wore the lapel pin on the left lapel of civilian clothing and the lozenge was sewn onto the right breast of the dress uniform that they wore when being discharged. Purpose. The award served several purposes. It served as proof that the wearer was an honorable discharged veteran returning from duty. Unofficially, it was also used as an identifier to railroad, bus, and other transportation companies who offered free or subsidized transportation to returning veterans.  During World War II, members of the armed forces (unless under orders) were forbidden to possess civilian clothing. This not only made desertion more difficult but also insured that any captured service member would be treated as a prisoner of war under the rules of war (soldiers captured in a combat zones in possession of civilian clothing were liable to be treated as spies and summarily put to death). In pre-war conditions, discharged veterans typically donned civilian clothing when returning home, but this was logistically difficult during wartime and immediate post-war America. Approximately 16 million men and women served in the uniformed services during the crisis, most of whom were scheduled to be discharged within a short period of time during the general demobilization at the end of the war. Clothing was already in short supply due to cloth rationing, and the immediate clothing needs of millions of returning veterans threatened to crash an already overtaxed system. Federal law however prevented civilians, even veterans, from wearing military uniforms under most circumstances. The Honorable Service Lapel Button was created to allow returning veterans to legally continue to wear their military uniforms while at the same time identifying that they were no longer active duty personnel. The discharge insignia, embroidered onto a cloth lozenge and sewn on the right breast of the tunic, allowed its wearer to continue to wear his or her uniform for up to thirty days subsequent to discharge. Some veterans wore the pin on their civilian lapels for many years after the war's end. It also appeared on a postage stamp honoring veterans and is widely used as an unofficial symbol veteran's pride. The usage of the term ""ruptured duck"" later expanded to also refer to the individuals wearing it, as in ""that ruptured duck is flying space-available."" Presumably because these individuals were usually in a great hurry to return to their homes in the United States, the term later came into use when describing somebody or something which was moving quickly.

wikipedia-363734," Adobe Creative Suite  Adobe Creative Suite (CS) was a series of software suites of graphic design, video editing, and web development applications made or acquired by Adobe Systems. The collections consisted of various groupings of Adobe's applications (e.g., Photoshop, Acrobat, InDesign, Premiere Pro, After Effects) based on various technologies (e.g., PostScript, PDF, Flash) and organized by industry. The last version, Adobe Creative Suite 6 (CS6), was launched at a release event April 23, 2012, and released on May 7, 2012. On May 6, 2013 Adobe announced that CS6 would be the last version of the Creative Suite, and that future versions of their creative software would only be available via their Creative Cloud subscription service. Adobe also announced that it will continue to support CS6 for OS compatibility and will provide bug fixes and security updates as necessary. The Creative Suite packages were pulled from Adobe's online store, but still remain available via a section of their website.  Applications. Brief descriptions of the applications in the various Adobe Creative Suite editions: Editions. Adobe sells Creative Suite applications in five different combinations called ""editions"", these include: Adobe also sells Student and Teacher Editions (Student and Teacher Licensing) of the above suites. Starting with CS5, commercial use after graduation is now permitted worldwide. Student and Teacher versions of the software must be used only by the original purchaser (a student or teacher at the time of purchase) and the software must not be resold or given away. Below is a matrix of the applications that are bundled in each of the software suites for CS6: Adobe Flash Catalyst, Adobe Contribute, Adobe OnLocation, and Adobe Device Central, previously available in CS5.5, have been dropped from the CS6 line-up. Adobe Prelude and Adobe Encore are not released as standalone products. Adobe Encore is available as part of Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe InCopy, a word processing application that integrates with Adobe InDesign, is also part of the Creative Suite family, but is not included in any CS6 edition; it can be ordered from Adobe, third party plug-in developers, or systems integrators. In March 2013, it was reported that Adobe will no longer sell boxed copies of the Creative Suite software, instead offering digital downloads and monthly subscriptions. History. Creative Suite 1 and 2. The first version of Adobe Creative Suite was released in September 2003 and Creative Suite 2 in April 2005. The first two versions (CS and CS2) were available in two editions. The Standard Edition included: The Premium Edition also included: In January 2013, Adobe offered existing CS2 users the opportunity to download a version of CS2 that no longer required Adobe server authorization. Due to Adobe's closing of the CS2 activation servers on December 15, 2012, this release allowed existing users of CS2 to reinstall their licensed copies without needing authorization from the now-closed servers. Though Adobe was careful to note that the CS2 serial number provided with the download was only for people who had ""legitimately purchased CS2"", many users ignored this warning and began treating CS2 as freeware. Creative Suite Production Studio. Adobe Creative Suite Production Studio (previously ""Adobe Video Collection"") was a suite of programs for acquiring, editing, and distributing digital video and audio that was released during the same timeframe as Adobe Creative Suite 2. The suite was available in standard and premium editions. The Adobe Production Studio Premium edition consisted of: The Standard edition consisted of: Since CS3, Adobe Production Studio became part of the Creative Suite family. The equivalent version for Production Studio Premium is the ""Adobe Creative Suite Production Premium"". Macromedia Studio. Macromedia Studio was a suite of programs designed for web content creation designed and distributed by Macromedia. After Adobe's 2005 acquisition of Macromedia, Macromedia Studio 8 was replaced, modified, and integrated into two editions of the Adobe Creative Suite family of software from version 2.3 onwards. The closest relatives of Macromedia Studio 8 are now called ""Adobe Creative Suite Web Premium"". Core applications from Macromedia Studio have been merged with Adobe Creative Suite since CS3, including Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks. Some Macromedia applications were absorbed into existing Adobe products, e.g. FreeHand has been replaced with Adobe Illustrator. Director and ColdFusion are not part of Adobe Creative Suite and will only be available as standalone products. The final version of Macromedia Studio released include: Creative Suite 3. Adobe Creative Suite 3 (CS3) was announced on March 27, 2007; it introduced universal binaries for all major programs for the Apple Macintosh, as well as including all of the core applications from Macromedia Studio and Production Studio. Some Creative Suite programs also began using the Presto layout engine used in the Opera web browser. Adobe began selling CS3 applications in six different combinations called ""editions."" Design Standard & Premium and Web Standard & Premium began shipping on April 16, 2007, and Production Premium and Master Collection editions began shipping on July 2, 2007. The latest released CS3 version was version 3.3, released on June 2, 2008. In this version Fireworks CS3 was included in Design Premium and all editions that had included Acrobat 8 Pro had it replaced with Acrobat 9 Pro. Below is a matrix of the applications included in each edition of CS3 version 3.3: All of the above editions included shared applications and services including Adobe Bridge, Adobe Version Cue (except Production Premium), Adobe Device Central, Adobe Acrobat Connect and Adobe Stock Photos. Adobe Dynamic Link, Adobe OnLocation (Windows only) and Adobe Ultra (Windows only) were included in Production Premium and Master Collection editions. CS3 included several programs, including Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks that were developed by Macromedia, a former rival acquired by Adobe in 2005. It also included Adobe OnLocation and Adobe Ultra that were developed by Serious Magic, also a firm acquired by Adobe in 2006. Adobe dropped the following programs (that were previously included in CS2) from the CS3 software bundles: Adobe had announced that it would continue to develop Audition as a standalone product, while GoLive had been discontinued. Adobe GoLive 9 was released as a standalone product on June 10, 2007. Adobe Audition 3 was announced as a standalone product on September 6, 2007. Adobe had discontinued ImageReady and had replaced it with Fireworks, with some of ImageReady's features integrated into Photoshop. Creative Suite 4. Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) was announced on September 23, 2008 and officially released on October 15, 2008. All applications in CS4 featured the same user interface, with a new tabbed interface for working with concurrently running Adobe CS4 programs where multiple documents can be opened inside multiple tabs contained in a single window. Adobe CS4 was also developed to perform better under 64-bit and multi-core processors. On Windows, Adobe Photoshop CS4 ran natively as a 64-bit application. Although they were not natively 64-bit applications, Adobe After Effects CS4 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 had been optimized for 64-bit computers. However, there were no 64-bit versions of CS4 available for Mac OS X. In early testing of 64-bit support in Adobe Photoshop CS4, overall performance gains ranged from 8% to 12%, due to the fact that 64-bit applications could address larger amounts of memory and thus resulted in less file swapping — one of the biggest factors that can affect data processing speed. Two programs were dropped from the CS4 line-up: Adobe Ultra, a vector keying application which utilizes image analysis technology to produce high quality chroma key effects in less than ideal lighting environments and provides keying of a subject into a virtual 3D environment through virtual set technology, and Adobe Stock Photos. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS4: Creative Suite 5. Adobe Creative Suite 5 (CS5) was released on April 30, 2010. From CS5.5 onwards, Windows versions of Adobe Premiere CS5.5 and Adobe After Effects CS5.5 were 64-bit only and required at least Windows Vista 64-bit or a later 64-bit Windows version. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was no longer supported. Adobe Version Cue, an application that enabled users to track and manipulate file metadata and automate the process of collaboratively reviewing documents among groups of people, and the ""Adobe Creative Suite Web Standard"" edition, previously available in CS4, were dropped from the CS5 line-up. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS5: Creative Suite 5.5. Following the release of CS5 in April 2010, Adobe changed its release strategy to an every other year release of major number installments. CS5.5 was presented on April 12, 2011, as an in-between program until CS6. The update helped developers optimize websites for a variety of tablets, smart phones, and other devices. At the same time, Adobe announced a subscription-based pay service as an alternative to full purchase. On July 1, 2011, Adobe Systems announced its Switcher Program, which will allow people who had purchased any version of Apple's Final Cut Pro (or Avid Media Composer) to receive a 50 percent discount on Creative Suite CS5.5 Production Premium or Premiere Pro CS5.5. Not all products were upgraded to CS5.5 in this release; applications that were upgraded to CS5.5 included Adobe InDesign, Adobe Flash Catalyst, Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Device Central. Adobe Audition also replaced Adobe Soundbooth in CS5.5, Adobe Story was first offered as an AIR-powered screenwriting and preproduction application, and Adobe Acrobat X Pro replaced Acrobat 9.3 Pro. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS5.5: Creative Suite 6. During an Adobe conference call on June 21, 2011, CEO Shantanu Narayen said that the April 2011 launch of CS5.5 was ""the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle"", adding, ""We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012."" On March 21, 2012, Adobe released a freely available beta version of Adobe Photoshop CS6. The final version of Adobe CS6 was launched on a release event April 23, 2012, and first shipped May 7. Adobe also launched a subscription-based offering named Adobe Creative Cloud where users are able to gain access to individual applications or the full Adobe Creative Suite 6 suite on a per-month basis, plus additional cloud storage spaces and services. Move to Creative Cloud subscription-only service. On May 5, 2013, during the opening keynote of its Adobe MAX conference, Adobe announced that it was retiring the ""Creative Suite"" branding in favor of ""Creative Cloud"", and making all future feature updates to its software (now appended with ""CC"" instead of ""CS"", i.e. Photoshop CC) available via the Creative Cloud subscription service rather than through the purchasing of perpetual licenses. Customers must pay a monthly subscription fee and if they stop paying, they will lose access to the software as well as to the work they saved in proprietary file format, which is not backward-compatible with the Creative Suite (Adobe admitted that this is a valid concern). They must have Internet connection to download the software and to use the 2GB of provided storage space (or the additionally purchased 20GB), and must validate the license monthly. Adobe's decision to make the subscription service the only sales route for its creative software was met with strong criticism (see Creative Cloud controversy). Several online articles began offering replacements of Photoshop, Illustrator, and other programs, with competing products such as CorelDRAW, PaintShop Pro, and Pixelmator directly offering alternatives. In addition to many of the products formerly part of the Creative Suite (one product, Fireworks, was announced as having reached the end of its development cycle), Creative Cloud also offers subscription-exclusive products such as Adobe Muse and the Adobe Edge family, web-based file and website hosting, Typekit fonts, and access to the Behance social media platform. The new CC versions of their applications, and the full launch of the updated Creative Cloud service, was announced for June 17, 2013. Adobe also announced that it would continue to offer bug fixes for the CS6 products so that they will continue to run on the next versions of Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X "
wikipedia-363736," Starve the beast  ""Starving the beast"" is a political strategy employed by American conservatives in order to limit government spending by cutting taxes in order to deprive the government of revenue in a deliberate effort to force the federal government to reduce spending. The short and medium term effect of the strategy has dramatically increased the United States public debt rather than reduce spending. The term ""the beast"" in this context refers to the United States Federal Government and the programs it funds, particularly social programs such as welfare, Social Security, and Medicare; and does not usually refer to spending on military, law enforcement or prisons. History. On July 14, 1978, economist Alan Greenspan gave testimony to the U.S. Finance Committee: ""Let us remember that the basic purpose of any tax cut program in today's environment is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenue available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending."" Before his election as President, then-candidate Ronald Reagan foreshadowed the strategy during the 1980 US Presidential debates, saying ""John Anderson tells us that first we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker."" The earliest use of the actual term ""starving the beast"" to refer to the political-fiscal strategy (as opposed to its conceptual premise) was in a ""Wall Street Journal"" article in 1985 where the reporter quoted an unnamed Reagan staffer. Since 2000. The tax cuts and deficit spending of former US President George W. Bush's administration were attempts to ""starve the beast."" Bush said in 2001 ""so we have the tax relief plan [...] that now provides a new kind—a fiscal straightjacket for Congress. And that's good for the taxpayers, and it's incredibly positive news if you're worried about a federal government that has been growing at a dramatic pace over the past eight years and it has been."" Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson's tax-cut plan, incorporating a flat tax, also deferred paying for the larger deficits it would create. It ""would most likely be funded by lower government spending on Social Security and Medicare benefits"" according to the ""Wall Street Journal"".[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119603890284403477.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Political activist Grover Norquist authored an oath, the so-called ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" that 279 Senators and Congressman have signed. The oath states the signatories will never vote to raise taxes on anyone under any circumstances. It is viewed by some of the unsigned as a stumbling block to mutual fiscal negotiations to benefit the country. Economic analysis. James M. Buchanan, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, helped develop the Fiscal Illusion hypothesis: ""It's obvious, borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost."" In their book ""Democracy in Deficit"" (1977), Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner suggest that the complicated nature of the U.S. tax system causes fiscal illusion and results in greater public expenditure than would be the case in an idealized system in which everyone is aware in detail of what their share of the costs of government is. Empirical evidence shows that Starve the Beast may be counterproductive, with lower taxes actually corresponding to higher spending. An October 2007 study by Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer of the National Bureau of Economic Research found: ""[...] no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed, findings suggest that tax cuts may actually increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases."" William Niskanen, chairman emeritus of the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized “starve the beast.” If deficits finance 20% of government spending, then citizens perceive government services as discounted. Services that are popular at 20% off the listed price would be less popular at full price. He hypothesized that higher revenues could constrain spending, and found strong statistical support for that conjecture based on data from 1981 to 2005. Another Cato researcher, Michael New, tested Niskanen’s model in different time periods and using a more restrictive definition of spending (non-defense discretionary spending) and arrived at a similar conclusion. Professor Leonard E. Burman of Syracuse University testified to a U.S. Senate committee in July 2010 that: ""My guess is that if President Bush had announced a new war surtax to pay for Iraq or an increase in the Medicare payroll tax rate to pay for the prescription drug benefit, both initiatives would have been less popular. Given that the prescription drug benefit only passed Congress by one vote after an extraordinary amount of arm-twisting, it seems unlikely that it would have passed at all if accompanied by a tax increase. Starve the beast doesn’t work."" Economist Paul Krugman summarized as: ""Rather than proposing unpopular spending cuts, Republicans would push through popular tax cuts, with the deliberate intention of worsening the government’s fiscal position. Spending cuts could then be sold as a necessity rather than a choice, the only way to eliminate an unsustainable budget deficit."" He wrote that the ""...beast is starving, as planned..."" and that ""Republicans insist that the deficit must be eliminated, but they’re not willing either to raise taxes or to support cuts in any major government programs. And they’re not willing to participate in serious bipartisan discussions, either, because that might force them to explain their plan—and there isn’t any plan, except to regain power."" Historian Bruce Bartlett, former domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan, has called Starve the Beast ""the most pernicious fiscal doctrine in history"", and blames it for the increase in US government debt since the 1980s. Political advocacy. Former U.S. vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin expressly advocates the policy: ""please , starve the beast, don't perpetuate the problem, don't fund the largesse, we need to cut taxes."" U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, states ""you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans."" Activist Grover Norquist is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, ""My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub."" ""Feed the Beast"". A related idea known as ""Feed the Beast"", refers to increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget only to make the government spend those inflows. Economists Stephen Moore and Richard Vedder have written in the ""Wall Street Journal"" that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. In an op-ed, they both stated that ""grand bargain so many in Washington yearn for— tax increases coupled with spending cuts— is a fool's errand"" since ""higher tax collections never resulted in less spending."" Their conclusions have been disputed by economist and writer Bruce Bartlett in ""The Fiscal Times"", who stated that tax increases in the early 1990s helped contribute to more austere budgets in the late 1990s. "
wikipedia-363762," Invariant theory  Invariant theory is a branch of abstract algebra dealing with actions of groups on algebraic varieties from the point of view of their effect on functions. Classically, the theory dealt with the question of explicit description of polynomial functions that do not change, or are ""invariant"", under the transformations from a given linear group.  Invariant theory of finite groups has intimate connections with Galois theory. One of the first major results was the main theorem on the symmetric functions that described the invariants of the symmetric group ""S""""n"" acting on the polynomial ring R[""x""1, …, ""x""""n""] by permutations of the variables. More generally, the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem characterizes finite groups whose algebra of invariants is a polynomial ring. Modern research in invariant theory of finite groups emphasizes ""effective"" results, such as explicit bounds on the degrees of the generators. The case of positive characteristic, ideologically close to modular representation theory, is an area of active study, with links to algebraic topology. Invariant theory of infinite groups is inextricably linked with the development of linear algebra, especially, the theories of quadratic forms and determinants. Another subject with strong mutual influence was projective geometry, where invariant theory was expected to play a major role in organizing the material. One of the highlights of this relationship is the symbolic method. Representation theory of semisimple Lie groups has its roots in invariant theory. David Hilbert's work on the question of the finite generation of the algebra of invariants (1890) resulted in the creation of a new mathematical discipline, abstract algebra. A later paper of Hilbert (1893) dealt with the same questions in more constructive and geometric ways, but remained virtually unknown until David Mumford brought these ideas back to life in the 1960s, in a considerably more general and modern form, in his geometric invariant theory. In large measure due to the influence of Mumford, the subject of invariant theory is presently seen to encompass the theory of actions of linear algebraic groups on affine and projective varieties. A distinct strand of invariant theory, going back to the classical constructive and combinatorial methods of the nineteenth century, has been developed by Gian-Carlo Rota and his school. A prominent example of this circle of ideas is given by the theory of standard monomials. The nineteenth-century origins. Classically, the term ""invariant theory"" refers to the study of invariant algebraic forms (equivalently, symmetric tensors) for the action of linear transformations. This was a major field of study in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Current theories relating to the symmetric group and symmetric functions, commutative algebra, moduli spaces and the representations of Lie groups are rooted in this area. In greater detail, given a finite-dimensional vector space ""V"" of dimension ""n"" we can consider the symmetric algebra ""S""(""S""""r""(""V"")) of the polynomials of degree ""r"" over ""V"", and the action on it of GL(""V""). It is actually more accurate to consider the relative invariants of GL(""V""), or representations of SL(""V""), if we are going to speak of ""invariants"": that is because a scalar multiple of the identity will act on a tensor of rank ""r"" in S(""V"") through the ""r""-th power 'weight' of the scalar. The point is then to define the subalgebra of invariants ""I""(""S""""r""(""V"")) for the action. We are, in classical language, looking at invariants of ""n""-ary ""r""-ics, where ""n"" is the dimension of ""V"". (This is not the same as finding invariants of GL(""V"") on S(""V""); this is an uninteresting problem as the only such invariants are constants.) The case that was most studied was invariants of binary forms where ""n"" = 2.  Other work included that of Felix Klein in computing the invariant rings of finite group actions on formula_1 (the binary polyhedral groups, classified by the ADE classification); these are the coordinate rings of du Val singularities. The work of David Hilbert, proving that ""I""(""V"") was finitely presented in many cases, almost put an end to classical invariant theory for several decades, though the classical epoch in the subject continued to the final publications of Alfred Young, more than 50 years later. Explicit calculations for particular purposes have been known in modern times (for example Shioda, with the binary octavics). Hilbert's theorems. Hilbert constructed the Reynolds operator explicitly using Cayley's omega process Ω, though now it is more common to construct ρ indirectly as follows: for compact groups ""G"", the Reynolds operator is given by taking the average over ""G"", and non-compact reductive groups can be reduced to the case of compact groups using Weyl's unitarian trick. Given the Reynolds operator, Hilbert's theorem is proved as follows. The ring ""R"" is a polynomial ring so is graded by degrees, and the ideal ""I"" is defined to be the ideal generated by the homogeneous invariants of positive degrees. By Hilbert's basis theorem the ideal ""I"" is finitely generated (as an ideal). Hence, ""I"" is finitely generated ""by finitely many invariants of G"" (because if we are given any – possibly infinite – subset ""S"" that generates a finitely generated ideal ""I"", then ""I"" is already generated by some finite subset of ""S""). Let ""i""1...,""i""""n"" be a finite set of invariants of ""G"" generating ""I"" (as an ideal). The key idea is to show that these generate the ring ""R""""G"" of invariants. Suppose that ""x"" is some homogeneous invariant of degree ""d"" > 0. Then for some ""a""""j"" in the ring ""R"" because ""x"" is in the ideal ""I"". We can assume that ""a""""j"" is homogeneous of degree ""d"" − deg ""i""""j"" for every ""j"" (otherwise, we replace ""a""""j"" by its homogeneous component of degree ""d"" − deg ""i""""j""; if we do this for every ""j"", the equation ""x"" = ""a""1""i""1 + ... + ""a""""n""""i""n will remain valid). Now, applying the Reynolds operator to ""x"" = ""a""1""i""1 + ... + ""a""""n""""i""n gives We are now going to show that ""x"" lies in the ""R""-algebra generated by ""i""1...,""i""""n"". First, let us do this in the case when the elements ρ(""a""""k"") all have degree less than ""d"". In this case, they are all in the ""R""-algebra generated by ""i""1...,""i""""n"" (by our induction assumption). Therefore ""x"" is also in this ""R""-algebra (since ""x"" = ""ρ""(""a""1)""i""1 + ... + ρ(""a""n)""i""n). In the general case, we cannot be sure that the elements ρ(""a""""k"") all have degree less than ""d"". But we can replace each ρ(""a""""k"") by its homogeneous component of degree ""d"" − deg ""i""""j"". As a result, these modified ρ(""a""""k"") are still ""G""-invariants (because every homogeneous component of a ""G""-invariant is a ""G""-invariant) and have degree less than ""d"" (since deg ""i""""k"" > 0). The equation ""x"" = ρ(""a""1)""i""1 + ... + ρ(""a""n)""i""n still holds for our modified ρ(""a""""k""), so we can again conclude that ""x"" lies in the ""R""-algebra generated by ""i""1...,""i""""n"". Hence, by induction on the degree, all elements of ""R""""G"" are in the ""R""-algebra generated by ""i""1...,""i""""n"". Geometric invariant theory. The modern formulation of geometric invariant theory is due to David Mumford, and emphasizes the construction of a quotient by the group action that should capture invariant information through its coordinate ring. It is a subtle theory, in that success is obtained by excluding some 'bad' orbits and identifying others with 'good' orbits.

wikipedia-363764," The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy  The French Revolution was a period in the history of France covering the years 1789 to 1799, in which republicans overthrew the Bourbon monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church in France perforce underwent radical restructuring. This article covers the one-year period from 1 October 1791 to September 1792, during which France was governed by the Legislative Assembly, operating under the French Constitution of 1791, between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention. The composition of the Legislative Assembly. The National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 1 October 1791. Upon Robespierre's motion it had decreed that none of its members should be capable of sitting in the next legislature, this is known as the Self-Denying Ordinance. Its legacy, the Constitution of 1791, attempted to institute a liberal constitutional monarchy. This had been envisioned as an arrangement not to be tampered with for a generation but, in the event, it did not last a year.  In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. In the words of the 1911 ""Encyclopædia Britannica"", ""It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot."" In the elections of 1791, despite a limited electoral franchise, the party which desired to carry the Revolution further had a success disproportionate to its numbers, a triumph for the Jacobin Club and by its affiliated societies throughout France.  The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791. It consisted of 745 members. Few were nobles, very few were clergymen, and the great body came from the middle class. The members were generally young, and, since none had sat in the previous Assembly, they largely lacked national political experience.  The Right consisted of about 165 ""Feuillants"". Among them were some able men, such as Mathieu Dumas, Ramond, Vaublanc, Beugnot and Bigot de Préamenau, but they were guided chiefly by persons outside the House, because incapable of re-election: Barnave, Adrien Duport, and the brothers Alexander and Charles Lameth. The Left consisted of about 330 Jacobins, a term which still included the now-emergent party afterwards known as the Girondins or Girondists – so termed because several of their leaders came from the region of the Gironde in southern France. Among the extreme Left—those who would retain the name of Jacobins—sat Cambon, Couthon, Antoine-Christophe Merlin (""Merlin de Thionville""), François Chabot, and Claude Bazire. The Girondins could claim the most brilliant orators: Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud, Marguerite-Élie Guadet, Armand Gensonné, and Maximin Isnard (the last being from Provence). Jacques Pierre Brissot (""Brissot de Warville""), a restless pamphleteer and editor of the newspaper ""Patriote"", was described by the 1911 ""Encyclopædia Britannica"" as ""inferior to these men in talent"", but exerted such great influence over the party that it has sometimes gone by his name (""Brissotins""). Also aligned with the Girondins were Condorcet, secretary of the Assembly and Pétion, barred from the Legislative Assembly because he had been in the Constitutional Assembly, but who soon became mayor of Paris. This strong representation of the left in the Assembly was supplemented by the political clubs and the disorderly revolutionary elements in Paris and throughout France.  The remainder of the Assembly, about 350 deputies (Matthews 2004), did not belong to any definite party, but voted most often with the Left. The king's ministers. The king's ministers, named by him and excluded from the Assembly, were mostly persons of little mark. Montmorin gave up the portfolio of foreign affairs on 31 October 1791 and was succeeded by De Lessart, the previous minister of finance. Bon-Claude Cahier de Gerville was minister of the interior; Louis Hardouin Tarbé, minister of finance; and Bertrand de Molleville, minister of marine. But the only minister who influenced the course of affairs was the comte de Narbonne, minister of war. Overtly, the king (despite his earlier attempt to escape Paris during the flight to Varennes) had embraced the newly codified constitution. It seems unlikely that he could actually have liked losing his previous absolute power, but he may well have been sincerely trying to make the best of what, from his point of view, was a bad situation. Marie Antoinette surely wished to shake off the impotence and humiliation of the Crown, and for this end she still clung to the hope of foreign succour and corresponded with Vienna. The politics of the Left. The Left had three objects of enmity. First among these was the royal couple, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and the royal family.  The Left as a whole wished to replace the monarchy with a republic, although this was not initially the public position of most of them. Second came the ""émigrés"" – now seen as a threat from abroad—and, third, the non-juring clergy. Those ""émigrés"" who had assembled in arms on the territories of the electors of Mainz and Treves (Trier) and in the Austrian Netherlands had put themselves in the position of public enemies. Their chiefs were the king's brothers, who affected to consider Louis as a captive and his acts as therefore invalid. The count of Provence gave himself the airs of a regent and surrounded himself with a ministry. The 1911 ""Encyclopædia Britannica"" writes that the only actual danger posed by the ""émigrés"" was symbolic: that they were only a few thousand strong; that they had no competent leader and no money; and that although they had earlier been of some diplomatic significance, they were increasingly unwelcome to the rulers whose hospitality they abused. However, Mignet claims that the threat was more substantive and their numbers growing and that ""the ambassadors of the emigrants were received, while those of the French government were dismissed, ill received, or even thrown into prison, as in the case of M. Duveryer."" The non-juring clergy – those who refused to take an oath under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy – although harassed by the local authorities, kept the respect and confidence of most Catholics. The 1911 ""Encyclopædia Britannica"" reports that ""No acts of disloyalty were proved against them, and commissioners of the National Assembly reported to its successor that their flocks only desired to be let alone. But the anti-clerical bias of the Legislative Assembly was too strong for such a policy."" Mignet, however, quotes the marquis de Ferrières, ""Priests, and especially bishops employed all the resources of fanaticism to excite the people, in town and country, against the civil constitution of the clergy"", and points out that Bishops ordered the priests no longer to perform divine service in the same church with the constitutional priests. It was increasingly unlikely that two rival Churches could co-exist. Insurrection along religious lines broke out in Calvados, Gévaudan, and the Vendée (""see Revolt in the Vendée)"". The king exercises his veto. From the first, relations between the king and the Legislative Assembly were less than friendly. The king refused to meet the Assembly's initial delegation in person; the Assembly voted to deprive the ceremony of the king's visit to their hall of almost all customary pomp (although the vote was rescinded the following day, and the king's address was generally well received).  On 9 November 1791 the Assembly decreed that the ""émigrés"" assembled on the frontiers should be liable to the penalties of death and confiscation if they remained so assembled on 1 January following. (The legislation was clearly directed against those who had taken up arms or engaged in diplomacy: it was reasonably indulgent towards those who simply felt safer abroad.) Louis did not love his brothers, and he detested their policy, which without rendering him any service made his liberty and even his life precarious; yet, loath to condemn them to death, he vetoed the decree. He did, however, sign a decree of 30 October, stating that his eldest brother Louis-Stanislaus-Xavier was required to return to France in two months, or at the expiration of that period he would be considered to have forfeited his rights as regent. On 29 November 1791 the Assembly decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath, substantially the same as the oath previously administered, on pain of losing his pension and, if any troubles broke out, of being deported. This decree Louis vetoed as a matter of conscience. In either case his resistance only served to give a weapon to his enemies in the Assembly. But foreign affairs were at this time the most critical. A new administration in Paris. Following the same policy under which the members of the Constituent Assembly had barred themselves from the Legislative Assembly, in October, Lafayette resigned the command of the National Guard, and Bailly retired from the mayoralty of Paris. Most of those who wished to continue a constitutional monarchy (against the increasingly republican legislature) wished Lafayette to succeed Bailly as mayor. However, afraid of Lafayette as a rival to the king, the court actually favored and assisted the Girondist Pétion in the election. In the election of 4 November, Pétion received 9,708 votes in a total of 10,632 and became the new mayor. War approaches. The armed bodies of ""émigrés"" on the territory of the Holy Roman Empire afforded matter of complaint to France. The persistence of the French in offering only money as compensation to the German princes who had claims in Alsace afforded matter of complaint to the Empire. Foreign statesmen noticed with alarm the effect of the French Revolution upon opinion in their own countries, and they resented the endeavours of French revolutionaries to make converts there.  Of these statesmen, the emperor Leopold II was the most intelligent. He had skillfully extricated himself from the embarrassments at home and abroad left by his predecessor Joseph II. He had family ties to Louis XVI, and he was obliged, as chief of the Holy Roman Empire, to protect the border princes. On the other hand, he understood the weakness of the Habsburg monarchy. He knew that the Austrian Netherlands, where he had with difficulty restored his authority, were full of friends of the Revolution and that a French army would be welcomed by many Belgians. He despised the weakness and the folly of the ""émigrés"" and excluded them from his councils. He earnestly desired to avoid a war which might endanger his sister Marie Antoinette or her husband.  In August 1791 Leopold had met Frederick William II of Prussia at Pillnitz Castle near Dresden, and the two monarchs had joined in stating in the Declaration of Pillnitz that they considered the restoration of order and of monarchy in France an object of interest to all sovereigns. They further declared that they would be ready to act for this purpose in concert with the other powers. The 1911 ""Encyclopædia Britannica"" argues that this declaration appears to have been drawn from Leopold by pressure of circumstances. He well knew that concerted action of the powers was impossible, as Great Britain had firmly resolved not to meddle with French affairs. After Louis had accepted the constitution, Leopold virtually withdrew his declaration. Nevertheless it remained a grave error of judgment and contributed to the approaching war. In France many persons desired war for various reasons. Narbonne trusted to find in it the means of restoring a certain authority to the crown and of limiting the Revolution. He contemplated a war with Austria only. The Girondins desired war in the hope that it would enable them to abolish monarchy altogether. They desired a general war because they believed that it would carry the Revolution into other countries and make it secure in France by making it universal. The extreme Left had the same objects, but it held that a war for those objects could not safely be entrusted to the king and his ministers. Victory would revive the power of the crown; defeat would be the undoing of the Revolution. Robespierre also argued against the Girondins' objective of using war as a means of exporting revolution, on the grounds that ""nobody likes armed missionaries"".  Hence Robespierre and those who thought with him desired peace. The French nation generally had never approved of the Austrian alliance, and regarded the Habsburgs as traditional enemies. The views of the king and queen on the matter continue to be a matter of controversy. Some historians argue that they dreaded a war with Austria; others that they wanted war because they thought France would lose and the Austrians and the other invaders would then restore the absolute monarchy.  France was in no condition to wage a serious war. The constitution was unworkable and the governing authorities were mutually hostile. The finances remained in disorder, with inflation rampant: ""assignats"" of the face value of 900,000,000 ""livres"" were issued by the Legislative Assembly in less than a year. The army had been thinned by desertion and was enervated by long ill-discipline. The fortresses were in bad condition and short of supplies. In October Leopold ordered the dispersion of the ""émigrés"" who had mustered in arms in the Austrian Netherlands. His example was followed by the electors of Treves and Mainz. At the same time they implored the emperor's protection, and the Austrian chancellor Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz informed Noailles, the French ambassador that this protection would be given if necessary. Narbonne demanded a credit of 20,000,000 livres, which the Assembly granted. He made a tour of inspection in the north of France and reported untruly to the Assembly that all was in readiness for war. On 14 January 1792 the diplomatic committee reported to the Assembly that the emperor should be required to give satisfactory assurances before 10 February. The Assembly put off the term to 1 March.  In February Leopold concluded a defensive treaty with Frederick William II. But there was no mutual confidence between the sovereigns, who were at that very time pursuing opposite policies with regard to Poland. Leopold still hesitated and still hoped to avoid war. He died on 1 March 1792, and the imperial dignity became vacant. The hereditary dominions of Austria passed to his son Francis, afterwards the emperor Francis II, a youth of small abilities and no experience. The real conduct of affairs fell, therefore, to the aged Kaunitz.  In France Narbonne failed to carry the king or his colleagues along with him. The king took courage to dismiss him on 9 March 1792, whereupon the Legislative Assembly testified its confidence in Narbonne. De Lessart having incurred its anger by the tameness of his replies to Austrian dictation, the Assembly voted his impeachment. The Girondin ministry. The king, seeing no other course open, formed a new ministry which was chiefly Girondin. Jean-Marie Roland became minister of the interior, Étienne Clavière of finance, Pierre Marie de Grave of war, and Jean de Lacoste of marine. Far abler and more resolute than any of these men was Charles François Dumouriez, the new minister for foreign affairs. A soldier by profession, he had been employed in the secret diplomacy of Louis XV and had thus gained a wide knowledge of international politics. He stood aloof from parties and had no rigid principles, but held views closely resembling those of Narbonne. He wished for a war with Austria which should restore some influence to the crown and make himself the arbiter of France. It is difficult today to imagine how different these men were from the previous ministers. According to Mignet, the court named this ministry """"le Ministère Sans-Culotte"""", and the first time Roland appeared at court—with laces rather than buckles on his shoes—the master of the ceremonies initially refused to admit him. The king bent to necessity, and on 20 April 1792 came to the Assembly with the proposal that war should be declared against Austria. It was carried by acclamation. Dumouriez intended to begin with an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands. As this would awaken English jealousy, he sent Talleyrand to London with assurances that, if victorious, the French would annex no territory. The initial disasters of war. The French war plan envisaged invading the Netherlands at three points simultaneously. Lafayette would march against Namur, Biron against Mons, and Dillon against Tournai. But the first movement disclosed the miserable state of the army. Smitten with panic, Dillon's force fled at sight of the enemy, and Dillon, after receiving a wound from one of his own soldiers, was murdered by the mob of Lille. Biron was easily routed before Mons. On hearing of these disasters Lafayette found it necessary to retreat.  This shameful discomfiture quickened all the suspicion and jealousy fermenting in France. De Grave had to resign and was succeeded by Servan. The Austrian forces in the Netherlands were, however, so weak that they could not take the offensive. Austria demanded help from Prussia under the terms of their recent alliance, and the claim was admitted. Prussia declared war against France, and the Duke of Brunswick was chosen to command the allied forces, but various causes delayed action. Austrian and Prussian interests clashed in Poland. The Austrian government wished to preserve a harmless neighbour. The Prussian government desired another Polish partition and a large tract of Polish territory. Only after long discussion was it agreed that Prussia should be free to act in Poland, while Austria might find compensation in provinces conquered from France. The respite thus given allowed France to improve the army. Meantime the Legislative Assembly passed three decrees: one for the deportation of non-juring priests, another to suppress the king's Constitutional Guard, and a third for the establishment of a camp of ""fédérés"" near Paris. Louis consented to sacrifice his guard, but vetoed the other decrees. Roland having addressed to him an arrogant letter of remonstrance (mainly about the matter of the non-juring priests), the king with the support of Dumouriez dismissed Roland, Servan and Clavière. Dumouriez then took the ministry of war, and the other places were filled with such men as could be had, mainly members of the already collapsing Feuillant faction. Dumouriez, who cared only for the successful prosecution of the war, urged the king to accept the decrees. As Louis was obstinate, Dumouriez felt that he could do no more. Dumouriez resigned office on 15 June 1792 and went to join the army of the north.  Lafayette, who remained faithful to the constitution of 1791, ventured on a letter of remonstrance to the Assembly. It paid no attention, for Lafayette could no longer sway the people. Furthermore, coming as it did from a young general at the head of his army, the letter suggested to many ambition on Lafayette's part. The left now suspected Lafayette of precisely the type of ambition of which he had already been suspected by the court. Protests of 20 June. The Jacobins tried to frighten the king into accepting the decrees and recalling his ministers. On 20 June 1792 the armed populace invaded the hall of the Assembly and the royal apartments in the Tuileries. For some hours the king and queen were in the utmost peril. With passive courage Louis refrained from making any promise to the insurgents. The failure of the insurrection encouraged a movement in favour of the king. Some twenty thousand Parisians signed a petition expressing sympathy with Louis. Addresses of like tenor poured in from the departments and the provincial cities. Lafayette himself came to Paris in the hope of rallying the constitutional party, but the king and queen eluded his offers of assistance. They had always disliked and distrusted Lafayette and the Feuillants, and now preferred to rest their hopes of deliverance on the foreigners. Lafayette returned to his troops without having effected anything.  The Girondins made a last advance to Louis, offering to save the monarchy if he would accept them as ministers. His refusal united all the Jacobins in the project of overturning the monarchy by force. The Journée of 10 August. The ruling spirit of this new revolution was Danton, a barrister only thirty-two years old, who had not sat in either Assembly, although he had been the leader of the Cordeliers, an advanced republican club, and had a strong hold on the common people of Paris. Danton and his friends were assisted in their work by the fear of invasion, for the allied army was at length mustering on the frontier. The Assembly declared the country in danger. All the regular troops in or near Paris were sent to the front. Volunteers and ""fédérés"" were constantly arriving in Paris, and, although most went on to join the army, the Jacobins enlisted those who were suitable for their purpose, especially some 500 whom Barbaroux, a Girondin, had summoned from Marseille. At the same time the National Guard – up to now middle-class in character—was opened to those from the lower classes. Brunswick's famous declaration of 25 July 1792, announcing that the allies would enter France to restore the royal authority and would visit the Assembly and the city of Paris with military execution if any further outrage were offered to the king, heated the republican spirit to fury. It was resolved to strike the decisive blow on 10 August. On the night of 9 August a new revolutionary Paris Commune took possession of the ""Hôtel de Ville"", and early on the morning of 10 August the insurgents assailed the Tuileries. As the preparations of the Jacobins had been notorious, some measures of defence had been taken. Besides a few gentlemen in arms and a number of National Guards, the palace was garrisoned by the Swiss Guard, about 950 strong. The disparity of force was not so great as to make resistance altogether hopeless. But Louis let himself be persuaded into betraying his own cause and retiring with his family under the shelter of the Assembly. The National Guards either dispersed or fraternised with the assailants. The Swiss Guard stood firm, and, possibly by accident, a fusillade began. The enemy were gaining ground when the Swiss received an order from the king to cease firing and withdraw. They were mostly shot down as they were retiring, and of those who surrendered about 60 were massacred by the mob as they were being taken under escort to the Hotel de Ville. Insurrection and constitutional crisis. The king and queen spent long hours in a reporter's box while the Legislative Assembly discussed their fate and the fate of the French monarchy. Little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. They decreed that Louis should be suspended from his office and that a convention should be summoned to give France a new constitution. An executive council was formed by recalling Roland, Clavière and Servan to office and joining with them Danton as minister of justice, Lebrun as minister of foreign affairs, and Monge as minister of marine. When Lafayette heard of the insurrection in Paris he tried to rally his troops in defence of the constitution, but they refused to follow him. He was driven to cross the frontier and surrender himself to the Austrians. Dumouriez was named his successor.  But the new government was still beset with danger. It had no root in law and little hold on public opinion. It could not lean on the Assembly, a mere shrunken remnant, whose days were numbered. It remained dependent on the power which had set it up, the revolutionary Commune of Paris. The Commune could therefore extort what concessions it pleased. It got the custody of the king and his family, who were imprisoned in the Temple. Having obtained an indefinite power of arrest, it soon filled the prisons of Paris.  As the elections to the Convention were close at hand, the Commune resolved to strike the public with terror by the slaughter of its prisoners. It found its opportunity in the progress of invasion. On 19 August 1792 Brunswick crossed the frontier. On 22 August Longwy surrendered. Verdun was invested and seemed likely to fall. On 1 September the Commune declared a state of emergency by decreeing that on the following day the tocsin should be rung, all able-bodied citizens convened in the Champ de Mars, and 60,000 volunteers enrolled for the defence of the country.  While this assembly was in progress teams of executioners were sent to the prisons and began a butchery which lasted four days and consumed 1400 victims. The Commune addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example. A number of state prisoners awaiting trial at Orléans were ordered to Paris and on the way were slaughtered at Versailles. The Assembly offered a feeble resistance to these actions. Danton can hardly be acquitted of connivance at them. Roland hinted disapproval, but did not venture more. He with many other Girondins had been marked for slaughter in the original project. The elections to the Convention were by almost universal suffrage, but indifference or intimidation reduced the voters to a small number. Many who had sat in the National Constituent Assembly and many more who had sat in the Legislative Assembly were returned. The Convention met on 20 September and became the new ""de facto"" government of France. "
wikipedia-363770," Monaural  Monaural or monophonic sound reproduction (often shortened to mono) is single-channel. Typically there is only one microphone, one loudspeaker, or (in the case of headphones and multiple loudspeakers) channels are fed from a common signal path. In the case of multiple microphones the paths are mixed into a single signal path at some stage. Monaural sound has been replaced by stereo sound in most entertainment applications. However, it remains the standard for radiotelephone communications, telephone networks, and audio induction loops for use with hearing aids. A few FM radio stations, particularly talk radio shows, choose to broadcast in monaural, as a monaural signal has a slight advantage in signal strength over a stereophonic signal of the same power. History. While some experiments were made with stereophonic recording and reproduction from the early days of the phonograph in the late-19th century, until the second half of the 20th century, monaural was the rule for almost all audio recording. Monaural sound is normal on: Incompatible standards exist for: Compatible monaural and stereophonic standards exist for: No native monaural standards exist for: In those formats, the mono-source material is presented as two identical channels, thus being technically stereo. At various times artists have preferred to work in mono, either in recognition of the technical limitations of the equipment of the era or due to a simple preference. This can be seen as analogous to filmmakers working in black and white—such as John Mellencamp's 2010 album, ""No Better Than This"", recorded in mono just like the mid-20th century blues and folk records it emulated were. Some early recordings such as The Beatles first four albums - ""Please Please Me"", ""With The Beatles"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", and ""Beatles For Sale"" - were re-released in the CD era as monophonic in recognition that the source tapes for the earliest recordings were two track, with vocals on one track and instruments on the other (even though this was only true on the first two, while the later pair had been recorded on four-track). This was actually intended to provide flexibility in producing a final mono mix, not to provide a stereo recording, although due to demand this was done anyway and the early material was available on vinyl in either mono or stereo formats. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was common in the pop world that stereophonic versions of mono tracks were generated electronically using filtering techniques to attempt to pick out various instruments and vocals, but these were often considered unsatisfactory due to the artifacts of the conversion process. Many of Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allen's movies were recorded in mono due to their director's preferences. Monaural LP records were eventually phased out and no longer manufactured after the early 1970s, with a few exceptions. For example, Decca UK had a few double issues until the end of 1970—the last one being Tom Jones' ""I Who Have Nothing""; in Brazil records were released in both mono and stereo as late as 1972. During the 1960s it was common that albums were released as both monaural LPs and stereo LPs, occasionally with slight differences between the two (again detailed information of The Beatles' recordings provide a good example of the differences). This was because many people owned mono record players which were incapable of playing stereo records, as well as the prevalence of AM radio. Because of the limited quantities pressed and alternate mixes of several tracks, the monaural versions of these albums are often valued more highly than their stereo LP counterparts in record collecting circles today. On 9 September 2009, The Beatles re-released a remastered box set of their mono output spanning the ""Please Please Me"" album to ""The Beatles"" (commonly referred to as the ""The White Album""). The set, simply called ""The Beatles in Mono"", also includes a two-disc summary of the mono singles, B-sides and EP tracks released throughout their career. Also included were five previously unreleased tracks originally mixed for a ""Yellow Submarine EP"". Bob Dylan followed suit on October 19, 2010 with ""The Original Mono Recordings"", a box set featuring the mono releases from ""Bob Dylan"" (1962) to ""John Wesley Harding"" (1967). In 2011, The Kinks' mono recordings were issued as ""The Kinks in Mono"" box set, featuring the releases of the band's albums from ""Kinks"" (1964) to ""Arthur"" (1969), with three additional CDs of non-album tracks that appeared on singles and EPs. Merged stereo. Sometimes ""mono sound"" or ""monaural"" can simply refer to a merged path of stereo channels. Over time some devices have used mono sound amplification circuitry with stereo sound compatibility since it can cut the cost of the hardware. Some consumer electronics with stereo RCA outputs have a microswitch in the red (right stereo channel) RCA output which disables merging of stereo sound into the white (left stereo channel) RCA output. Common devices with this are VCRs, DVD/Blu-ray players, information appliances, set-top boxes, etc., though video game consoles have male RCA ends of cables with a proprietary multi A/V plug on the other end, where automatic stereo merging isn't possible, unless adapers are used. Disadvantages to merged stereo involve muffling mirror-image stereo channels that are otherwise identical to the human ear. Electrically and mechanically, it places more stress on a loudspeaker since having an array of loudspeaker can mitigate issues with electrical load for a single loudspeaker coil. In video games, merging stereo to mono sound prevents player from discerning what direction distant SFX are coming from, though reverse stereo has a similar setback too. Mirrored mono. Mirrored mono sound is the opposite of merged stereo, since it can be a case where media with mono sound that stereo playback devices automatically mirror it with are played on both channels of the receiver. It can also mean having a mono input mixed down to stereo amplification circuitry, or a mono system with a headphone output compatible with stereo headphones. And example of an application where both merged stereo and mirror mono apply is when a compact audio cassette respectively plays back ""summed"" stereo channels on a mono reading head, and when a compact cassette recorded with mono sound is played back with a stereo tape head.

wikipedia-363776," Maria Bueno  Maria Esther Andion Bueno (born 11 October 1939) is a former professional tennis player from Brazil. During her 11-year career (plus a two-year comeback in 1976–77), she won 19 Major titles (seven singles, 11 women's doubles, one mixed doubles). She was the year-end number-one ranked female player four times. In 1960, Bueno became the first woman ever to win all four Grand Slam double titles in one year (three with Darlene Hard and one with Christine Truman Janes). Career. Bueno began playing tennis at a very young age and, without having received any formal training, won her first tournament at age 12. She was 14 when she captured her country's women's singles championship. Joining the international circuit in 1958, Bueno won the singles title at the Italian Championships and the first of her Grand Slam titles, capturing the women's doubles at Wimbledon with Althea Gibson. The following year, Bueno won her first singles title at Wimbledon, defeating Darlene Hard in the final. She also won the singles title at the U.S. Championships, earning the World No. 1 ranking for 1959 and the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year award. Bueno was the first non-North-American woman to capture both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships in the same calendar year. In her native Brazil, she returned as a national heroine, honored by the country's president and given a ticker-tape parade on the streets of São Paulo. According to Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail and Bud Collins, Bueno was ranked in the world top ten from 1958 through 1960 and from 1962 through 1968, reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings in 1959 and 1960. The International Tennis Hall of Fame also lists her as the top ranked player in 1964 (after losing the final at the French Championships and winning both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships) and 1966. Bueno won the singles title at Wimbledon three times and at the U.S. Championships four times. She was a singles finalist at the Australian Championships and the French Championships, losing both finals to Margaret Court. Bueno reached at least the quarterfinals in each of the first 26 Grand Slam singles tournaments she played. This streak ended at Wimbledon in 1967 when she lost in the fourth round because of an arm injury. As a doubles player, Bueno won twelve Grand Slam championships with six different partners. In 1960, she became the first woman to win the women's doubles title at all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year, partnered by Christine Truman Janes at the Australian Championships and Hard at the French Championships, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Championships. In 1978, Bueno was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. At the 2006 US Open, Maria Bueno was invited to attend the rededication ceremony of the USTA National Tennis Center as the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which took place on the first day of the event. Bueno and King were rivals in singles and, on occasion, doubles partners. According to Bueno, the only players invited were those who had won the US Open ""more than twice"" (she won it four times). At the same event, Bueno debuted as a commentator for SporTV, a Brazilian cable television sports channel. She commentated on the women's singles semifinals and final and the men's singles final. She also offered opinions during the live broadcast of the USTA's induction of Martina Navrátilová and Don Budge in the ""Court of Champions"", as well as during day-end ""round tables"" in the last three days of the event. Grand Slam finals: 35 (19 titles, 16 runners-up). Bueno won 19 and lost 16 of her Grand Slam finals. This represents a success rate of 54%. Grand Slam singles tournament timeline.

Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are apostles, with the calling to be prophets, seers, and revelators, evangelical ambassadors, and special witnesses of Jesus Christ. The quorum was first organized in 1835 and designated as a body of ""traveling councilors"" with jurisdiction outside areas where the church was formally organized, equal in authority to the First Presidency as well as to the Seventy, the standing Presiding High Council, and the High Councils of the various stakes (Doctrine & Covenants 107:25-27, 36-37). The jurisdiction of the Twelve was originally limited to areas of the world outside of Zion or its stakes. After the Apostles returned from England, Joseph Smith altered the responsibilities of the quorum. They were given charge of the affairs of the church, under direction of the First Presidency. Role of the quorum in the LDS Church. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles claims a leadership role second only to that of the First Presidency. After the death of Joseph Smith, Jr., the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was Brigham Young. Young emphasized what he said was Joseph Smith's authorization that the Quorum of the Twelve should be the church's central governing body of the church after Smith's death. Then in 1847, the Twelve reorganized the First Presidency with Young as President, and the Twelve took on a supporting role within a chain of command under the First Presidency, a role that continues to the present. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the LDS Church has some general similarities to the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, primarily in its duty to choose a successor upon the death of a church president, However, the whole body of LDS general authorities has also been viewed as instead being closer to those of the cardinals. and each has a ""strict verticality of its administration"". There are differences, due in part to the President and the Twelve having life tenure, which may lead to an older or infirm President, but also provides considerable training of Apostles to take over the office of the Presidency; meaning ""the members of quorum are being groomed for the job during this time."" Church policy decisions are made unanimously, with consultation among the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and where appropriate, the Seventy, each of which has its own responsibility. A great deal of effort is made to ensure that the organizations are united in purpose and policy. Each member of the quorum is accepted by the church as an apostle, as well as a ""prophet, seer, and revelator."" Thus, each apostle is considered to hold the rights (""keys of the Priesthood"") to use all powers granted by God to the church. Individually and collectively, the Twelve Apostles hold the keys and have conferred the authority to exercise all of the keys upon the President of the Church, the one man who is to preside over the church. Thus, as outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants, only the President of the Church is entitled to receive revelation or dictate policy for the entire church. A major role of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is to appoint a successor when the President of the Church dies. Shortly after this occurs, the apostles meet in a room of the Salt Lake Temple to appoint a successor. Invariably this has been the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with seniority determined by the longest continuous duration of service. The apostles lay their hands on his head and ordain him and set him apart as President of the Church. The president then chooses two counselors, who are high priests (usually apostles). The second most senior surviving apostle becomes the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In cases when the President of the Quorum is simultaneously called to be a counselor in the First Presidency, or is unable to serve due to health considerations, an acting president of the quorum is called in his stead to fill the position. This has invariably been the most senior member of the quorum who is not a member of the First Presidency. As vacancies arise within the quorum, the Twelve and counselors in the First Presidency are invited to meet and counsel together in prayer in order to recommend names to the President of the Church as to whom will be called to fill the vacancy. The final decision rests with the President of the Church, but is sustained by the Twelve and the counselors in the First Presidency. The chosen man is generally ordained an apostle by the President of the Church, a counselor in the First Presidency, or the President of the Twelve. Depending on circumstances, this may occur before or after a sustaining vote is held at a general conference of the church, which is traditionally the occasion for the new apostle to be publicly announced and sustained by church members. Any faithful Melchizedek priesthood holder is eligible to be called as an apostle. Generally, new apostles have considerable experience in church government and have served faithfully in positions as bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, or seventies. As a matter of policy, apostles are generally asked to retire from their professional careers and devote themselves to full-time church service. Even members of boards and professional organizations are asked to resign those positions, although some of them receive assignments to become members of boards of church-owned for-profit corporations and trustees of the church's educational institutions. (Some exceptions have been made to this rule, as when quorum member Ezra Taft Benson was permitted to serve as United States Secretary of Agriculture from 1953 to 1961 and when quorum member Reed Smoot was permitted to serve in the United States Senate from 1903 to 1933.) The calling of an apostle is typically a lifetime calling. Current members. The current members of the quorum are as follows: "
wikipedia-363786," Stereopticon  A stereopticon is a slide projector or ""magic lantern"", which has two lenses, usually one above the other. These devices date back to the mid 19th century, and were a popular form of entertainment and education before the advent of moving pictures. Americans William and Frederick Langenheim introduced stereopticon slide technology—slide shows of projected photographs on glass—in 1850. For a fee of ten cents, people could view realistic photographs with nature, history, and science themes. At first, the shows used random images, but over time, lanternists began to place the slides in logical order, creating a narrative. This ""visual storytelling"" directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures. The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a stereoscope. A stereopticon will not project or display stereoscopic/three-dimensional images. The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. All stereopticons can be classified as magic lanterns, but not all magic lanterns are stereopticons. "
wikipedia-363792," Sunday Sport  Sunday Sport is a British tabloid newspaper, published by Sport Newspapers, which was established in 1986. It prints plainly ludicrous stories, such as a double-decker London bus being found frozen in the Antarctic ice, or a World War II bomber found on the moon. Defenders of the paper pointed out that it was not intended to be taken seriously . Its controversial content also includes a high quotient of softcore female nudity and extensive advertising for sexual services. Its original publisher was David Sullivan. Advertising in the ""Sunday Sport"" was once the responsibility of Sullivan's protegee Karren Brady, who went on to become managing director of Birmingham City Football Club and vice-chairman of West Ham United. Sullivan sold the paper to Sport Newspapers but had to give them a £1.68m bailout in 2009. The last editor was Nick Appleyard, appointed in September 2007. His predecessors included Michael Gabbert and Paul Carter. It had a sister daily title, ""Daily Sport"". It ceased publication and entered administration on 1 April 2011. However, it shortly returned to publication on 8 May after it was re-acquired by its original publisher David Sullivan for £50,000. Sullivan now publishes the paper three times a week as ""Midweek Sport"" (Wednesdays), ""Weekend Sport"" (Fridays) and ""Sunday Sport"", through his company Sunday Sport (2011) Limited. It always has a salacious edge, mirroring ""The Sun""'s page three, except spread across more of the pages. Following the departure of editor-in-chief Tony Livesey in August 2006, the paper moved towards more showbiz content spiced with sex, glamour and unique humour. Most issues came with a free gift, which could be free pints of lager, free downloads, free sex DVDs or even free tomato ketchup squeezy holders. In recent years, the paper has endured circulation difficulties as other publications mixing sex, humour, sport and news have launched and the ""Sport"" has come to be seen as outdated. The paper revamped its content and attempted to reposition itself, aiming to be a tabloid ""for men"". The managing director of Sport Newspapers, Andrew Fickling, said, ""We think there is an opportunity to take readers from the ""Star"" and ""The Sun"", as those papers feminise."" The ""Daily Sport"" and ""Sunday Sport"" helped launch the careers of many page 3 models, including Linsey Dawn Mckenzie, Solange Hop, Cherry Dee, Zoe Parker, Josie Shaw and Dani Thompson. "
wikipedia-363798," Sarah Josepha Hale  Sarah Josepha Buell Hale (October 24, 1788 – April 30, 1879) was an American writer and an influential editor. She is the author of the nursery rhyme ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". She famously campaigned for the creation of the American holiday known as Thanksgiving, and for the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument. Biography. Hale was born in Newport, New Hampshire, to Captain Gordon Buell and Martha Whittlesay Buell. Her parents believed in equal education for both sexes. Early in her life, she was educated by her mother and her brother Horatio, who taught her what he had learned at Dartmouth. Hale was otherwise an autodidact. While working as a schoolteacher in 1811, her father opened a tavern called The Rising Sun in Newport. She met David Hale the same year. The couple married at The Rising Sun on October 23, 1813, and had five children: David (1815), Horatio (1817), Frances (1819), Sarah (1820), William (1822). David Hale, a lawyer, died in 1822 and Sarah Josepha Hale wore black for the rest of her life as a sign of perpetual mourning. In 1823, with the financial support of her late husband's Freemason lodge, she published a collection of her poems titled ""The Genius of Oblivion"". Her novel, published in the U.S. under the title ""Northwood: Life North and South"" and in London under the title ""A New England Tale"", made her one of the first American women novelists and one of the first of either gender to write a book about slavery. The book, which espoused New England virtues as the model to follow for national prosperity, was immediately successful. The novel supported the relocation of the nation's African slaves to the colony of Liberia. In her introduction to the second edition (1852), Hale wrote; ""The great error of those who would sever the Union rather than see a slave within its borders, is, that they forget the master is their brother, as well as the servant; and that the spirit which seeks to do good to all and evil to none is the only true Christian philanthropy."" The premise of her book was that while slavery hurts and dehumanizes slaves absolutely, it also dehumanizes the masters and retards the psychological, moral and technological progress of their world. The book garnered praise from Reverend John Blake, who asked Hale to move to Boston to serve as the editor of his journal, the ""Ladies' Magazine"". She agreed and from 1828 until 1836 served as editor in Boston, though she preferred the title ""editress"". Hale hoped the magazine would help in educating women, as she wrote, ""not that they may usurp the situation, or encroach on the prerogatives of man; but that each individual may lend her aid to the intellectual and moral character of those within her sphere"". Her collection ""Poems for Our Children"", which includes ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" (originally titled ""Mary's Lamb""), was published in 1830. The poem was written for children, an audience for which many women poets of this period were writing. Hale founded the Seaman's Aid Society in 1833 to assist the surviving families of Boston sailors who died at sea. Louis Antoine Godey of Philadelphia wanted to hire Hale as the editor of his journal ""Godey's Lady's Book"". He bought the ""Ladies' Magazine"", now renamed ""American Ladies' Magazine"", and merged it with his journal. In 1837 Hale began working as editor of the expanded ""Godey's Lady's Book"" but insisted she edit from Boston while her youngest son, William, attended Harvard College. She remained editor at ""Godey's"" for forty years, retiring in 1877 when she was almost 90. During her tenure at ""Godey's"", several important women contributed poetry and prose to the magazine, including Lydia Sigourney, Caroline Lee Hentz, Elizabeth F. Ellet, and Frances Sargent Osgood. Other notable contributors included Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Washington Irving, James Kirke Paulding, William Gilmore Simms, and Nathaniel Parker Willis. During this time, she became one of the most important and influential arbiters of American taste. In its day, ""Godey's"", with no significant competitors, had an influence unimaginable for any single publication in the 21st century. The magazine is credited with an ability to influence fashions not only for women's clothes, but also in domestic architecture. ""Godey's"" published house plans that were copied by home builders nationwide. During this time, Hale wrote many novels and poems, publishing nearly fifty volumes by the end of her life. Beginning in the 1840s, she also edited several issues of the annual gift book ""The Opal"". Hale retired from editorial duties in 1877 at the age of 89. The same year, Thomas Edison spoke the opening lines of ""Mary's Lamb"" as the first speech ever recorded on his newly invented phonograph. Hale died at her home, 1413 Locust Street in Philadelphia, on April 30, 1879. She is buried in a simple grave in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Beliefs. Hale, as a successful and popular editor, was respected as an arbiter of taste for middle-class women in matters of fashion, cooking, literature, and morality. In her work, however, she was reinforcing stereotypical gender roles, specifically domestic roles for women,"" for women while casually trying to expand on it. For example, she believed that women shaped the morals of society, and pushed for women to write morally uplifting novels. She wrote that ""while the ocean of political life is heaving and raging with the storm of partisan passions among the men of America... as the true conservators of peace and good-will, should be careful to cultivate every gentle feeling"". She did not support women's suffrage and instead believed in the ""secret, silent influence of women"" to sway men voters. Hale was an advocate for education. She supported play and physical education as important learning experiences for children. She wrote in 1829 that ""Physical health and its attendant cheerfulness promote a happy tone of moral feeling, and they are quite indispensable to successful intellectual effort."" More specifically, she was an early advocate of women's education, particularly higher education for women; she helped in the founding of Vassar College. Her championship of education for women began with her editorship of the ""Ladies' Magazine"" and continued until she retired. She wrote no fewer than seventeen articles and editorials devoted to the subject of women's education, and is credited with helping make the founding of an all-women's college acceptable to a public unaccustomed to the idea. Her efforts in promoting women's education were rewarded in 1860 when the Baltimore Female College awarded her a medal ""for distinguished services in the cause of female education"". As an editor, she created a section headed ""Employment for Women"" beginning in 1852 discussing women's attempts to enter the workforce. She also published the works of Catharine Beecher, Emma Willard and other early advocates of education for women. Hale was also a strong advocate of the American nation and union. In the 1820s and 1830s, a time when other American magazines merely compiled and reprinted articles from British periodicals, Hale was among the leaders of a group of American editors who insisted on publishing American writers. In practical terms, this meant that she sometimes personally wrote half of the material published in the ""Ladies' Magazine"". In later years, it meant that she particularly liked to publish fiction with American themes, the frontier, and historical fiction set during the American Revolution. Hale adamantly opposed slavery and was strongly devoted to the Union. She campaigned in her pages for a unified American culture and nation, frequently running stories in which southerners and northerners fought together against the British, or in which a southerner and a northerner fell in love and married. Legacy. Hale is credited as the individual most responsible for making Thanksgiving a national holiday in the United States; it had previously been celebrated only in New England. Each state scheduled its own holiday, some as early as October and others as late as January; it was largely unknown in the American South. Her advocacy for the national holiday began in 1846 and lasted 17 years before it was successful. In support of the proposed national holiday, she wrote letters to five Presidents of the United States: Zachary Taylor, Millard Filmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln. Her initial letters failed to persuade, but the letter she wrote to Lincoln did convince him to support legislation establishing a national holiday of Thanksgiving in 1863. The new national holiday was considered a unifying day after the stress of the American Civil War. Prior to the addition of Thanksgiving, the only national holidays celebrated in the United States were Washington's Birthday and Independence Day. Hale advocated for the preservation of George Washington's Mount Vernon plantation, as a symbol of patriotism that both the Northern and Southern United States could all support. She raised the $30,000 in Boston for the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument. When construction stalled, Hale asked her readers to donate a dollar each and also organized a week-long craft fair at Quincy Market. The fair sold handmade jewelry, quilts, baskets, jams, jellies, cakes, pies, and autographed letters from Washington, James Madison, and the Marquis de Lafayette. She ""made sure the 221-foot obelisk that commemorates the battle of Bunker Hill got built."" As ""'Oprah and Martha Stewart combined,'"" Hale ""organized a giant craft fair at Quincy Market."" It was much more than a ""bake sale"" — ""refreshments were sold ... but they brought in only a fraction of the profit."" Liberty Ship #1538 (1943–1972) was named in her honor. A prestigious literary prize, the Sarah Josepha Hale Award, is named for her. She was further honored as the fourth in a series of historical bobblehead dolls created by the New Hampshire Historical Society and sold in their museum store in Concord, New Hampshire. Hale is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on April 30. Hale was also honored by having a New York City Board of Education vocational high school named after her. Sarah J. Hale High School was located on the corner of Dean St. and 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. The school closed in June 2001. "
wikipedia-363804," House of Assembly  House of Assembly is a name given to the legislature or lower house of a bicameral parliament. In some countries this may be at a subnational level. Historically, in British crown colonies as the colony gained more internal responsible government, the House of Assembly superseded the (usually unelected) Legislative Council as the colonial legislature, often becoming the lower house. "
wikipedia-363810," Tricameralism  Tricameralism is the practice of having three legislative or parliamentary chambers. It is contrasted to unicameralism and bicameralism, both of which are far more common. The term was used in South Africa to describe the Parliament established under the apartheid regime's new South African Constitution of 1983. Other instances of tricameral legislatures in history include Simón Bolívar's model state. The word could also describe the French Estates-General, which had three 'estates'. South African tricameralism. In 1983, South Africa's apartheid government put forward a constitution providing for a tricameral legislature. On 2 November, around seventy percent of the country's white population voted in favour of the changes — black South Africans were not consulted, and under the proposal they continued to be denied representation since in theory they were citizens of independent or autonomous bantustans.  The South African tricameral parliament consisted of three race-based chambers: The creation of the tricameral parliament was controversial on two fronts. On the one hand, many white conservatives disliked the idea of non-whites participating in Parliament at all. The dispute was a factor in the creation of the Conservative Party, a breakaway from the dominant National Party. On the other hand, many coloureds and Asians rejected the system as a sham, saying that the chambers reserved for them were powerless.  The tricameral parliament was not particularly strong. The 1983 constitution significantly weakened the powers of parliament, and abolished the position of Prime Minister. Most authority was transferred to the State President, including the ability to appoint the Cabinet. This was seen by many as an attempt to limit the power of coloureds and Indians — not only were the 'non-white' Houses of Parliament less powerful than the 'white' one, but parliament itself was subordinate to a white President. Bolívar's tricameralism. Simón Bolívar, the South American revolutionary leader, included a tricameral legislature as part of his proposals for a model government. Bolívar described the three houses as follows: Bolívar intended his model government to have a presidential system, and so the tricameral parliament was not expected to govern. Bolívar was explicit that the legislature should not have an active role in administration — it merely made law and supervised other branches of government. Despite Bolívar's huge influence in South America, no country employs his tricameral parliament. Early attempts to implement the model, such as in Bolivia, were not successful, although the chaos of the period was likely a factor in this outcome. French tricameralism. Ancien Régime. Some historians view the French States-General as an example of a tricameral legislature. The States-General evolved gradually over time, and provided advice on various matters (including legislative issues) to the King. The three Estates were the simply labeled First (consisting of clergy), Second (consisting of nobility), and Third (consisting of commoners). (The term ""fourth estate"", referring to the press, derives from this system, but was coined long after the revolution that abolished it.) There are problems with regarding the States-General as a tricameral legislature, however. Firstly, the States-General never had any formal powers to legislate, although at times, it played a major role in the King's legislative activity. Secondly, the division between the three estates was not always maintained — the estates sometimes deliberated separately, but at other times, they deliberated as a single body, undermining the idea of tricameralism. Consulate. The French Consulate (and later First French Empire, although the lower two chambers were by then entirely without power) had a tricameral legislature, consisting of: Whether the Sénat was part of legislature, however, is open to doubt, because Sieyès (the main instigator of the Consulate's Constitution and later president of this Senate) described it as belonging to an altogether different power beyond the executive, legislative and judiciary: the ""conservative"" power. In effect, Napoléon made the Sénat into a political élite to back his power as Consul and later as Emperor, whereas the other two chambers were subdued into submission. In 1807, the Tribunat was definitely abolished. Republic of China tricameralism. According to the original Constitution of the Republic of China (which is drafted according to the idea of Dr. Sun Yat-sen), under the National Assembly, there are five branches of government, named Yuan(院), which are: the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, and Control Yuan. The National Assembly represented the entire nation and exercised the political rights thereof, but its legislative functions were considered ""reserve"" powers that were meant to be exercised on an ad-hoc basis; the Legislative Yuan is the principal and standing legislative body, and the Control Yuan is the monitors the government. However, the constitution did not mention which is the parliament of the country. The Judicial Yuan decided that the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan resembled the parliament. Originally, the Control Yuan was elected, but later become nominated by the President. After the suspension of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan became the current unicameral parliament. Other examples. Former Yugoslavia. The Socialist Republic of Croatia had three houses in Parlament (Sabor Socijalističke republike Hrvatske, now Hrvatski Sabor): Socio-Political Council (Društveno-političko vijeće), Council of Municipalities (Vijeće općina) and Council of United Labor (Vijeće udruženog rada). This was abolished with new constitution in 1990. Isle of Man. The parliament of the Isle of Man, Tynwald, is sometimes called tricameral, but this description is not universally accepted. The two commonly accepted houses of Tynwald are the House of Keys and the Legislative Council, but according to some, the Tynwald Court (consisting of the members of both houses meeting together) counts as a third house. Others disagree, saying that as there are no members of the Court who are not also members of the other houses, the Court should not be considered separately (by comparison, in Australia, Switzerland and India deadlocks between the two Houses can sometimes be resolved by a joint sitting, but experts would not classify either of those countries as ""tricameral""). Church of England. The General Synod of the Church of England is sometimes described as tricameral. It is divided into a House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. As the Church of England is the state church of England, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has given the General Synod the power (subject to veto) to make law relating to the Church. However, a Diocesan Synod is not a tricameral institution. It is a bicameral institution, as it consists of the House of Laity, who are directly elected by the parishes, and the House of Clergy. The Bishop is not a member of either House, even though he is constitutionally a member of Synod. Labor unions. Tricameral meeting arrangements are a growing trend in labor unions where some members will always be working on one of three shifts. Under such arrangements, each shift will have its own meeting, but the action of one meeting will have to be adopted by the other two. "
wikipedia-363811," White Light/White Heat  White Light/White Heat is the second studio album by American rock band The Velvet Underground, released in 1968. It was the band's last with violist and founding member John Cale. In 2003, the album was ranked #293 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Recording. After the disappointing sales of the Velvet Underground's first album, ""The Velvet Underground & Nico"", the band's relationship with Andy Warhol deteriorated. They toured throughout most of 1967. Many of their live performances featured noisy improvisations that would become key elements on ""White Light/White Heat"". The band eventually fired Warhol and parted ways with Nico; and ultimately went on to record their second album with Tom Wilson credited as producer. The album was recorded in just two days, and with a noticeably different style than ""The Velvet Underground & Nico"". John Cale described ""White Light/White Heat"" as ""a very rabid record...The first one had some gentility, some beauty. The second one was consciously anti-beauty."" Sterling Morrison said, ""We were all pulling in the same direction. We may have been dragging each other off a cliff, but we were all definitely going in the same direction. In the ""White Light/White Heat"" era, our lives were chaos. That's what's reflected in the record."" During the recording of ""Sister Ray"", producer Tom Wilson reportedly left the studio rather than endure the cacophony. Themes and composition. Nearly every song on the album contains some sort of experimental or avant-garde quality. ""The Gift"", for example, contains a recital of a short story and a loud instrumental rock song playing simultaneously, with the former on the left speaker channel and the latter on the right. ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" is distinguishable for its distorted guitar solos and prominent use of feedback. The record's lyrics vary from themes of drug use and sexual references (such as fellatio and orgies), including the song ""Lady Godiva's Operation"", about a transsexual woman's botched lobotomy, and the title track ""White Light/White Heat"", which describes the use of amphetamine. ""Here She Comes Now"", the most straightforward 'pop' sounding song on the album, is built around a double-entendre. On the album's last track, ""Sister Ray"", Lou Reed tells a tale of debauchery involving drag queens having a failed orgy, while the band plays an improvised seventeen minute jam around three chords. Cover. The album cover to ""White Light/White Heat"" is a faint image of a tattoo of a skull. The picture of the tattooed arm was photographed, enlarged and distorted by Billy Name, one of the members of The Factory. It is difficult to distinguish the tattoo, as the image is black, printed on a slightly lighter black background. On this cover, the album name, the Verve logo, and the band name are all on one line. An alternative cover was used for Polydor's mid-1980s reissues. This cover had a completely black background, without the arm in the background. On this version, the album name, Verve logo, and band name are printed on three separate lines. There also exists a unique MGM Records UK cover, produced from 1976 until the early '80s, featuring a white background and abstract toy soldiers. Reception. Like other releases by the group, the album's socially transgressive lyrical themes and avant-garde instrumentation challenged the popular music sensibilities at the time, creating a muted reception. The album briefly appeared on the ""Billboard 200"", although only peaking at #199. Despite its poor sales, the distorted, feedback-driven, and roughly recorded sound on ""White Light/White Heat"" became a notable influence on punk and experimental rock. In 2003, the album was ranked #293 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, alongside other releases by the group. As an example of the album's influence on punk music, British rock band Buzzcocks formed loosely after members followed an advertisement looking for musicians who could collaborate on a ""Sister Ray"" cover. Track listing. All tracks written by Lou Reed, unless otherwise noted. "
wikipedia-381750," Hilbert's sixteenth problem  Hilbert's 16th problem was posed by David Hilbert at the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, as part of his list of 23 problems in mathematics. The original problem was posed as the ""Problem of the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces"" (""Problem der Topologie algebraischer Kurven und Flächen""). Actually the problem consists of two similar problems in different branches of mathematics: The first problem is yet unsolved for ""n"" = 8. Therefore, this problem is what usually is meant when talking about Hilbert's sixteenth problem in real algebraic geometry. The second problem also remains unsolved: no upper bound for the number of limit cycles is known for any ""n"">1, and this is what usually is meant by Hilbert's sixteenth problem in the field of dynamical systems. The first part of Hilbert's 16th problem. In 1876 Harnack investigated algebraic curves in the real projective plane and found that curves of degree ""n"" could have no more than separate connected components. Furthermore he showed how to construct curves that attained that upper bound, and thus that it was the best possible bound. Curves with that number of components are called M-curves. Hilbert had investigated the M-curves of degree 6, and found that the 11 components always were grouped in a certain way. His challenge to the mathematical community now was to completely investigate the possible configurations of the components of the M-curves. Furthermore he requested a generalization of Harnack's Theorem to algebraic surfaces and a similar investigation of surfaces with the maximum number of components. The second part of Hilbert's 16th problem. Here we are going to consider polynomial vector fields in the real plane, that is a system of differential equations of the form: where both ""P"" and ""Q"" are real polynomials of degree ""n"". These polynomial vector fields were studied by Poincaré, who had the idea of abandoning the search for finding exact solutions to the system, and instead attempted to study the qualitative features of the collection of all possible solutions. Among many important discoveries, he found that the limit sets of such solutions need not be a stationary point, but could rather be a periodic solution. Such solutions are called limit cycles. The second part of Hilbert's 16th problem is to decide an upper bound for the number of limit cycles in polynomial vector fields of degree ""n"" and, similar to the first part, investigate their relative positions. Results. It was shown in 1991/1992 by Yulii Ilyashenko and Jean Écalle that every polynomial vector field in the plane has only finitely many limit cycles (a 1923 article by Henri Dulac claiming a proof of this statement had been shown to contain a gap in 1981). This statement is not obvious, since it is easy to construct smooth (C∞) vector fields in the plane with infinitely many concentric limit cycles. The question whether there exists a finite upper bound ""H""(""n"") for the number of limit cycles of planar polynomial vector fields of degree ""n"" remains unsolved for any ""n"">1. (""H""(1) = 0 since linear vector fields do not have limit cycles.) Evgenii Landis and Ivan Petrovsky claimed a solution in the 1950s, but it was shown wrong in the early 1960s. Quadratic plane vector fields with four limit cycles are known. The original formulation of the problems. In his speech, Hilbert presented the problems as: Hilbert continues: "

History. The name, ""Aldwych"", derives from the Old English ""eald"" and ""wic"" meaning 'old trading town' or 'old marketplace'; the name was later applied to the street and district. It was recorded as ""Aldewich"" in 1211. In the seventh century, an Anglo-Saxon village and trading centre named ""Lundenwic"" (""London trading town"") was established approximately one mile to the west of ""Londinium"" (named ""Lundenburh"" or ""London Fort"" by the Saxons) in what is now Aldwych. ""Lundenwic"" probably used the mouth of the River Fleet as a harbour or anchorage for trading ships and fishing boats. ""Lundenwic"" was 'rediscovered' in the 1980s after the results of extensive excavations were reinterpreted as being urban in character. These conclusions were reached independently by the archaeologists, Alan Vince and Martin Biddle. Recent excavations in the Covent Garden area have uncovered an extensive Anglo-Saxon settlement, covering about , stretching from the present-day National Gallery site in the west to Aldwych in the east. As the presumed locus of the city, ""Lundenburh"", was moved back within the old Roman walls, the older settlement of ""Lundenwic"" gained the name of ""ealdwic"": ""old settlement"", a name which evolved into ""Aldwych"". The modern street was created in a redevelopment in the early twentieth century, that saw the demolition of the old Wych Street and the construction of Australia House (built 1913-18) and Bush House (completed in 1925). A statue of the nineteenth-century prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, was installed in 1905 near St. Clement Danes church. On 18 February 1996, a bomb detonated prematurely on a Number 171 bus travelling along Aldwych, killing Edward O'Brien, the IRA operative transporting the device; it also injured four others. "
wikipedia-381774," Compressed air  Compressed air is air kept under a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. It serves many domestic and industrial purposes. In Europe, 10 percent of all industrial electricity consumption is to produce compressed air—amounting to 80 terawatt hours consumption per year. Uses. In industry, compressed air is so widely used that it is often regarded as the fourth utility, after electricity, natural gas and water. However, compressed air is more expensive than the other three utilities when evaluated on a per unit energy delivered basis. Compressed air is used for many purposes, including: Compressed Air Riser Piping from Air Compressor(s). The riser piping should connect to the top of the header piping and be one pipe size larger than the compressor discharge piping and/or overhead header piping. A drip leg with a drain is needed to prevent water from flowing back to the compressor. Mount valves in the highest horizontal piping (this avoids the hazard of opening a closed valve in vertical piping, and releasing trapped condensate to flow back into air compressors). All of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1/8"" to 1/4"" per foot down and away from the point of origin. Gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at to accessible drop legs and drain points. These drops should be installed every 50 to 70 feet in the system and be taken from the bottom of the main line to insure as much removal as possible. The header piping up to the air dryers is exposed to moist, hot air (temperatures can reach well over 150 degrees F). Copper, stainless steel and other piping materials that are less corrosive are recommended. If plain carbon steel piping is installed, then rust particles can pass downstream and interfere with the operation of condensate valves and wye strainers. The inlet piping for Air Dryer(s) should connect to the bottom of the piping headers. Compressed Air Rooms with Multiple Air Compressors. Where multiple air compressors are to connect the riser piping to the top of overhead piping headers. The inlet piping for Air Dryer(s) should connect to the bottom of the piping headers. Compressed Air Distribution Piping outside of Air Compressors Rooms. All of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1/8"" per foot down from the point of origin. Gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at to accessible drop legs and drain points. For larger plant, as the piping elevation lowers, a full size tee with a bottom drip leg preceding an elbow turned up to raise the pipe elevation. These drip legs & up turned elbows are typically 200 to 300 feet apart, i.e. the main piping slopes about 1/100 feet, and the elbow up raises the piping elevation 2 to 3 feet. Compressed air should flow through the straight ends of a tee and should never hit the back side of a tee. Compressed Air Piping Drops. The air piping drops should connect from the top of the main piping. This prevents any condensate which forms in the main piping from flowing into the branch pipes. Individual shut-off valves should be installed (in the horizontal section of the connection piping above the main piping) at each drop pipe to isolate it from the rest of the system for maintenance. "
wikipedia-381776," Bobolink  The Bobolink (""Dolichonyx oryzivorus"") is a small New World blackbird and the only member of genus ""Dolichonyx"". Description. Adults are 16–18 cm (6–8 in) long with short finch-like bills. They weigh about . Adult males are mostly black, although they do display creamy napes, and white scapulars, lower backs, and rumps. Adult females are mostly light brown, although their coloring includes black streaks on the back and flanks, and dark stripes on the head; their wings and tails are darker. The collective name for a group of Bobolinks is a ""chain"". Distribution and movements. These birds migrate to Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. One bird was tracked flying over the course of the year, and up to in one day. They often migrate in flocks, feeding on cultivated grains and rice, which leads to them being considered a pest by farmers in some areas. Although Bobolinks migrate long distances, they have rarely been sighted in Europe—like many vagrants from the Americas, the overwhelming majority of records are from the British Isles. Each fall, Bobolinks gather in large numbers in South American rice fields, where they are inclined to eat grain. This has earned them the name ""ricebird"" in these parts. However, they are called something entirely different in Jamaica (Butterbirds) where they are collected as food, being that they are very fat as they pass through on migration. Behaviour. Breeding. Their breeding habitats are open grassy fields, especially hay fields, across North America. In high-quality habitats, males are often polygynous. Females lay 5 to 6 eggs in a cup-shaped nest, which is always situated on the ground and is usually well-hidden in dense vegetation. Both parents feed the young. Feeding. Bobolinks forage on or near the ground, and mainly eat seeds and insects. Calls. Males sing bright, bubbly songs in flight; these songs gave this species its common name. Status and conservation. The numbers of these birds are declining due to loss of habitat. In Vermont, a 75% decline was noted between 1966 to 2007. Originally, they were found in tall grass prairie and other open areas with dense grass. Although hay fields are suitable nesting habitat, fields which are harvested early, or at multiple times, in a season may not allow sufficient time for young birds to fledge. This species increased in numbers when horses were the primary mode of transportation, requiring larger supplies of hay. Media references. Emily Dickinson penned many poems about the bird The Bobolink is mentioned in the song Evelina by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, from the musical Bloomer Girl: The bird is also one of the many important ornithological references in Vladimir Nabokov's John Shade's poem ""Pale Fire"" in the novel of the same name. Sophia Jewett ends her poem ""An Exile's Garden"" (1910) with a reference to a Bobolink. The bobolink is also mentioned in the film The Mouse on the Moon in connection with the fictional European microstate of Grand Fenwick,where oddly the bird is apparently common. "
wikipedia-381782," NumPy  NumPy is an extension to the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of Numarray into Numeric with extensive modifications. NumPy is open source and has many contributors. Traits. Because Python is currently implemented as an interpreter, mathematical algorithms written in it often run slower than compiled equivalents. Numpy seeks to address this problem for numerical algorithms by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays. Thus any algorithm that can be expressed primarily as operations on arrays and matrices can run almost as quickly as the equivalent C code. Using NumPy in Python gives functionality comparable to MATLAB since they are both interpreted, and they both allow the user to write fast programs as long as most operations work on arrays or matrices instead of scalars. In comparison, MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes, notably Simulink; whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with Python, a more modern, complete, and open source programming language. Moreover complementary Python packages are available; SciPy is a library that adds more MATLAB-like functionality and Matplotlib is a plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality. Internally, both MATLAB and NumPy rely on BLAS and LAPACK for efficient linear algebra computations. The ndarray data structure. The core functionality of NumPy is its ""ndarray"", for ""n""-dimensional array, data structure. These arrays are strided views on memory. In contrast to Python's built-in list data structure (which, despite the name, is a dynamic array), these arrays are homogeneously typed: all elements of a single array must be of the same type. Inside C/C++/Cython extensions to the CPython interpreter (the only Python implementation supported by NumPy), ndarrays may be constructed from arbitrary memory buffers, and NumPy has built-in support for memory-mapped ndarrays. Routines. The following routines (grouped by functionality) are provided by numpy :  Example. The following is a simple example of how to do interactive array manipulations and plot a graph with NumPy and Matplotlib. History. NumPy is based on two earlier Python array packages. The original one, Numeric, which is reasonably complete and stable, remains available, but is now obsolete. It was originally written in 1995 largely by Jim Hugunin with the help of many people including Jim Fulton, David Ascher, Paul DuBois, and Konrad Hinsen. A newer implementation, Numarray, is a complete rewrite of Numeric but is also deprecated. NumPy is a merge between the two that builds on the code base of Numeric and adds the features of Numarray. There was a desire to get Numeric into the Python standard library, but Guido van Rossum (the author of Python) was quite clear that the code was not maintainable in its state then. Another problem was that for large arrays Numeric is very slow. As a result, another package called Numarray was created. Numarray is faster for large arrays, but slower for small arrays. For a time both Numeric and Numarray were used, both with different ways to accomplish similar goals. The last version of Numeric v24.2 was released on 11 November 2005 and numarray v1.5.2 was released on 24 August 2006. In early 2005, Travis Oliphant wanted to unify the community around a single array package. The Numeric code was adapted to make it more maintainable and flexible enough to implement the novel features of Numarray. This new project was part of SciPy. To avoid installing a whole package just to get an array object, this new package was separated and called NumPy. While the source code is freely available and it contains significant documentation, there is also an extensive official ""Guide to NumPy"". The documentation is built around a unified docstring standard. The release version 1.5.1 of NumPy is compatible with Python versions 2.4–2.7 and 3.1–3.2. Support for Python 3 was added in 1.5.0. In 2011, PyPy started development on an implementation of the numpy API for PyPy. Video sources. There are several videos recorded in the seminars and the conferences. These videos may help beginners learn how NumPy works. 2009 SciPy meeting had several sessions on SciPy and NumPy. "
wikipedia-381784," Laryngeal cancer  Laryngeal cancer may also be called cancer of the larynx or laryngeal carcinoma. Most laryngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, reflecting their origin from the squamous cells which form the majority of the laryngeal epithelium. Cancer can develop in any part of the larynx, but the cure rate is affected by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of tumour staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis. Most laryngeal cancers originate in the glottis. Supraglottic cancers are less common, and subglottic tumours are least frequent. Laryngeal cancer may spread by direct extension to adjacent structures, by metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes, or more distantly, through the blood stream. Distant metastates to the lung are most common. Risk factors. Smoking is the most important risk factor for laryngeal cancer. Death from laryngeal cancer is 20 times more likely for heaviest smokers than for nonsmokers. Heavy chronic consumption of alcohol, particularly alcoholic spirits, is also significant. When combined, these two factors appear to have a synergistic effect. Some other quoted risk factors are likely, in part, to be related to prolonged alcohol and tobacco consumption. These include low socioeconomic status, male sex, and age greater than 55 years. People with a history of head and neck cancer are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of developing a second cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is mainly because in a significant proportion of these patients, the aerodigestive tract and lung epithelium have been exposed chronically to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and tobacco. In this situation, a field change effect may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely dysplastic with a reduced threshold for malignant change. This risk may be reduced by quitting alcohol and tobacco. Symptoms. The symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the size and location of the tumor. Symptoms may include the following: Incidence. Incidence is five in 100,000 (12,500 new cases per year) in the USA. The American Cancer Society estimated that 9,510 men and women (7,700 men and 1,810 women) would be diagnosed with and 3,740 men and women would die of laryngeal cancer in 2006. Laryngeal cancer is listed as a ""rare disease"" by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This means that laryngeal cancer affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Each year, about 2,200 people in the U.K. are diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. The disease is also rarely seen in Canada. The disease affected only 128 individuals in the province of British Columbia in 2009, the majority being males. Diagnosis. Diagnosis is made by the doctor on the basis of a medical history, physical examination, and special investigations which may include a chest x-ray, CT or MRI scans, and tissue biopsy. The examination of the larynx requires some expertise, which may require specialist referral. The physical exam includes a systematic examination of the whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used. If there is a suspicion of cancer, biopsy is performed, usually under general anaesthetic. This provides histological proof of cancer type and grade. If the lesion appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour at the time of first biopsy. In this situation, the pathologist will not only be able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full endoscopic examination of the larynx, trachea, and esophagus is often performed at the time of biopsy.  For small glottic tumours further imaging may be unnecessary. In most cases, tumour staging is completed by scanning the head and neck region to assess the local extent of the tumour and any pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The final management plan will depend on the site, stage (tumour size, nodal spread, distant metastasis), and histological type. The overall health and wishes of the patient must also be taken into account. A prognostic multigene classifier has been shown to be potentially useful for the distinction of laryngeal cancer of low or high risk of recurrence and might influence the treatment choice in future. Staging. Epithelial tumors are classified according to the guidelines set by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) (3,4). T classification The T classification represents the extent of the primary tumor. Supraglottis T1 – Tumor is limited to one side of the supraglottis with normal mobility of the vocal cord(s).  T2 – Tumor invades the vocal cord without fixation of the larynx.  T3 – Tumor is limited to the larynx with fixation of the vocal cord and/or infiltration of the postcricoid area, pre-epiglottic tissues or most likely erosion of thyroid cartilage.  T4a – Tumor invades through thyroid cartilage or down into the trachea and soft tissue contents of the neck. T4b – Tumor invades prevertebral space, mediastinal structures or encases carotid artery. Glottis T1 – Tumor limited to vocal cord(s) with normal mobility.  a - Tumor limited to one vocal cord. b - Tumor involves both vocal cords. T2 – Tumor extends to supraglottis and/or subglottis, and/or with impaired vocal cord mobility. T3 – Tumor limited to larynx with vocal cord fixation and/or invades paraglottic space or with probable thyroid cartilage erosion. T4a – Tumor invades through thyroid cartilage, the trachea, soft tissues of the neck/tongue.  T4b – Tumor invades prevertebral space, mediastinal structures, or carotid artery. Subglottis is very rare. N classification The N classification represents spreading to regional lymph nodes on the neck. The widest diameter is measured. N0 – no regional lymph node metastases N1 – single ipsilateral lymph node metastasis ≤ 3 cm N2 a – single ipsilateral lymph node metastasis > 3 cm ≤ 6 cm b – multiple ipsilateral lymph node metastases ≤ 6 cm c – bilateral or contralateral lymph node metastases ≤ 6 cm N3 – lymph node metastases > 6 cm M classification The M classification represents distant metastases. M0 – no distance metastases M1 – distant metastases External link showing illustrations of the different stages. Treatment. Specific treatment depends on the location, type, and stage of the tumour. Treatment may involve surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. This is a specialised area which requires the coordinated expertise of ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons (otolaryngologists) and oncologists. "
wikipedia-381794," Adam's apple  The Adam's apple (technically known as the laryngeal prominence) is a feature of the human neck and refers to the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.  The structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. The meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90°) in men, while in women, an open arc (of about 120°). Terminology. There are two main theories as to the origin of the term' ""Adam's apple"".  The """"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable"""" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary points at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions). However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian writings mention it. The biblical story does not actually specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. Linguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal protuberance was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was """"pomum Adami"""" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew """"tappuach ha adam"""" meaning ""male bump"". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language, the proper name ""Adam"" (אדם) literally means ""man"", and the late Hebrew word used to refer ""bump"" is very similar to the word used to refer ""apple"". Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the beginning. The medical term ""prominentia laryngea"" was introduced by the ""Basle Nomina Anatomica"" in 1895. Sexual characteristic. Although both sexes have it, Adam's apple is considered a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. Its development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males, that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies between individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly. Anatomical function. The Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal chords (which are located directly behind it).  Another function of the laryngeal protuberance is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal protrusion grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus, and, as a result, the man gets a deeper tone. Surgery. Cosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty). The surgery is effective and tends to have few complications, and any complications tend to be transient. "
wikipedia-381797," James Franck  James Franck (26 August 1882 – 21 May 1964) was a German physicist and Nobel laureate. Biography. Franck was Jewish; his parents were Jacob Franck and Rebecca Nachum Drucker. He completed his Ph.D. in 1906 and received his ""venia legendi"", or Habilitation, for physics in 1911, both at the University of Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of extraordinarius professor.  Franck served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. Franck became the Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became ordinarius professor of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there he worked on quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. In 1925, Franck received the Nobel Prize in Physics, mostly for his work in 1912–1914, which included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, Franck, being a Jew, decided to leave his post in Germany and continued his research in the United States, first at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then, after a year in Denmark, in Chicago. It was there that he became involved in the Manhattan Project during World War II; he was Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. He was also the chairman of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb; the committee consisted of himself and other scientists at the Met Lab, including Donald J. Hughes, J. J. Nickson, Eugene Rabinowitch, Glenn T. Seaborg, J. C. Stearns and Leó Szilárd. The committee is best known for the compilation of the Franck Report, finished on 11 June 1945, which recommended not to use the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities, based on the problems resulting from such a military application. When Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in World War II, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold Nobel Prizes of Max von Laue and James Franck in aqua regia to prevent the Nazis from stealing them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prizes using the original gold. In 1946 Franck married Hertha Sponer, his former assistant in Göttingen. He died suddenly in 1964 while visiting Göttingen. "
wikipedia-381799," Lew Welch  Lewis Barrett ""Lew"" Welch, Jr. (August 16, 1926 – May 1971) was an American poet associated with the Beat generation of poets, artists, and iconoclasts. Welch published and performed widely during the 1960s. He taught a poetry workshop as part of the University of California Extension in San Francisco from 1965 to 1970. On May 23, 1971, he was believed to have committed suicide, after leaving a note. His body was never found. Early life. Welch was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but moved with his mother and sister to California in 1929. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1944 but never saw active service. He worked for a period before joining Stockton Junior College, where he developed an interest in the works of Gertrude Stein. In 1948, Welch moved to Portland, Oregon to attend Reed College. There he roomed with poets Gary Snyder and Philip Whalen. Welch decided to become a writer after reading Gertrude Stein's long story ""Melanctha."" Welch wrote his thesis on Stein and published poems in student magazines. William Carlos Williams visited the college and met the three poets. He admired Welch's early poems and tried to get his Stein thesis published. The world of advertising. After college, Welch moved to New York City, where he worked writing copy in the advertising industry. Welch was said to have come up with the advertising slogan,""Raid Kills Bugs Dead"", but others have questioned this claim. During this time, Welch started to display emotional and mental problems and went to Florida to take a course of therapy.  He then went to the University of Chicago, where he studied philosophy and English. In Chicago, he joined the advertising department of Montgomery Ward. He was working there at the time of the famous poetry reading at the Six Gallery in San Francisco that launched what was to become known as the San Francisco Renaissance. Later life and work. Wanting to get back to poetry, Welch applied for a transfer to Montgomery Ward's Oakland headquarters. After the return to California, he started to get involved in the San Francisco literary scene. He soon gave up advertising and earned a living driving a cab while devoting more time to writing. He became an active participant in Beat culture, living at various times with Snyder and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In 1960, poet Lenore Kandel met Welch and Snyder, who introduced her to many people in the Beat movement. Jack Kerouac based his character Dave Wain in his novel ""Big Sur"" (1962) on Welch. In 1968, Welch signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Marriage and family. He had a common-law relationship with Polish refugee Magda Cregg. He acted as the stepfather of her son Hugh Anthony Cregg, III. Cregg later chose the stage-name Huey Lewis in honor of Welch. Death. On May 23, 1971, he walked out of poet Gary Snyder's house in the mountains of California, leaving behind a suicide note. He had carried a stainless steel heavy-frame Smith & Wesson .22 caliber revolver. His body was never found. Bibliography. Note: Before committing suicide in 1971, Lew Welch left a note naming Donald Allen his literary executor. Donald Allen published much of Welch's work posthumously via Grey Fox Press. "
wikipedia-381800," Hollywood North  Hollywood North, an allusion to Hollywood, California, a notable film centre in the world, is a colloquialism used to describe film production industries and or film locations north of its namesake. The term has been applied principally to the film industry in Canada, specifically Toronto and Vancouver. Canada. The term ""Hollywood North"" has been used to describe aspects of Canadian film and television production since the late 1970s, even appearing in the titles of books (i.e. ""Hollywood North: The Feature Film Industry in British Columbia"") and films (""Hollywood North""). The title has been claimed for both Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, although it is also used generically as a description of the entire Canadian film industry. Toronto. One of the earliest Hollywood television series to shoot in Toronto was the 1957 production ""Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans"". The city has been associated with the nickname 'Hollywood North' since the late 1970s, due to its role as a production centre for both domestic and international film projects. In 1979 Toronto mayor John Sewell announced that Canada had become the third largest movie production centre after Los Angeles and New York. In 2002 the year Toronto's Film and Television industry accounted for $1.16 billion towards the city's economy, former Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman proclaimed ""Toronto is Hollywood North"". In 2003 the Toronto Ontario Film Office was established in Los Angeles to promote the benefits of filming in the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario. With the TOFO Ontario is the only Canadian province to have an office in Hollywood. The province of Ontario had 230 film projects with $946 million in production spending in 2010. Ontario ranks as the largest film and television production centre in Canada, and third overall in North America behind California and New York. A decline in BC's domestic production and an increase of $300 million or 31% over the previous year, allowed Ontario to surpass British Columbia for the largest production centre in Canada in 2011. The province recorded $1.26 billion in production activity in 2011, its largest year ever. Toronto ranks second as an exporter of television programming in North America and behind only Los Angeles and New York City among North American cities in total industry production, $903.5 million were spent by production companies on 209 major production film and television projects in 2010 in Toronto. In 2011, the film industry contributed $1.13 billion from 244 on location film and television projects to Toronto the largest figure since the year 2002, this increase in revenue over the past years was attributed to a film tax credit offered by the provincial government in 2009. A 47% increase in Hollywood productions in 2011 over 2010 was mostly attributed to this tax credit among others. In 2012 on location film and television production increased again to $1.2 billion generated. Toronto is the home base for Alliance Atlantis, the largest distribution company in Canada, and the 12th largest film and TV distribution company in the world, which distributes films and television across all of North America and parts of Europe. Toronto is also the headquarters of Nelvana, the largest animation company in Canada and one of the largest animation/children's entertainment studios in the world. Pinewood Toronto Studios located in Toronto, Canada is Canada's largest film and television production complex, with more than of production space. It contains the largest purpose-built sound stage in North America, capable of accommodating large blockbuster movies. Some have credited the completion of Pinewood Studios along with provincial tax credits as being responsible for the late 2000s/early 2010's surge in in-province Hollywood productions. Due to its ability to handle film productions on a scale not previously possible. The Toronto Film and Television Office reported that in 2005 some 200 productions were completed in Toronto: 39 features, and 44 movies made for television, 84 television series, 11 television specials, and 22 MOW's (movies of the week). The Toronto Film and Television Office issued 4,154 location filming permits for 1,258 projects totalling 7,319 days of shooting. Toronto's domestic production industry benefits greatly financially from large treaty coproductions with international partners. As with Vancouver, government tax incentives at both the provincial and federal level promote Toronto as a destination for many US film productions. The city is often used as a stand in for New York City and Chicago in film. In addition to being a productions centre, Toronto is the home to the Toronto International Film Festival, which is considered by many in the film industry to be second only to Cannes in terms of influence or in instances actually rivaling it. It attracts numerous high-profile actors and film makers form around the globe to premiere their Films in Toronto and is generally considered the tip-off point to which the Oscar races begin. Toronto is home to Canada's Walk of Fame, similar in appearance to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honouring notable Canadians. Toronto is the headquarters to the majority of Canada's national media outlets including: CBC Television, CTV, Global Television Network, MuchMusic, YTV, and entertainment programs ETalk and ""Entertainment Tonight"". The city is the traditional host for the Gemini Awards, honouring the Canadian television industry. Vancouver. Vancouver has been used as a filmmaking location for over a century, beginning with ""The Cowpuncher's Glove"" and ""The Ship's Husband"", both shot in 1910 by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Isolated by distance from the domestic film production communities in Toronto and Montreal, it became known as ""Hollywood North"" for its role as a production centre for US feature films shot in British Columbia. The provincial government first established a film development office in 1977 to market the province to the Hollywood community. In 2000, BC crossed the billion-dollar mark in production for the first time, and in 2002, 75% of all Canadian foreign productions were based in British Columbia and Ontario. That same year British Columbia led the country in foreign film production receiving 44% of the Canadian total. British Columbia held the ranking of third largest production centre for film and television in North America, after Los Angeles and New York City, with over 246 motion picture projects and $1.02 billion on production spending in 2010. However, declining domestic production in the province through 2011 and less competitive tax rates left BC ranked fourth in overall production after Ontario for the first time since 2004 although it still leads in foreign production. North Shore Studios - formally Lionsgate Studios - and Vancouver Film Studios are among the two largest special effects stages in Canada. VFS being one of the largest production facility outside of Los Angeles; Bridge Studios, in Burnaby, British Columbia, has one of the largest special effects stages in North America. Mammoth Studios, a subsidiary of North Shore studios holds the largest film stages in the world, their largest at . The BC Film Commission reported that in 2005, more than 200 productions were completed in B.C.: 63 feature films, 31 television series, 37 movies-of-the-week, 15 television pilots, 5 miniseries, 20 documentaries, 16 short films and 24 animation projects. In 2006, spending on film and TV production in B.C. was $1.228 billion. . The Late-2000s recession or sometimes referred to as the December 2007 Recession, hit the film industry financially on all levels. By March 2008, the British Columbia film industry dramatically recovered with film spending at $1.2 billion, with foreign-film production increasing 146 percent and domestic animation by 79 percent. In total, 86 foreign productions including 40 feature length films, were completed in 2008. The city is also host to the Vancouver International Film Festival and the Vancouver Film and Television Forum. Over the last few years, many states and provinces have increased their tax incentives matching and even exceeding the ones offered in British Columbia which has made it more competitive for the province. These states include Georgia (30% based on a minimum investment of $500,000 ), New Mexico (20% Refundable Tax Credit ), and North Carolina (25% Refundable Tax Credit ). Vancouver is from Hollywood, a three hour airplane flight or a twenty-one hour drive. It is also in the same time zone as Los Angeles. This relative proximity coupled with government subsidies is a major factor in the growth of Vancouver's production industry. Proximity reduces issues over operating hours, accessibility, travel time for principals, access to filmmaking infrastructure, and experience of crews. Another reason why foreign producers choose Vancouver to film is because of the consistent cloud cover as this weather naturally diffuses natural sunlight which makes it easier for technicians to add additional light. "
wikipedia-381804," Anarchism and Marxism  Anarchism and Marxism are similar political philosophies which emerged in the nineteenth century. While Anarchism and Marxism are both complex movements driven by internal conflict, as ideological movements their primary attention has been on human liberation achieved through political action. Similarly, both have been intensely interested in abolishing social inequalities present in societies as a result of wage labour and the Industrial Revolution. In their most socially significant forms, both movements have been revolutionary, and have focused on the working class as the agent of revolution. As working class movements Marxism and anarchism have been sometimes allied and sometimes opposed groups. In particular revolutions there has been significant armed conflict between Marxist and anarchist groups. Conflicts between anarchist and Marxist movements have emerged in terms of theory, strategy, practice and immediate political goals. Agreements between anarchism and Marxism have tended to focus on ideological convergence based around the concept of the working class as the group that creates real human freedom. The first major ideological conflict between anarchists and Marxists occurred within the First International, a European revolutionary communist political movement. The first major armed conflicts between anarchists and Marxists occurred during the 1917–1923 revolutions in the Russian Empire between urban anarchists, rural Makhnovist anarchists, the Marxist Menshevik Russian Social Democratic Party and the Marxist Bolshevik Russian Social Democratic Party. A major armed conflict occurred during the Spanish Civil War between the Spanish anarchist movement and the Soviet Union-supported central government.  After World War Two, in the West major conflicts between anarchism and Marxism have been generally confined to sectarian left-wing bickering between anarchist groups and Trotskyist or Trotsky-inspired organisations over minor points of tactics or language use. Additionally, since the New Left period, major convergences between minor trends of thought within Marxism and anarchism have occurred, generally in the area of exploring working class self-liberation. After the fall of the Soviet Union, little conflict has occurred between Stalin, post-Stalin or Stalin-inspired Marxists and anarchists, due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union's influence within Marxist circles. Prior to 2000, there was little conflict between pro-property anarchism and Marxism, due to the small size of pro-property anarchist movements and the focus of pro-property anarchist movements on behavioural change within their own perceived movement. Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber has distinguished the two philosophies as follows: Historical relationships between anarchists and Marxists. International Workingmen's Association. The International Workingmen's Association (the First International), at its founding, was an alliance of socialist groups, including both anarchists and Marxists. Both sides had a common aim and common enemies. But each was critical of the other, and the inherent conflict between the two groups soon embodied itself in an ongoing argument between Mikhail Bakunin, representative of anarchist ideas, and Karl Marx himself. The Marxist branch tended to support the formation of workers' or socialist parties that participated in parliamentary politics in Western liberal democracies to advance their agendas, while anarchists tended to criticize parliamentary politics as not being sufficiently democratic ""from the bottom up"" and as providing no democratic control over the workplace and the means of production. In 1872, the conflict in the First International climaxed with the expulsion of Bakunin and those who had become known as the ""Bakuninists"" when they were outvoted by the Marx party at the Hague Congress. Their ideas might have been quite similar (possible non statist marxists explained by Chomsky). Industrial Workers of the World. In the late 19th and early 20th century, many Marxists and anarchists joined syndicalist movements for militant revolutionary labor unions, such as the Industrial Workers of the World. The IWW drew upon principles of Anarchism and Marxism.  Many communists left the IWW in the period from 1919 to 1925 due to an ideological split between centralists and decentralists within the IWW, and with encouragement from the Bolshevik government in Moscow to work within the more mainstream American Federation of Labor unions. The decentralists, or E.P.-ers (for Emergency Program) in the IWW opposed an emphasis on political action, and favored a greater focus on organizing centered within stronger industrial union divisions. Russian Revolution. Both anarchists and Marxists participated in the overthrow of the Tsar in February 1917 in the beginning stages of the 1917 Russian Revolution. However, a hostile relationship quickly developed between anarchists and Bolsheviks, so that anarchists generally opposed the Bolshevik-initiated transfer of power from the Provisional Government to the Bolshevik commissars (acting on behalf of Bolshevik-led workers councils—known in Russian as ""soviets""), in October 1917. Even the ensuing civil war pitting the Bolshevik government and Red Army against the Tsarist White Armies did not reconcile anarchists and Bolsheviks.  The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, led by anarchists, fought counter-revolutionary forces in a tenuous alliance with the Red Army. These Ukrainian anarchists were highly critical of other anarchists in the Russian Revolution who lacked their discipline. The RIAU was later suppressed by Red Army over the issue of the integration of the RIAU into the Red Army. Russian anarchists were the first organized victims of the CHEKA in April and May 1918. They were arguing for free soviets, freedom of expression and association and the establishment of free communes on the basis of voluntary association. As a result of their interpretation of the Bolshevik hegemony over the revolution, some urban anarchists engaged in protest and civil disobedience. Most Russian anarchists were imprisoned and their press silenced.  At the end of the civil war, sailors at Kronstadt influenced by anarchists and dissident Marxists mutinied, demanding more political liberties while defending socialism and workers' democracy, and were surrounded, attacked, and suffered reprisal by mass execution and political imprisonment at the hands of the Bolshevik Red Army and political police. Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, although the anarchists and Marxists both fought in a united front against the fascist movement of General Francisco Franco, the revolutionary Marxists of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), the anarcho-syndicalists of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), and the anarchists of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) faced repression and attacks from the Communist party. Attempted theoretical syntheses. A number of political ideologies and movements have attempted some degree of synthesis of the Marxist and anarchist traditions with the aim of a liberated workers' society. These include the followers of Joseph Dietzgen in the 19th century, syndicalism, Jan Wacław Machajski, De Leonism, and council communism in the first half of the 20th century, and the Situationist International and Autonomist Marxism in the second half of the 20th century. The modern Zapatista Army of National Liberation movement in Chiapas, Mexico also incorporates both anarchist and Marxist ideas, along with indigenous Mayan political thought. Alliances and joint movements. There have been overlaps between Anarchism and Marxism historically, including hybrid movements of anarchism and anti-authoritarian Marxism such as libertarian Marxism and Autonomism. Arguments surrounding the issue of the state. Modern political scientists generally define the ""state"" as a centralized, hierarchical, governing institution which maintains a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force, in keeping with the definition originally proposed by the German sociologist Max Weber in his 1918 essay ""Politics as a Vocation"". Marxists, and some anarchists, dispute this definition. Marxism has a unique definition of the state: that the state is an organ of one class's repression of all other classes. To Marxists, any state is intrinsically a dictatorship by one class over all others. Therefore, within Marxist theory, should the differentiation between classes disappear, so too will the state. However, there is some convergence of views. Anarchists believe that any state—be it a worker's state or a bourgeois state—will inevitably be created and ruled by a political and economic elite, therefore becoming an organ of class domination. Conversely, Marxists believe that successful class repression almost always requires a superior capacity for violence, and that all societies prior to socialism are ruled by a minority class, so that in Marxist theory any non-socialist state will possess the properties attributed to all states by anarchists and others. Disputes arise between anarchists and those Marxists who believe that a state is required for the repression of classes other than the working class. In example, Bakunin wrote in his work ""Anarchism and the State"": Bakunin believed that Marx's desire to abolish the state and create, in the last analysis, an anarchist system via state power is irrational. Commenting on that he added that ""anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, Marxists in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved."" Marx replied to Bakhunin's criticisms by jotting marginal notes in his copy of Anarchism and the State. The process of transition. The theory of the state leads directly into the practical question of what form the transition to the stateless society both anarchists and Marxists view as their end goal will take. Marxists believe that a successful transition to a stateless society communism will require the repression of capitalists in order for them not to re-establish their control. That requires, according to Marxists, the existence of a state in some form run by workers (there is a dispute on whether the dictatorship of the proletariat is a state as we conceive it today). This formulation can be gross, envisaging the dictatorship of the proletariat as a political dictatorship; or, it can be nuanced, seeing the dictatorship of the proletariat as an internally democratic amongst workers. The kind of workers' state envisaged varies between the bureaucratic apparatus and internally undemocratic state departments and armed forces of capitalist states through to internally democratic and anti-bureaucratic structures such as workers councils. Anarchists and some libertarian socialists reject the Marxist view that a transitional phase will be needed and accuse Marxism of being too authoritarian, though they have been much less critical of Libertarian varieties of Marxism than scientific communism, Leninism and Stalinism. Anarchists contend that the ""workers' state"" advocated by Marxists is a logical impossibility since, as soon as a group -be it the workers- begins to govern by means of a state apparatus, they gain power and become oppressors. It is important to note however that this argument is a misrepresentation in that it uses the Anarchist definition of the state and not that of the Marxists, ascribing to the ""workers state"", characteristics which the Marxists do not necessarily imply by the word ""state"". The idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat has been criticized by most anarchists both on a theoretical and historical basis. Mainly, it is argued that it is not a class that takes power but at best a minority of that class, a party in the Leninist sense, and so is a dictatorship over the proletariat. They point to the measures taken by Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin during the Russian Revolution since as early as 1917 as evidence of this. Anarchists support their arguments by pointing to the undemocratic nature of the Soviet Union and other self-identified ""Marxist"" states. Some Marxists criticise the immediatist anarchist position by arguing that any revolutionary institution using armed force is acting as a state, regardless of its name or self-conception. Other Marxists argue for the necessity of a strong and cohesive repressive institution during revolutions, and support this position by pointing to the defeat of anarchist-led revolutions such as that during the Spanish Civil War, or other revolutions which were defeated. Therefore, both Marxists and anarchists wish to abolish the existing state. Immediately after abolishing the existing state, Marxists seek to replace it with a workers' state, i.e. the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"", or the workers organized as the ruling class. From this point, as expressed by Frederick Engels, the worker's state will begin to wither away, finally ceasing to exist when class antagonisms have been defeated. On the other hand, anarchists feel the re-creation of any sort of state will place power in the hand of a tiny minority, that States with their repressive capacities and massive bureaucracies tend to be self-perpetuating and do not ""wither away"", and that in practice establishing a new state is thus counter-revolutionary because in order to eventually eliminate it a second revolution will be required. Anarchists point to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demands by grassroots movements throughout the Soviet block to abolish the dictatorship but keep socialism as a failed attempt to make such a second revolution. The failure of such movements as they were co-opted by former Soviet leaders (nomenklatura) who instead kept the dictatorship and abolished socialism, is seen as evidence that such a long and circuitous route from capitalism to freedom is inefficient and unlikely to actually result in freedom. Marxists respond to this saying that the organized, centralized repression of the capitalist class will be absolutely necessary, and that the proletariat can only accomplish this by the use of the state. The Marxist position blends into anarchism at one end of the spectrum, mostly due to the wide variety of Marxist and Anarchist movements. The anarchists disagree among themselves if a system of democratic workers' councils constitutes a state or not, while on the other hand Marxists disagree widely among themselves over the form and the existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Political parties. The issue of seizing state power brings up the issue of political parties, which also divides anarchists and Marxists. Most Marxists see political parties as useful or even necessary tools for seizing state power, since they view a centrally coordinated effort as necessary to successfully defeat the capitalist class and state and establish a body capable of maintaining power. However, Marxists disagree on whether a revolutionary party ought to participate in bourgeois elections, what role it should have after a revolution, and how it should be organized. Anarchists generally refuse to participate in governments, and so do not form parliamentary political parties. However, the organisations formed by anarchists have either been political federations, such as the FAI, or often resemble the non-parliamentary roles of a political party by having a shared membership, set of principles, platform for action and media such as newspapers. Many of these organisations have been characterised by attempts at direct democracy, federalism or participatory democracy. When anarchist organisations have been pushed by historical circumstances, such as the controversy over the CNT-FAI's participation in the Spanish Popular Front, some anarchist organisations have acted as representative or commanding organisations. Marxists often point to the irony of this situation, and use it to argue in favour of a more honest approach to the relationship between party, or party like organisation, and the rest of the working class. Violence and revolution. Another practical question closely related to the theory of the state is whether and how much violence is acceptable in order to achieve a successful revolution. Some anarchist trends rely more on propaganda of the deed, actions they perceive as inspirational to the working class. Marxists and many anarchists believe that violent revolution is necessary or inevitable. Such anarchists often believe the anarchist revolution will be a spontaneous, unorganized uprising, while Marxists and anarcho-syndicalists believe that the bourgeoisie will inevitably use violence against the organized workers' movement. On the other hand, some anarchists promote self-defense rather than large-scale anti-state violence. Some promote non-violent protests, marches, and general strikes, only condoning violence in self-defense against aggressive actions taken by the state to prevent non-violent anarchist revolutions. Some view force as inherently authoritarian. Indeed, this was an argument made by Karl Marx against the logic of anarchism as promoted by Mikhail Bakunin. Many social, individualist and mutualist anarchists however sometimes prefer reformist approaches rather than open violence and would only advocate such under extreme circumstances. Arguments surrounding the issue of class. Both Marxist and socialist anarchist class analyses are based on the idea that society is divided into ""classes"", which are created based on the control each class has upon the means of production and hence each class having differing interests. The two differ, however, in where they draw the lines between these groups. Anarcho-primitivists and post-left anarchists reject left wing politics in general (and theoretically by extension Marxist class analysis) as they typically see left wing politics as corrupt and in the former case see civilization as unreformable. For Marxists, the two most relevant classes are the ""bourgeoisie"", those who own the means of production, and the ""proletariat"", more explicitly, the wage laborers. Marx believed that the industrial workers -and only them- would organize together, abolish the state, take control over the means of production, collectivize them, and create a classless society administered by and for workers. He believed that only the workers have the motive and power to do that. For this reason, he dismissed peasants,the ""petty-bourgeois"", and the ""lumpen-proletariat""—the unemployed ""underclass""—as incapable of creating revolution. The anarchist class analysis predates Marxism and contradicts it. Anarchists argue that it is not the whole bourgeoisie who has control over the means of production and the state, but only a minority of them, which is part of the ruling class, but has its own concerns. Also, traditionally anarchists have rejected Marx's dismissal of the lumpen proletariat and the peasantry as revolutionary and argued that a revolution, in order to be successful, needs the support of the peasants. Classical Anarchists believed that this is only possible through the redistribution of land. That is, they explicitly reject imposing state property of the land, although voluntary collectivization is seen as more efficient and thus supported (indeed, during the Spanish revolution anarchists impulsed hundreds of collectivizations but only a tiny minority had all the land in the area, small peasants were allowed to cultivate their own land without hired labour). Some modern anarchists (particularly pareconists) argue that there are three ""classes"", which have relevance to social change—not two. The first is the labor class (which includes everyone whose labor is involved in producing and distributing goods as well as much of the so-called ""service"" industry). This includes farmers, peasants, industrial workers, small landowners, small business owners who labor with their employees and blue, pink and white-collar workers. The second is the coordinator class which includes everyone whose labor is primarily concerned with ""coordinating"" and managing the labor of others primarily on behalf of the bourgeoisie, administrating organizations, setting the intellectual status quo or managing the State apparatus. The anarchist definition of the ""coordinator class"" includes people such as bureaucrats, technocrats, managers, administrators, middle-class intellectuals (such as economists, political and social scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, etc.), physical scientists, judges, lawyers, military officials, political party organizers and leaders, etc. And finally the elite owning class or ""capital class"" which derives its income from its control of wealth, land, property and resources. Marxists vigorously debate the exact composition of the middle class under capitalism. Some also describe a ""co-ordinating class"" which implements capitalism on behalf of the capitalists, composed of the petit bourgeoisie, professionals and managers. Others dispute this, freely using the term ""middle class"" to refer to affluent white-collar workers as described above (even though, in Marxist terms, they are part of the proletariat—the working class). Still others (for example, Council communists) allege, like anarchists, that there is a class comprising intellectuals, technocrats and managers which seeks power in its own right. This last group of communists allege that such technocratic middle classes seized power and government for themselves in Soviet-style societies. Anarchists contend that Marxism fails, and will always fail, because it creates a dictatorship of the coordinating technocratic/managerial class and that a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" is a logical impossibility. Mikhail Bakunin foreshadowed this argument when he wrote: Some believe that Marxism fails because its theoretical ""socialist mode of production"" involves centralizing and empowering the State apparatus which empowers people from the coordinator class to seize control of the State and means of production to manage the labor class, effectively acting as a surrogate capital class. However, this is less of a problem for libertarian Marxists who believe that such as State apparatus should operate on working class-led participatory democracy or even as a consociational state. Key differences thus include the fact that Anarchists do not differentiate between peasants, lumpen, and proletarians and instead define all people who work for the profit of others as members of the working class, regardless of occupation; and that anarchists do differentiate between the economic and political elites who set policy and the business and government functionaries that carry those policies out whereas Marxists lump the two together. Further, some Anarchists argue that Marxism fails because it springs from the minds of middle class intellectuals, while arguing that anarchism springs spontaneously from the self-activity and self-organization of the labor class. They point to the fact that the major schools of Marxism are often named after the intellectuals who formed the movements through high analytical and philosophical praxis theorization. While schools of Anarchism tend to emerge from organizational principles or forms of practice and are rarely (if ever) named after or centered around an individual intellectual. Anarchists distinguish themselves by what they do, and how they organize themselves whereas Marxists tend to distinguish themselves by their strategic approach and their philosophical or intellectual methodology. Marxists, however, contend that their ideas are not new ideologies which sprang from intellectuals but are ideas which form from the class contradictions of each economic and social mode of history. They argue that Marxian socialism in particular arose from the minds of the working class due to the class contradictions of the capitalist mode of production. Some Marxists even argue that anarchism springs from the ideas of proletarians (or even petty bourgeoisie) who have been marginalized by capitalism as an unorganized and unrefined reactionary struggle against the forces of capitalism. Other axes of oppression. The Marxist analysis of class struggles and of power as the cause of injustice has consequences on how Marxists relate themselves to the liberation movements of groups such as women, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and cultural minorities (such as homosexuals). Classical Marxism generally dismissed such movements since, for Marxists, class struggle had to take precedence over all other forms of struggle. They argued that only the class struggle could allow the working class to seize power via seizing the state. Once state power had been seized, issues like racism or sexism, could be much more easily dealt with. Since the 1970s, however, most Marxist organizations explicitly support such liberation movements, not only because they are worthy in and of themselves, but also on the grounds that they are seen as necessary for a working-class revolution. Many Marxists believe that attempts by oppressed people to liberate themselves will continue to fail to achieve their full aims until class society is done away with, because under capitalism and other class societies, social power rests at the point of production.  Anarchists, other political movements and a lot of theorists criticize classical Marxism for giving class priority and argue that this way of explaining social movements denigrates other oppressions, which operate with their own independent dynamics. Most Anarchists see liberation movements by oppressed people as fundamentally legitimate, be they ""peasants"", ""proletarians"", or bourgeoisie, without needing to fit these movements into a predetermined schema for revolution. However, many anarchists believe that single issue struggles are extremely limited and not powerful enough to change in depth societal conditions. Nevertheless, they still support and participate in them since they still think of them as useful. Marxists tend to view people as sharing a certain class consciousness based on their station in capitalist society. They believe that people share a collective socio-economic mindset and that freedom comes from liberating the class of its class status shackles, thus eventually empowering the individual. Anarchists on the other hand tend to view people as social individuals who share a common condition in capitalist society, but don't necessarily share a uniform class consciousness. Religion. Religion is another area of disagreement amongst anarchists and Marxists. Marx in the Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right described religion as the instrument of the bourgeois class to easily dominate the minds of the proletariat and inspire subservience to authority and acceptance of the status quo in return for future reward in the after death 'life'. Most Marxists tend to envision a ""pure communism"" as being free of religion, sometimes promoting violence against clergy and religious institutions. Nonetheless, religious marxists exist all over the world. Despite the hostility of Marxism to organized religion, there have been attempts to fuse the two, Liberation theology being the most obvious example. Some Priests associated with Liberation Theology have even joined and fought with armed guerrillas, Camilo Torres, for instance, joined and fought with the ELN (National Liberation Army) in Colombia and died in combat. Although the Vatican has actively condemned liberation theology, liberation theology remains influential in parts of Latin America, most notably with the Landless Workers' Movement of Brazil. Anarchists advocate resistance to oppressive and authoritarian institutions, including religious ones; and in extreme cases this may include violent resistance. During the Spanish Civil War, for instance, the Catholic Church was one of the biggest landowners and allied itself with the Falangist Fascist movement led by Francisco Franco. Opposition to Catholic institutions and the collectivization of church lands by peasants formed a major part of the anarchist revolution that opposed Franco in Barcelona. In the Basque Country, however, most priests defied the church and opposed Fascism and urged their congregations to do likewise, and so on the ground there was little in the way of physical conflict between anarchists and Catholics over religion. In contrast to Marxism, anarchism has historically been more accepting of personal spirituality and egalitarian religions. Anarchism has also historically gained much more support amongst religious communities and at various times and places explicitly anarchist forms of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions have claimed tens of thousands of members. Some anarchists envision future society as being free of religion while others envision a future society in which egalitarian religions and spirituality being a private matter equally tolerated with non-religious tendencies in a neutral, secular society. A smaller number envision spirituality or egalitarian religions playing a prominent role in society, most recently Neopaganism, with its focus on the sanctity of nature and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has led to a number of Neopagan inspired anarchists. One of the most prominent is Starhawk, who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism. Nationalism and relationships with indigenous peoples and stateless nations. Anarchism and Marxism differ in their relationships with Indigenous peoples and national minorities. The classical Anarchist position was that the coming revolution would wipe away all distinctions of nationality, since nationality is socially constructed, that the proletariat has no ""nation"", and that the natural form for socialism was internationalism. This remained the established position of the entire anti-capitalist left up until the early 1900s and still holds considerable sway in both anarchist and Marxist circles. Marxists acknowledge boundaries and development of the nation state. During the build-up to the Russian revolution, however, Lenin and the Bolsheviks found it expedient to promise independence to the various indigenous non-Russian national minorities, notably the Ukrainians and the Poles, in return for their support against the Czarist empire. Whilst some Bolsheviks continued to support this position, the dominant Bolshevik faction grouped around Lenin in Moscow first drove the National Communists underground and the liquidating them in 1928. Subsequently all nationalist movements throughout the USSR were brutally crushed by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and all their successors until the collapse of the USSR as a political unit. In the run-up to World War II Russia's foreign policy centered around the idea of National Bolshevism, through which the Bolshevik political elite in Russia sought to instigate and support communist-nationalist revolutions around the world, most notably in Hungary and Germany, and then absorb the newly independent areas into a Soviet commonwealth—a goal that was achieved after World War II with the Warsaw Pact. Elements of this persisted in Soviet foreign policy throughout the cold war and helped motivate support of nationalist and anti-imperialist movements throughout the third world. Aid by Russia to the Chinese Communist Party during the Chinese revolution was driven by the same motivation, but once in power Mao refused to allow the USSR to control Chinese policy, leading to a break with Stalin that culminated in a brief war between the two powers. The same process would later play out in the relationship between Communist rulers in China and Vietnam. During the Chinese revolution a parallel process occurred as Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party first promised independence and self-determination to all of China's many stateless nations, and then not only refused to deliver once the CCP's grip on power was solidified but actually invaded and annexed Tibet, which he regarded as a renegade province. Every successive Communist government throughout the world has followed this same pattern of first promising indigenous national minorities self-determination in order to gain their support and then actively opposing that self-determination once in power. In a nutshell, the general policy of Marxist governments from Lenin on has been to support revolution nationalism and the rights of indigenous groups in theory and to oppose it in practice. Most recently, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua were accused of carrying out campaigns of ethnic cleansing against indigenous peoples in order to seize their land.  Ward Churchill has gone so far as to argue in his essay on Marxism and Indigenism that Marxism is inherently imperialist and racist in effect, if not in intent, because it is based on the idea of historical progress and industrialization as inevitable, and sees industrial proletarian-based societies as more ""advanced"" than other societies (particularly indigenous societies). Other scholars argue that the conflict has to do with the demands of running a State structure and argue that if the Bolsheviks had come to power in Poland (for example) instead of Russia they would have had to become Polish nationalists and would have bitterly opposed Russian attempts to dominate Poland. Seizing the Russian State, however, meant that they had to defend the interests of that State; and the rights of stateless nations thus became anathema.  The position of Anarchism is somewhat the reverse. Most Anarchists, both historically and up to the present day, see borders and national divisions as detrimental and envision a world in which distinctions of race and ethnicity fade and disappear over time as the ideal. In practice, however, Anarchism is based on small-scale systems of self-determination, local self-governance, and mutual aid that fulfill the desire of national minorities for self-determination on a defacto basis; and has thus been historically compatible with anti-state forms of nationalism. The most notable collaboration, of course, being the movements for self-rule by the Catalans and Basques in Spain which found expression under the banner of the anarchist CNT during the Spanish Civil War. More recently there has been an attempt at an explicit fusion of Anarchism and native-American political traditions manifested in the modern Indigenist movement. Anti-State nationalist organizations that explicitly describe their politics as Anarchist currently exist in Ireland and Brittany. Many members of the modern American Indian Movement also consider themselves Anarchists. Methodological disagreements. Marxism uses a form of analysis of human societies called ""historical materialism."" The central idea of historical materialism is the idea that people live in a determined material world, and act in order to produce changes upon this predetermined world, without being able to fundamentally change it. In economic terms, the relations of production are the driving force of history. Underlying these processes, as a dialectical background notion, is the idea that contradictions and opposed social groups are the ones that form and drive social progress. Marx formulated the concept of historical materialism from a critique of Hegel's Idealism and dialectics. Marx only applied historical materialism to human history; however, Marxists claim that his methodology can be applied to all phenomena and they usually describe it as dialectical materialism. Anarchist philosopher Murray Bookchin developed dialectical naturalism out of a combination of Marxist and Hegelian dialectics, and Kropotkin's biological outlook. Classical Anarchists saw value in historical materialism as a tool for social analysis. Contemporary anarchists use a wide variety of tools of social analysis, historical materialism included. The Irish Workers Solidarity Movement, for instance, makes agreeing with the historical materialist method's value a central point of unity. Many anarchists, however, dismiss dialectical materialism as a pseudo-science based on untestable and unfalsifiable universal claims. Anarchists were among the first to criticise the dialectical materialist trend as pseudo-science and generally criticised either the Marxist methodologies as such, or the applications of them, on the basis that both historical and dialectical materialism dehumanise people as the agents of history. Within Marxism these criticisms are mirrored by the criticisms of socialist humanists, Western Marxists, Autonomist Marxists and other similar thinkers. Determinism. A simple interpretation of historical materialism suggests that if Marxism is right about the class forces operating in capitalism, a successful working-class revolution is inevitable. Some Marxists, notably the leaders of the Second International in the late 19th and early 20th century, have believed this. However, the degree to which the revolution must be made by conscious forces has always been a matter of dispute among Marxists, with many arguing that Marx' famous statement that ""I am not a Marxist"" was a rejection of determinism, and the split was sharpened by the First World War, when the social democratic parties of the Second International supported their respective nations' war efforts. Many Marxist opponents of the war, such as Rosa Luxemburg, blamed the Second International's ""betrayal"" partly on its doctrine of the inevitability of socialism, which justified its attempt to reform existing capitalist states. Luxemburg put the alternatives for the future, instead, as ""socialism or barbarism."" Since an influential segment of anarchists reject either dialectical materialism or historical materialism or both, these anarchists usually do not claim that revolution and the reorganization of society are inevitable, only that they are desirable. Some anarchists, while rejecting dialetical or historical materialism claim other bases for the inevitability of revolution, such as the natural yearning of consciousness for freedom; these anarchists find their mirror within Marxist intellectual movements in individuals such as Herbert Marcuse.

wikipedia-381805," Franck–Hertz experiment  The Franck–Hertz experiment was a physics experiment that provided support for the Bohr model of the atom, a precursor to quantum mechanics. In 1914, the German physicists James Franck and Gustav Ludwig Hertz sought to experimentally probe the energy levels of the atom. The now-famous Franck–Hertz experiment elegantly supported Niels Bohr's model of the atom, with electrons orbiting the nucleus with specific, discrete energies. Franck and Hertz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925 for this work. The Franck–Hertz experiment confirmed Bohr's quantized model of the atom by demonstrating that atoms could indeed only absorb (and be excited by) specific amounts of energy (quanta). The experiment. The classic experiment involved a tube containing low pressure gas fitted with three electrodes: an electron-emitting cathode, atwo mesh grid for acceleration, and an anode. The anode was held at a slightly negative electrical potential relative to the grid (although positive compared to the cathode), so that electrons had to have at least a corresponding amount of kinetic energy to reach it after passing the grid. Instruments were fitted to measure the current passing between the electrodes, and to adjust the potential difference (voltage) between the cathode (negative electrode) and the accelerating grid. Interpretation of results. Franck and Hertz were able to explain their experiment in terms of elastic and inelastic collisions. At low potentials, the accelerated electrons acquired only a modest amount of kinetic energy. When they encountered mercury atoms in the tube, they participated in purely elastic collisions. This is due to the prediction of quantum mechanics that an atom can absorb no energy until the collision energy exceeds that required to lift an electron into a higher energy state. With purely elastic collisions, the total amount of kinetic energy in the system remains the same. Since electrons are over one thousand times less massive than even the lightest atoms, this meant that the electrons held on to the vast majority of that kinetic energy. Higher potentials served to drive more electrons through the grid to the anode and increase the observed current, until the accelerating potential reached 4.9 volts. The lowest energy electronic excitation a mercury atom can participate in requires 4.9 electron volts (eV). When the accelerating potential reached 4.9 volts, each free electron possessed exactly 4.9 eV of kinetic energy (above its rest energy at that temperature) when it reached the grid. Consequently, a collision between a mercury atom and a free electron at that point could be inelastic: that is, a free electron's kinetic energy could be converted into potential energy by raising the energy level of an electron bound to a mercury atom: this is called exciting the mercury atom. With the loss of all its acquired kinetic energy in this way, the free electron can no longer overcome the slight negative potential at the ground electrode, and the measured current drops sharply. As the voltage is increased, electrons will participate in one inelastic collision, lose their 4.9 eV, but then continue to be accelerated. In this manner, the current rises again after the accelerating potential exceeds 4.9 V. At 9.8 V, the situation changes again. There, each electron now has just enough energy to participate in ""two"" inelastic collisions, excite two mercury atoms, and then be left with no kinetic energy. Once again, the observed current drops. At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional inelastic collision. New findings of this experiment have found that the spacing between minima and maxima increase with number of minima and vary with temperature. Refer to for more information. Effect in other gases. A similar pattern is observed with neon gas, but at intervals of approximately 19 volts. The process is identical, just with a much different threshold. One additional difference is that a glow will appear near the accelerating grid at 19 volts—one of the transitions of relaxing neon atoms emits red-orange light. This glow will move closer to the cathode with increasing accelerating potential, to whatever point in the tube the electrons acquire the 19 eV required to excite a neon atom. At 38 volts two distinct glows will be visible: one between the cathode and grid, and one right at the accelerating grid. Higher potentials, spaced at 19 volt intervals, will result in additional glowing regions in the tube. "
wikipedia-381810," Lagaan  Lagaan (""Land Tax"") is a 2001 Indian epic sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. Aamir Khan, who was also the producer, stars with Gracy Singh in the lead roles; British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne play the supporting roles. Made on a budget of , the film was shot in an ancient village near Bhuj, India. The film is set in the Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj and revolves around the peasants from a barren village who are oppressed by high taxes imposed by their rulers. They attempt to persuade the British officers to reduce the taxes because of poor agricultural production. Instead, a wager is offered: If their village team beats a British team in a game of cricket, their taxes for three years would be cancelled. After accepting this wager, the villagers face the arduous task of learning an alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny. ""Lagaan"" received critical acclaim and awards at international film festivals, as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after ""Mother India"" (1957) and ""Salaam Bombay!"" (1988). It was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001. In 2010, the film was ranked No. 55 in ""Empire"" magazines ""The 100 Best Films of World Cinema"". In 2011, it was listed in ""Time"" magazine's special ""The All-TIME 25 Best Sports Movies"". Plot. ""Lagaan"" takes place in the small village of Champaner, now in the State of Gujarat, in western India during the height of the British Empire in India in 1893. Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the commanding officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes (""lagaan"") on people from the local villages which they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that much to his regret, he is also bound by British law. It is after their visit to the Raja that the people of the village first witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into a fight with one of the British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province for three years if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times the amount of their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on the behalf of all villages without their consent. When the other villagers find out about the bet, they are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule. Bhuvan thus begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the people in the villages. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is also in love with Gauri. In an attempt to discredit Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villager's team to destroy it. Eventually, as the villagers realise that winning equals freedom, and as a few of them are insulted by the British, they join the team. Still short one player, Bhuvan also invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl leg spin. The villagers, conditioned by long term prejudice against untouchables, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, leading them to accept Kachra. The second half of the film focuses on the match itself. On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has lost his ability to spin the ball, because new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones like the team had been practising with. In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. During the evening, however, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself. The next day as part of his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick which sparks the British batting collapse. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, while Deva was backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit by a bouncer on his head, and he falls on to his stumps. Other batsmen get out trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on his leg. The villager's team ends the day with 4 batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board. On the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the required runs to a gettable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down 5 runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing only a single. However, the umpire signals no ball and Bhuvan returns to bat, and swings extremely hard at the next ball. Captain Russell backpedals and catches the ball, leading him to believe the British team has won. However, Russell caught the ball beyond the boundary which gives 6 runs, and the win, to Bhuvan's team. At that moment, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts. Bhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the humiliated cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realising that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. Bhuvan marries Gauri. Production. Origins. Director Ashutosh Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make ""Lagaan"". He first put forth the idea to Shahrukh Khan who was not able to do the film and recommended Aamir Khan. Gowariker then went to Aamir, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Even after securing Khan, Ashutosh had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Aamir agreed to Ashutosh's suggestion that he'd produce the film. Aamir corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Ashutosh, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce ""Lagaan"". He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Ashutosh. He cited an example: ""If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them."" Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. Location, language and costumes. One of the first members to join the production team was Nitin Chandrakant Desai, the art director, with whom Ashutosh set out for extensive location hunt throughout India, to find the setting for the fictional town of Champaner, in late 1998. After searching through Rajasthan, Nasik, UP, they zeroed in on an ancient village near Bhuj, located in Gujarat's Kutch district, by May 1999, where the film was primarily shot. The script demanded a dry location: an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems at that time and hence the village of Kanuria, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of ""Lagaan"", it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating 2.5 lakhs, with further contributions during the year. Avadhi, which is a dialect of Hindi, is primarily from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give the feel of the language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted so that modern viewers could understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena. Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar winner for ""Gandhi"", was the costume designer for the film. With a large number of extras, it was difficult for her to make enough costumes. She spent a lot of time researching to lend authenticity to the characters. Filming. Pre-planning for a year, including ten months for production issues and two months for his character, was tiring for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly-constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era. During the shooting, Ashutosh suffered from a slipped disc and had to rest for 15 days. During this period, he had his bed next to the monitor and continued with his work. The filming schedule spanned across the winter and summer commencing early January and finishing in mid-June. This was physically challenging to many with the temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius. The actors had to drink frequently and sit in the shade. The schedule was strict. The day began at 6 am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example for the rest of the crew. ""If he started coming late, how could she tell the others to come on time?"" While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc. Release. Before its worldwide release, Aamir Khan kept a promise to screen the film to the locals of Bhuj. ""Lagaan"" clashed with Sunny Deol's """" at the box office. The film made it to the UK Top 10 after its commercial release. It was the first Indian film to have a nationwide release in China and had its dubbed version released in Italy. With favourable reviews from the French press, ""Lagaan"" premiered in Paris on 26 June 2002 and continued to have an unprecedented nine weeks of screening with over 45,000 people watching. It was released in the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Middle East with respective vernacular subtitles. The film garnered a cumulative of $2.5 million at the international box-office and Rs. 38 crores at the domestic box-office. In 2001, ""Lagaan"" had a world premiere at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) weekend in Sun City, South Africa. The Locarno International Film Festival authorities published the rules of cricket before the film was screened to a crowd which reportedly danced to its soundtrack in the aisles. ""Lagaan"" was shown four times due to public demand as against the usual norm of showcasing films once at the festival. It subsequently won the ""Prix du Public"" award at the festival. After the film's publicity in Locarno, the director, Ashutosh Gowarikar said that distributors from Switzerland, Italy, France, Netherlands, North Africa, Finland and Germany were wanting to purchase the distribution rights. Special screenings were held in Russia, where people were keen to watch the film after its Oscar nomination. Apart from these screenings, it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, Cairo International Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, Helsinki Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Reception. ""Lagaan"" was met with high critical acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% ""Certified Fresh"" approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, """"Lagaan"" is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals."" Derek Elley of ""Variety"" suggested that it ""could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets"". Somni Sengupta of ""The New York Times"", described it as ""a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines"" Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, """"Lagaan"" is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. ""Lagaan"" is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture."" Peter Bradshaw of ""The Guardian"" described the film as ""a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling."" Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that """"Lagaan"" is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile."" Kevin Thomas of the ""Los Angeles Times"" argued that the film is ""an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view."" Sudish Kamath of ""The Hindu"" suggested that ""the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be."" ""The Times of India"" wrote, """"Lagaan"" has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping."" Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the ""Trenton Independent"", who wrote ""a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film."" ""Lagaan"" was listed as number 14 on Channel 4's ""50 Films to See Before you Die"" and was the only Indian film to be listed. Awards. Aamir Khan and Gowariker went to Los Angeles to generate publicity for the Academy Awards. Khan said, ""We just started showing it to whoever we could, even the hotel staff."" About India's official entry to the 2002 Oscars, The Daily Telegraph wrote, ""A Bollywood film that portrays the British in India as ruthless sadists and Mafia-style crooks has been chosen as Delhi's official entry to the Academy Awards."" It added that the film was expected to win the nomination. On 12 February 2002, ""Lagaan"" was nominated for the best foreign language film at the Academy Award nominations ceremony. After the nomination, Khan reacted by saying, ""To see the name of the film and actually hear it being nominated was very satisfying"". Post-nomination reactions poured in from several parts of the world. The USA Today wrote ""Hooray for Bollywood, and India's ""Lagaan"""". With Sony Pictures Classics distributing the film and Oscar-winning director Baz Luhrmann praising it, ""Lagaan"" had a chance to win. The ""BBC"" commented that the nomination raised Bollywood hopes that Indian films would become more popular in the US. In India, the nomination was celebrated with news reports about a win bringing in ""a great boost for the Indian film industry"" and ""a Bharat Ratna for Aamir Khan and the status of a 'national film' for Lagaan"". When ""Lagaan"" lost the award to the Bosnian film ""No Man's Land"", there was disappointment in India. Khan said, ""Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us."" Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt criticised the ""American film industry"" as ""insular and the foreign category awards were given just for the sake of it."" Gowarikar added that ""Americans must learn to like our films"". The film won a number of national awards including eight National Film Awards, nine Filmfare Awards, nine Screen Awards and ten IIFA Awards. Apart from these major awards, it also won awards at other national and international ceremonies. Soundtrack. The acclaimed soundtrack for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The ""Los Angeles Times"" said that the ""songs and dances are not mere interludes inserted in the action, bringing it to a halt—a Bollywood trademark—but are fully integrated into the plot and marked by expressive, dynamic singing and dancing that infuse a historical drama with energy and immediacy."" A review of the tracks suggests that ""the music is true to the time period (the British Raj)"". Another review said: ""A. R. Rahman is again at his prodigious best. His score for Aamir Khan’s period drama Lagaan is a delectable blend of Indian classical music, folk melodies and jazzy snazzy tunes."" The reviewer of ""Screen India"" said, ""Great music, heard after a long time, which elevates your senses. That Rahman's among the best is proved here."" The soundtrack was ranked No. 44 on Amazon.com's ""The 100 Greatest World Music Albums of All Time"". The soundtrack won 3 National Film Awards in three categories. A. R. Rahman won the award for the best music, Udit Narayan won the Best Male Playback Singer Award for ""Mitwa"" and Javed Akhtar won the Best Lyrics Award for ""Ghanan Ghanan"" and ""Radha Kaise Na Jale"". ""Lagaan"" also became the biggest audio hit of the year by topping the music charts and selling 3.5 million records within a year. Home media. There were two releases for the DVD. The first, as a 2-DVD set, was released on 27 May 2002 in limited regions. It contained subtitles in Arabic, English, Hebrew, Hindi, Turkish and several European languages. It is available in 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, progressive 24 frame/s, widescreen and NTSC format. It carried an additional fifteen minutes of deleted scenes, filmographies and trailers. The second was released as anniversary edition three-disc DVD box after six years of the theatrical release. This also included ""Chale Chalo"" which was a documentary on the making of Lagaan, a curtain raiser on the making of the soundtrack, deleted scenes, trailers, along with other collectibles.| After its release, it became the highest selling DVD in India beating ""Sholay"" (1975). Merchandise. In the anniversary DVD edition, a National Film Award-winning documentary, ""Chale Chalo – the lunacy of film making"", 11 collector cards, a collectible ""Lagaan"" coin embossed with the character of ""Bhuvan"", a 35 mm CinemaScope filmstrip hand-cut from the film's filmstrip were bundled with the film. A comic book, ""Lagaan: The Story"", along with two colouring books, a mask book and a cricket board game were subsequently released to the commercial market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted for children between the ages of six and 14. At the book's launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself. In March 2002, a book titled ""The Spirit of Lagaan – The Extraordinary Story of the Creators of a Classic"" was published. It covers the making of the film, describing in detail about the setbacks and obstacles that the crew faced while developing the film from concept to its release. "
wikipedia-381819," Kosrae  Kosrae , formerly known as Kusaie, is an island in Federated States of Micronesia. The State of Kosrae is one of four states of the Federated States of Micronesia, and includes the main island of Kosrae and about a dozen nearby islands and islets, the most significant of which is Lelu Island. Geography. With a population of 6,616 (2010 census), Kosrae is the most eastern of the Caroline Islands. The island is located approximately north of the equator, between Guam and the Hawaiian Islands. Its land area is approximately . Some parts of the island are experiencing coastal erosion. Kosrae is a high island that is largely unspoiled. Kosrae is becoming a destination for scuba divers and hikers. The coral reefs that surround the island are kept in pristine condition through an extensive mooring buoy system, installed and maintained by concerned expat dive operators with the help of the government's Marine Resources office. The reefs are seldom visited, and contain miles of hard corals, some said to be thousands of years old. Dense vegetation and steep mountains keep the island largely undeveloped. Viewed from the sea, the island's distinct shape resembles a female body. This has led to the island being called ""the island of the sleeping lady."" Kosrae International Airport (IATA code KSA) is located on an artificial island within the fringing reef about 150 meters from the coast and is connected to the main island by a causeway. It is served by United Air Lines (formerly Continental Micronesia) ""Island Hopper"" flights (twice a week in each direction) between Hawaii and Guam, stopping at other FSM and Marshallese destinations on the way. There is one significant nearshore island within the fringing reef around Kosrae, which is Lelu Island, and it is only in area, but with a population of around 1,500. It belongs to Lelu municipality, which includes the area around Tofol, the state capital. Other very small, uninhabited islands within the fringing reef are, Yen Yen and Yenasr (also in Lelu municipality), the airport island, Kiul, Mutunyal, Sroansak (Tafunsak municipality), and Srukames (also Tafunsak municipality, Walung part). Education. The Kosrae Department of Education operates six public elementary schools (Tafunsak Elementary School, Malem Elementary School, Utwe Elementary School, Lelu Elementary School, Sansrik Elementary School, Walung Elementary School) and one high school (Kosrae High School). There is also one private school (Kosrae Seventh-day Adventist School).  In July 2011, Kosrae DOE embraced the One Laptop per Child programme, distributing 720 ""XO"" computers to children in its public elementary schools, becoming the first State of Micronesia to do so. Languages. The official language of Kosrae is Kosraean, although the English language may also be used in government discourse. According to the Constitution of Kosrae, English is held to have ""equal authority"" to Kosraean (although in an instance where the Kosraean and English versions of the Constitution are held to be in irresolvable conflict, the Kosraean version prevails) History. Archaeological evidence shows that the island was settled at least by the early years of the first millennium AD. This includes the city of Leluh that existed from about 1250 AD, and in its heyday had a population of about 1,500 and covered some 27 hectares. It featured burial pyramids for the nobility. First recorded sighting by Westerners was by the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on 14 September 1529 when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. The island was under nominal Spanish sovereignty since 1668, but it was not effectively occupied until 1885. By the time of the island's first contact with European travellers in 1824, Kosrae had a highly stratified society, typical of the surrounding islands of the time. Its cultural features included matrilineal lineage and clans, with a feudal structure of ""nobles"" controlling land worked by ""commoners"" and settlements consisting of small groups of close relatives sharing a single cook house. The first missionary post was established by Congregationalists in 1852, and virtually the whole island had converted to Christianity by the 1870s. Today, many sects of Christianity are represented on Kosrae, and religion still plays an integral role in culture. The pirate Bully Hayes was shipwrecked on Kosrae on March 15, 1874, when his ship the ""Leonora"" was caught in Lelu harbor during a storm. Bully Hayes made his home in Utwe for seven months, during which he terrorized the local people.  In September 1874, ""HMS Rosario"" (under the command of Captain Dupuis) arrived to investigate the claims against Hayes. He was arrested, but then escaped in a 14 foot boat, built of timber from the wreck of the ""Leonora"". His treasure may have been left behind, buried somewhere in the forest, although subsequent diggings have failed to uncover it. In 1885, after a dispute between the Spanish Empire and the German Empire, finally resolved under the terms of the Vatican State, the Spanish Navy took effective control of the island. After the Spanish defeat against the United States in the war of 1898, on February the 2nd 1899 Spain sold the Carolinas Islands to Germany for 25 million pesetas (17 million German marks). The island came under the control of the Empire of Japan after World War I. Extensive economic improvements took place during the Japanese South Pacific Mandate of 1914 to 1945. The island was practically run by a few missionaries who converted the population; Willard Price, when he visited in the 1930s, reported that the island had no jail, there had been no murders there in sixty years, and alcohol and tobacco were unheard of. The island was fortified by the Japanese during World War II, but no battles occurred on Kosrae. The Japanese garrison commanded by Lieutenant-General Yoshikazu Harada consisted of 3,811 IJA men including a company of tanks and 700 IJA men. Tunnel bunkers were dug into the tops of some of the island's interior peaks and some are still intact. In 1945, administration over Kosrae passed to the United States, which ruled the island as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Aid and investment increased from the 1960s. During the Trust Territory (TTPI) period, Kosrae was initially administered as one of the municipalities of the Ponape (Pohnpei) District, but in 1977 became a separate district. When the Micronesian constitution was defeated in the TTPI districts of Palau and the Marshall Islands, Kosrae joined the remaining districts (Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei) to form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Kosrae is the only one-island FSM state (whereby the seven or eight small nearshore islands within the fringing reef, most importantly Lelu Island, are subsumed under the main island), while the other three states are each composed of many islands. Until 1977, Kosrae was subdivided into districts or villages at the sub-municipality level: By 1980, five municipalities had been created from the former villages or districts: The number of municipalities has subsequently been reduced to four (by integrating Walung into Tafunsak). Economy. In early times, a system of exchange based on sea shells existed on Kosrae, although little is currently known about how it operated. Since the 1960s, the Kosraean government has become the main employer on the island, where fishing and traditional farming remain the main source of the islanders' subsistence. Imports have replaced almost all other native manufactures. The U.S dollar is the official currency used in Kosrae and throughout Micronesia. There is a small tourism industry, mainly centered around scuba diving on the coral reef that rings the island. Food. Traditional foods included breadfruit, coconut, banana, taro, yam, and sugarcane. Breadfruit was the usual staple food, and it was preserved in leaf-lined pits for times of scarcity. Coconuts were reserved for nobles. Food was a central part of island life, since each settlement consisted of small family groups gathered around a cook house containing at least one earth oven. Soft taro was made into a feast food called ""fahfah"" by men trained in the elaborate skills needed to prepare it properly, who also prepared suhka (Kava). Brewed from the roots of a mountain plant, Suhka was served to members of the nobility. Fish were harvested mainly from the lagoon using nets. Daily food for most families today consists of imported rice, tinned meats and fish, combined with fresh local fish and root crops. Even today, ""fahfah"" and pork are considered mainly feast foods. It is thought that the Japanese introduced limes to the island, which now bear fruit almost all year round and are of the highest quality. Tangerines, which are green when ripe, also abound, and are famous and sought after throughout the surrounding islands. Mountain apples, a tropical tree fruit unrelated to apples (Malus) are grown in many parts of Kosrae. There are many varieties of bananas, even some that must be cooked before eating and some could be eaten when still greenish (KALIFORNI). Few vegetables are grown on the island despite the favorable climate, in part because seeds are difficult to obtain. Although some state there are no pollinating insects on Kosrae, bees, flies and ants are known to pollinate plants on the island. Municipalities. Kosrae State is subdivided into four municipalities. Of the originally five municipalities of 1980, Walung was subsequently absorbed by Tafunsak. The capital of the state is Tofol, in Lelu municipality. "
wikipedia-381834," Anne de Montmorency  Anne, duc de Montmorency, Honorary Knight of the Garter (15 March 1493, Chantilly, Oise – 12 November 1567, Paris) was a French soldier, statesman and diplomat. He became Marshal of France and Constable of France. Early life. Montmorency was born at Chantilly to the ancient Montmorency family. His father had a senior status in the household of the king Louis XII. As a young boy he was brought up with the future King Francis I and they became close. In 1512, aged 19, Montmorency fought at the Battle of Ravenna, and in 1514 his sister Louise de Montmorency married Gaspard I de Coligny, and their children included the admiral of France. Reign of Francis I. When the young king acceded to the throne in January 1515, Montmorency became an influential member of his court. When the king reasserted the French claim to Milan the same year, Montmorency followed his king into Italy and distinguished himself at Marignano. Montmorency was named captain of the Bastille in 1516 and became governor of Novara. In 1518 he was one of the hostages in England for Francis I's debt to Henry VIII for the city of Tournai. He returned to France to attend a short and unsuccessful peace conference between the French and the Holy Roman Empire in May 1519. The following year he was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold and afterwards had charge of diplomatic negotiations in England when relations between the two countries again began to sour. In August 1521, Montmorency helped to command the defence of Mézières against the Imperial German army. In the same year he commanded the Swiss in Italy. His troops were defeated in the Battle of La Bicocca on 27 April 1522, but he was made Marshal of France in recognition of his courage. Montmorency spent the next three years defending northern France against the English invasion of 1523. By that time England had allied with the Holy Roman Empire. In 1524 he again joined Francis I in a campaign to retake Milan. On 24 February 1525, an army of Italians, Spanish and Germans defeated the French at the Battle of Pavia and captured both de Montmorency and his king. Both were sent to Spain but Montmorency was released soon afterwards. He was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Madrid in 1526 and attended his king when he was exchanged for his two eldest sons. In 1530 he returned the king's sons to France. On 23 March 1526, Anne de Montmorency was named Grand Master of France charged with supervision of the royal household and the king's private service. In 1527 he married Madeleine, the daughter of René of Savoy. He supported the king's efforts to form an alliance against Charles V. He worked with Cardinal Wolsey to form an alliance between Francis I and Henry VIII in 1527. This led to a new war against the Holy Roman Empire that ended with the Peace of Cambrai. In 1536, Francis I invaded the Duchy of Savoy, against the advice of Montmorency, staking claim to the lands of the duchy but also to pressure Charles V to give Milan back to him. Charles V invaded Provence from Northern Italy in retaliation. Francis appointed Montmorency, who had now retired from the court, to be the governor of Languedoc, the lieutenant general in the southeast of France and they led the defence of Provence using scorched earth tactics. Montmorency evacuated Aix-en-Provence and concentrated his forces near Avignon. By the early autumn Charles V had been forced to retreat his army to Genoa and lift the siege of Marseille. Montmorency joined the king in Picardy and at the end of the Netherlands campaign marched to relieve Turin. He led the French troops in 1537 when they attacked Artois in the Netherlands and captured many towns before the ten-year truce. On 10 February 1538 the king made him Constable of France. Afterwards Montmorency begun to support peace with the Holy Roman Emperor, against the prevailing attitude of the court. He renewed negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire and encouraged the Pope Paul III to create a settlement. He managed to get the two kings to meet at Aigues-Mortes in July 1538. According to the deal he had brokered, Francis expected that Charles V would give Milan to one of Francis' sons as a sign of alliance, but Charles gave the title to his son Philip. This result was a diplomatic failure and de Montmorency fell out of royal favor. Francis I turned to his rivals Cardinal Tournon, Claude d'Annebault and his mistress Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, the Duchess of Étampes. Montmorency retired from court in June 1541. Having lost his post as a governor of Languedoc, he was forbidden to exercise his other offices. He continued to maintain correspondence with the prince Henry. Henry II. Montmorency did not return to public life until the accession of Henry II in March 1547. The new king gave him back all his former offices and dismissed the duchesse d'Étampes and her followers. In 1548 Montmorency crushed the insurrections in the southwest, particularly at Bordeaux. From 1549-50 Montmorency led the war in the Boulonnais, negotiating the treaty for the surrender of Boulogne on 24 March 1550. As a reward the king created him a duke and peer of France and in 1551 his barony was expanded into a duchy. Soon afterwards his armies fought in the northeast when the French army seized Metz, Toul and Verdun. Francis II. Montmorency's attempt to relieve St Quentin on 10 August 1557 led to his defeat and capture by Spanish Habsburg forces. He was not released until October 1558 at the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis. By this time the Guises had supplanted him and the 15-year-old king Francis II treated him with indifference. Montmorency had to give up his Great Master status to the Duke of Guise. However, his son was appointed marshal by way of indemnity. He himself retired to his estates. French Wars of Religion. On the accession of Charles IX in 1560 Montmorency again assumed his duties in the court. However, when the Protestant-minded House of Bourbon asserted influence over the young king, the Roman Catholic Montmorency left the court. In April 1561 he allied himself with Francis, Duke of Guise, his former enemy, and Jacques d'Albon, Marshal Saint-Andre to form the Triumvirate, an association for the defense of Catholicism. Montmorency played an important part in the war of 1562. He was captured early in the Battle of Dreux when the cavalry under him was routed. Montmorency's soldiers eventually won the battle, but it was one of the bloodiest of the 16th century. He helped negotiate the Treaty of Amboise on 19 March 1563. In 1567 the Huguenots agitated for a fairer settlement. Death. On 10 November 1567, aged 74, Montmorency led the royal army to victory at Saint-Denis, but was fatally wounded and died two days later. Children. His marriage produced twelve children: "
wikipedia-381842," OpenMP  OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran, on most processor architectures and operating systems, including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior. OpenMP is managed by the nonprofit technology consortium ""OpenMP Architecture Review Board"" (or ""OpenMP ARB""), jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors, including AMD, IBM, Intel, Cray, HP, Fujitsu, Nvidia, NEC, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Oracle Corporation, and more. OpenMP uses a portable, scalable model that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from the standard desktop computer to the supercomputer. An application built with the hybrid model of parallel programming can run on a computer cluster using both OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI), or more transparently through the use of OpenMP extensions for non-shared memory systems. Introduction. OpenMP is an implementation of multithreading, a method of parallelizing whereby a master ""thread"" (a series of instructions executed consecutively) ""forks"" a specified number of slave ""threads"" and a task is divided among them. The threads then run concurrently, with the runtime environment allocating threads to different processors. The section of code that is meant to run in parallel is marked accordingly, with a preprocessor directive that will cause the threads to form before the section is executed. Each thread has an ""id"" attached to it which can be obtained using a function (called codice_1). The thread id is an integer, and the master thread has an id of ""0"". After the execution of the parallelized code, the threads ""join"" back into the master thread, which continues onward to the end of the program. By default, each thread executes the parallelized section of code independently. ""Work-sharing constructs"" can be used to divide a task among the threads so that each thread executes its allocated part of the code. Both task parallelism and data parallelism can be achieved using OpenMP in this way. The runtime environment allocates threads to processors depending on usage, machine load and other factors. The number of threads can be assigned by the runtime environment based on environment variables or in code using functions. The OpenMP functions are included in a header file labelled ""omp.h"" in C/C++. History. The OpenMP Architecture Review Board (ARB) published its first API specifications, OpenMP for Fortran 1.0, in October 1997. October the following year they released the C/C++ standard. 2000 saw version 2.0 of the Fortran specifications with version 2.0 of the C/C++ specifications being released in 2002. Version 2.5 is a combined C/C++/Fortran specification that was released in 2005.  Version 3.0 was released in May 2008. Included in the new features in 3.0 is the concept of ""tasks"" and the ""task"" construct.  Version 3.1 of the OpenMP specification was released July 9, 2011. Version 4.0 of the specification was released in July 2013. It adds or improves the following features: support for accelerators; atomics; error handling; thread affinity; tasking extensions; user defined reduction; SIMD support; Fortran 2003 support. The core elements. The core elements of OpenMP are the constructs for thread creation, workload distribution (work sharing), data-environment management, thread synchronization, user-level runtime routines and environment variables. In C/C++, OpenMP uses #pragmas. The OpenMP specific pragmas are listed below. Thread creation. The pragma ""omp parallel"" is used to fork additional threads to carry out the work enclosed in the construct in parallel. The original thread will be denoted as ""master thread"" with thread ID 0. Example (C program): Display ""Hello, world."" using multiple threads. Use flag -fopenmp to compile using GCC:  Output on a computer with 2 Cores and 2 threads. However, the output may also be garbled because of the race condition caused from the two threads sharing the standard output. Work-sharing constructs. Used to specify how to assign independent work to one or all of the threads. Example: initialize the value of a large array in parallel, using each thread to do part of the work OpenMP clauses. Since OpenMP is a shared memory programming model, most variables in OpenMP code are visible to all threads by default. But sometimes private variables are necessary to avoid race conditions and there is a need to pass values between the sequential part and the parallel region (the code block executed in parallel), so data environment management is introduced as ""data sharing attribute clauses"" by appending them to the OpenMP directive. The different types of clauses are User-level runtime routines. Used to modify/check the number of threads, detect if the execution context is in a parallel region, how many processors in current system, set/unset locks, timing functions, etc. Environment variables. A method to alter the execution features of OpenMP applications. Used to control loop iterations scheduling, default number of threads, etc. For example ""OMP_NUM_THREADS"" is used to specify number of threads for an application. Sample programs. In this section, some sample programs are provided to illustrate the concepts explained above. Hello World. A basic program that exercises the ""parallel"", ""private"" and ""barrier"" directives, and the functions codice_2 and codice_3 (not to be confused). C. This C program can be compiled using gcc-4.4 with the flag -fopenmp C++. This C++ program can be compiled using GCC: g++ -Wall -fopenmp test.cpp NOTE: The IOstreams library is not thread-safe. Therefore, for instance, ""cout"" calls must be executed in critical areas or by only one thread (e.g. masterthread). Fortran 77. Here is a Fortran 77 version. Fortran 90 free form. Here is a Fortran 90 free form version. Clauses in work-sharing constructs (in C/C++). The application of some OpenMP clauses are illustrated in the simple examples in this section. The piece of code below updates the elements of an array ""b"" by performing a simple operation on the elements of an array ""a"". The parallelization is done by the OpenMP directive ""#pragma omp"". The scheduling of tasks is dynamic. Notice how the iteration counters ""j"" and ""k"" have to be made private, whereas the primary iteration counter ""i"" is private by default. The task of running through ""i"" is divided among multiple threads, and each thread creates its own versions of ""j"" and ""k"" in its execution stack, thus doing the full task allocated to it and updating the allocated part of the array ""b"" at the same time as the other threads. The next piece of code is a common usage of the ""reduction"" clause to calculate reduced sums. Here, we add up all the elements of an array ""a"" with an ""i"" dependent weight using a for-loop which we parallelize using OpenMP directives and reduction clause. The scheduling is kept static. An equivalent, less elegant, implementation of the above code is to create a local sum variable for each thread (""loc_sum""), and make a protected update of the global variable ""sum"" at the end of the process, through the directive ""critical"". Note that this protection is crucial, as explained elsewhere. Implementations. OpenMP has been implemented in many commercial compilers. For instance, Visual C++ 2005, 2008 and 2010 support it (in their Professional, Team System, Premium and Ultimate editions), as well as Intel Parallel Studio for various processors. Oracle Solaris Studio compilers and tools support the latest OpenMP specifications with productivity enhancements for Solaris OS (UltraSPARC and x86/x64) and Linux platforms. The Fortran, C and C++ compilers from The Portland Group also support OpenMP 2.5. GCC has also supported OpenMP since version 4.2. Compilers with an implementation of OpenMP 3.0: Several compilers support OpenMP 3.1:  Auto-parallelizing compilers that generates source code annotated with OpenMP directives: Pros and cons. Pros  Cons Performance expectations. One might expect to get an ""N"" times speedup when running a program parallelized using OpenMP on a ""N"" processor platform. However, this seldom occurs for these reasons: Thread affinity. Some vendors recommend setting the processor affinity on OpenMP threads to associate them with particular processor cores. This minimizes thread migration and context-switching cost among cores. It also improves the data locality and reduces the cache-coherency traffic among the cores (or processors). Benchmarks. There are some public domain OpenMP benchmarks for users to try. "
wikipedia-381844," Suceava  Suceava (; , , , ) is the Suceava County seat, in Bukovina region, in north-eastern Romania. The city was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia from 1388 to 1565. History. Dimitrie Cantemir in his famous work ""Descriptio Moldaviae"" gives the origin of the name as Hungarian: Szűcsvár, meaning city of furriers. For nearly 200 years the city of Suceava was the capital of the Moldavian state and main residence of the Moldavian princes (between 1388 and 1565). The city was the capital of the lands of Stephen the Great, one of the pivotal figures in Romanian history, who died in Suceava in 1504. He built a church every time he defeated an enemy army. During the rule of Alexandru Lăpuşneanu, the seat was moved to Iaşi in 1565. Michael the Brave captured the city in 1600 during the Moldavian Magnate Wars in attempt to unite Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, but he was defeated the same year and Suceava failed to become the capital again. Together with the rest of Bukovina, Suceava was under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy (later Austria-Hungary) from 1775 to 1918; the border of Habsburg domains passed just south-east of the city. At the end of World War I, it became part of Greater Romania. During the communist period in Romania, Suceava was heavily industrialized. Demographics. As of 2011 census data, Suceava has a population of 86,282, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census (105,865), making it the 23rd largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup was as follows: Tourism. In the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly. The most important sights in the town date from its time as a princely capital. Founded in 1390 by Petru I of Moldavia, it is the oldest church in Suceava, and established the city as a see of the church (which later moved to the). Stephen the Great was crowned in this church in 1457 and the church remained the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. Founded by Bogdan the One-eyed in 1514. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of the seven churches listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site (see Painted churches of northern Moldavia). Saint John the New was a Moldavian monk who preached during Turkish occupation and was subsequently martyred in Cetatea Alba, present-day Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine. Alexander the Good brought his relics to Moldavia in 1415. The monastery serves as the seat of the Archbishop of Suceava and Radauti. This church was founded by Petru Rareş, the son of Stephan the Great, in 1534, with a bell tower added in 1561, and the frescoes inside restored recently Built by Vasile Lupu in 1643 There are numerous museums in the city: the Bucovina History Museum, the Bucovina Village Museum, the Bucovina Ethnographic Museum (housed in an inn from the 17th century), and the Natural History Museum. Furthermore, there is the Cetatea de Scaun or Princely Citadel, like the Mirǎuti Church founded by Petru I of Moldavia when he moved the capital from Siret to Suceava. Alexander the Good and Stephen the Great expanded the citadel, and it became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (the conqueror of Constantinople), in 1476 . Schools.

wikipedia-381857," Râmnicu Vâlcea  Râmnicu Vâlcea (also spelled ""Rîmnicu Vîlcea"", ) (population: 92,573) is the capital city of Vâlcea County, Romania (in the historical province of Oltenia). Geography and climate. Râmnicu Vâlcea is situated in the central-south area of Romania. Set at the foothills of the Southern Carpathians, the city is located at about from the Cozia Mountains and about from the Făgăraş and Lotrului Mountains. The southern limit of Râmnicu Vâlcea is formed by the Getic Plateau and the Oltului Valley. The Olt River crosses the town of Râmnicu Vâlcea as well as the E81 road of European interest and one of the main national railway routes. History. The area has been inhabited since Dacian and Roman times, and was the site of a castrum. A new fortress was built on the location during the Middle Ages. Râmnicu Vâlcea was first attested during the rule of Prince Mircea cel Bătrân, as """"the princely town of Râmnic"""" (September 4, 1388), and confirmed as the seat of a Vâlcea County during the same period (January 8, 1392). The town seal dates to 1505. ""Cetăţuia"", the actual fortress, served as the residence of Oltenian Bans and, from 1504, of the Orthodox bishops of the Râmnic Diocese; in 1543, Prince Radu de la Afumaţi was killed in ""Cetăţuia"" by a boyar conspiracy. During the rules of Matei Basarab and Constantin Brâncoveanu, it became an important cultural center. It was here where the first paper mill and printing press in Romania were built (""see Anthim the Iberian""). The city was heavily damaged during the Habsburg takeover of Oltenia between 1718 and 1739, and its purpose was again reduced to that of a fortress. During the Wallachian Revolution, on July 29, 1848, ""Deşteaptă-te, române!"" (the national anthem of Romania), with lyrics written by Andrei Mureşanu and music composed by Anton Pann (whose memorial house lies in the center of the town), was sung for the first time in Râmnicu Vâlcea. Gheorghe Magheru gathered his military force in Râureni, now part of the city, in an attempt to face the anti-revolutionary forces of Imperial Russia and the Ottoman Empire. In the 1980s, the city was completely rebuilt in a style combining Socialist realism with local vernacular architecture. Râmnicu Vâlcea has gained some notoriety as an alleged global centre for cybercrime more recently. Politics. The mayor of Râmnicu Vâlcea is Romeo Rădulescu, former Democratic Party candidate, now independent, and two deputy mayors, Eusebiu Veţeleanu, also independent, and Monceanu Constantin, from National Liberal Party. The Râmnicu Vâlcea Municipal Council, elected in the June 2004 local government elections, is made up of 23 councillors, with the following party composition: Industry. Oltchim S.A. Ramnicu Valcea was one of the largest chemical companies in Romania. It provides chemical products since 1966 and it is the most important exporter on Chlorosodics, Polyether Polyols and Propylene Oxide markets in Eastern and Central Europe. Besides this, it is the second PVC producer in the area. It is a very important employer in the area of Ramnicu Valcea, with no less than 5000 employees. They promote commitment to environment and re-technologization for the safety of the surroundings and of their employees. In 2009 and 2010, the company had to lower production and lay off employees because of the financial crisis and it became one of the first companies to receive aid from the government. In 2012, the company was declared bankrupt. Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999. Râmnicu Vâlcea () was the center and peak point of the path of total darkness of the 1999 Solar Eclipse at noon of August 11. Sport. Râmnicu Vâlcea is home to CS Oltchim Râmnicu Vâlcea is a women handball club which competes in the Liga Naţională and the Women's Champions League. Villages. The city administers thirteen villages: Aranghel, Căzăneşti, Copăcelu, Dealu Malului, Feţeni, Goranu, Lespezi, Poenari, Priba, Râureni, Săliştea, Stolniceni and Troian. Goranu, Feţeni, Lespezi and Săliştea were a separate commune, ""Goranu"", until 1996, when they were merged into the city. "
wikipedia-381860," Big Wing  The Big Wing, also known as a Balbo, was an air fighting tactic proposed during the Battle of Britain by 12 Group commander Air Vice-Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Acting Squadron Leader Douglas Bader. In essence, the tactic involved meeting incoming Luftwaffe bombing raids in strength with a wing-sized formation of three to five squadrons. In the Battle, this tactic was employed by the Duxford Wing, under Bader's command. The name ""Balbo"" refers to Italo Balbo, an Italian air force officer famous for leading large formations of aircraft on long distance flights before the war. Big Wing vs Park's approach. The Big Wing contrasted with the tactics used by Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, the commanding officer of Fighter Command's 11 Group, which was taking the brunt of the Luftwaffe attacks.  Park met the raids with individual squadrons, which he considered to be the most flexible and effective use of his aircraft, particularly in light of the shallow depth of penetration of Britain's airspace by the Germans. He used ""hit and run"" tactics with an enemy raid potentially being engaged by several squadrons in turn. The tactic had been questioned by many of Park's subordinates, who were appalled by the high loss rates amongst the squadrons of 11 Group. In this battle of attrition they wanted to employ larger formations to provide mutual protection and reduce casualties. By contrast, Leigh-Mallory, the commander of the neighbouring 12 Group to the north, was a powerful advocate of the Big Wing policy, causing enormous friction in his working relationship with Park. One of Leigh-Mallory's subordinates was the acting leader of 242 (Canadian) Squadron RAF, Douglas Bader, who had flown as part of Keith Park's own Big Wings over Dunkirk just a few weeks earlier. Experience covering the French beaches against air attack had convinced Bader that large formations were essential and with Leigh-Mallory's blessing a special wing was formed at RAF Duxford to try to prove the Big Wing theory. Supported by Duxford station commander Group Captain 'Woody' Woodhall, Baders' 'wing' theory was developed over the next few days, and initially involved three squadrons, No. 242 and No. 310 (Czech) flying Hawker Hurricanes and No. 19 Squadron RAF (based at nearby RAF Fowlmere) flying Supermarine Spitfires. On 7 September 1940, the ""Big Wing"" was scrambled operationally for the first time, to patrol North Weald, but the formation arrived late. Bader acknowledged the fact that they were too slow forming up and for the flight to the patrol area the formation was too disjointed. Nevertheless the ""Big Wing"" claimed 11 enemy aircraft destroyed for the loss of one fighter.  Over a number of days in September 1940, the wing was sent up to try to disrupt the Luftwaffe raiders. The Duxford Big Wing was not an organised and rehearsed military unit, merely an ad-hoc collection of squadrons led by one of Fighter Command's less experienced squadron leaders. Between Leigh-Mallory and Bader there was no planning on how to use a Big Wing nor an assessment of its achievements. On 9 September two more squadrons, the Hurricanes of No 302 (Polish) and the Spitfires of No. 611 Squadron RAF, were allocated to the ""Big Wing"" and again Park requested protection of the 11 Group airfields. The result was practically a carbon copy of 7 September.  Park himself had experimented with large wings (covering the earlier Dunkirk evacuation) and insisted that they were unwieldy, difficult to manoeuvre into position, and rarely in the right place when needed. 11 Group was closer to the enemy than 12 Group, and Park pointed out that there was insufficient time available over Kent and Sussex for a large formation to gain crucial altitude against the incoming raids. Bader countered by pointing out that his wing could be used as a reserve for 11 Group. Positioned well away from the Luftwaffe bases in France he could be in place at altitude when the wing was needed, providing adequate early warning was given. Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, commanding officer of RAF Fighter Command, had put a huge amount of effort into developing the world's first complete air defence system incorporating the Chain Home radar stations, Royal Observer Corps ground observation posts, telecommunications and information processing. The best early warning possible was provided to 12 Group. Bader further delayed deployment of 12 Group fighters by insisting he lead the Big Wing, in order to do this he had to fly 242 Squadron to Duxford from RAF Coltishall every day. Bader wanted time in order to fly to Duxford, land, take-off again then form a Big Wing, the amount of early warning required for this was extremely unrealistic.  The Duxford Big Wing was also a mix of Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons, the Spitfires were thus delayed as they had to fly and climb at the same speed as the slower Hurricanes.  Bader did not always follow ground control instructions and often flew into 11 Group's area on his own inititative. In order for such a large formation to be successful, not only should it be well planned and rehearsed, but its leadership had to be disciplined within Fighter Command's overall battle plan. That was blatantly disregarded. If Leigh-Mallory had a vested interest in the Big Wing then he had a responsibility to make sure that at least it was organised properly.  This clash of opinions between the 11 and 12 Group commanders was left unresolved by Leigh-Mallory and Park's commander, Dowding. Subsequent events, in which Dowding retired from his post at Fighter Command and Leigh-Mallory was promoted to command Keith Park's group, show that Leigh-Mallory's arguments had the sympathies of the senior echelons of the RAF. These sympathies could have been due to tensions between these senior RAF officers and Dowding rather than any thought on how Britain could be most effectively defended.  In ""Spitfire: Portrait of a Legend"", Leo McKinstry cites sources saying that Dowding was widely criticised after the Battle in RAF reviews of his strategy for keeping the control of 11 and 12 Group resources separate under Park and Leigh-Mallory, instead of uniting them under one command or at least coordinating them as one Group. The effect of this decision was a lack of coordination between 11 and 12 Groups which often meant the aircraft of 11 Group were fully committed, while those of 12 Group sat idle.  A letter by Park in 1968, quoted by McKinstry, illustrates the problem: According to McInstry in another letter Park wrote at the time he said, ""Frankly I was more worried at the lack of cooperation (with Leigh-Mallory), than I was about out-witting the massed German raids."" What has been described as an ""even-handed"" assessment of the affair was published in the Air Ministry's Air Historical Branch history, written shortly after the battle: ""he pity is that a controversy was ever allowed to develop; for far from the two Group commanders representing two contrasting methods of solving one and the same tactical problem they really represented tactics complementary to each other, each of which had a valuable part to play in the common struggle, the more so as together the most economical use of the dangerously limited forces available would have been assured."" (Note that this assessment is according to the Air Ministry of which the most senior individuals were involved in using the Big Wing theory as the means to conspire against Dowding. Given this and the personal animosity towards Dowding the Air Ministry view of the Battle of Britain cannot be said to be ""even-handed"". As first published by the Air Ministry there was no mention of Dowding or Park, it was withdrawn and revised at Winston Churchill's insistence) Further evidence of this conflict can also be seen in a memo, again cited by McKinstry, which Leigh-Mallory sent to Park during the Battle, ""Full explanation required why 11 Group fighters have shot down enemy fighters over 12 Group area."" This is more than a little ironic given that 12 Group was expected to bolster defence in 11 Group's area (by shooting enemy planes down) but instead a Big Wing was sent, often to the wrong place causing more disruption to 11 Group's well thought-out plans than to the enemy. Did the Big Wing work? After the Battle of Britain Leigh-Mallory never really had a chance to use the Big Wing defensively again. The Big Wing quickly mutated from a defensive to an offensive formation, Douglas Bader would eventually lead one of these new wings on massive fighter sweeps over France. To this day there is debate over the effectiveness of the 'Big Wing' as it was used during the Battle.  On the one hand, although Leigh-Mallory and Bader claimed it was a great success, post-war analysis suggests the actual number of German aircraft shot down by the wing was probably a fraction of those claimed (The claims for the Big Wing were never credible even at the time. Some senior people like Leigh-Mallory and Sholto Douglas wanted to believe these claims so that they could use the Big Wing as a political tool against Dowding). This would seem to support the idea that, for a 'Big Wing', there were ""not enough enemy to go around"". In other words, the Wing had too high a concentration of aircraft in the same air space looking for targets. It could be argued that 12 Group had more time to get fighters into position but even then it failed to do so. As a consequence when 11 Group was stretched to its limits and required support, due to the delay imposed by 12 Group, 11 Group airfields were left undefended. This was due not only to time wasted in forming up the big wing but also due to 12 Group commanders not following 11 Group's instructions and arriving in the wrong place. Not only did 12 Group fail to support 11 Group they left their own airfields undefended, a large portion of UK airspace was left undefended while Leigh-Mallory and Bader tested their Big Wing theory. The time taken to form a big wing also wasted fuel and combined with the limited range of the fighters reduced time over the combat zone. When 10 Group was asked to provide cover for 11 Group in similar circumstances it was provided and the relevant 11 Group airfields were defended. On the other hand, casualties for the 'Big Wing' were significantly lower than in the smaller formations - suggesting that they did indeed benefit from protection in numbers. The 'Big Wing' invariably joined combat with the enemy over Northern London, where the German fighter escort was at the very limit of its range and therefore effectiveness. The Big Wing also made very few interceptions, as a result lower casualties would be expected - on both sides.  Certainly Park's tactics (which had included the occasional use of two and three-squadron wings) were correct for the conditions he had to fight under. The most powerful argument against the Big Wing's use in the Battle of Britain is that without a clear idea of a raid's target as it assembled over France, it was impossible for the Big Wing to get airborne and form up in time to meet the enemy. Another argument against the use of the Duxford Big Wing was that it was never a serious tactical proposition. It was formed after a telephone discussion between Leigh Mallory and Bader, there was no planning, protocols for its operation nor discussion (let alone agreement) within Fighter Command. Leigh-Mallory did not question Bader's claims nor critically assess the Big Wing's results. For a senior commander to take the word of an inexperienced junior officer and commit to such a poorly planned experiment at a critical time is very questionable. The successful interceptions by the Big Wing only occurred over a short period of time in September when the Luftwaffe switched from military targets and airfields to daylight raids on London. The Luftwaffe bombers were at their most vulnerable when they were at the limit of the escorting Bf 109's range and many German fighters had already expended their fuel in combat with 11 Group aircraft over Kent.  When encountered by the Luftwaffe on 15 September the Big Wing had a psychological impact. Having been told that the RAF was down to its last 50 fighters by their leaders the Luftwaffe aircrew were continuously attacked on the run over Kent only to be confronted by a further formation of 60 RAF aircraft over London just as their escort reached the limit of their range. One reason for this level of surprise was that a recent large Luftwaffe fighter-only sweep had encountered little resistance, confirming the Luftwaffe leaders' belief that there were few RAF fighters left; in fact Park had recognised this fighter sweep as a ruse to get his fighters into the air, but with no threat of bombing he had kept his fighters on the ground on this occasion.  While not effective as a fighting tactic the Big Wing, along with some blatant manipulation of statistics, worked as a political tool for those against Dowding. Dowding had clashed with Hugh Trenchard (founder of the RAF) while both were RFC commanders during World War I. Hugh Trenchard was retired by World War II but was a Marshall of the RAF and still had heavy influence at the highest level in the RAF. He supported the theory of the ""knock out blow"" where air attack was fought by counter attack with bombers, not defence by fighters, and this view was shared by many senior RAF and Air Ministry people. Despite this RAF policy Dowding got enough political support to build up Fighter Command into a very effective weapon, the weapon that won the Battle of Britain. In 1940 (and arguably the whole war) Bomber Command was in no way capable of delivering a knock out blow to Germany so the pro bomber advocates were severely embarrassed by Fighter Command's success. Hugh Dowding's ""stuffy"" personality and unwillingness to fight this political battle also contributed to his downfall. The Big Wing debacle was merely a smokescreen manipulated by his political enemies to bring him down. It is understandable that Dowding did not fight back given the stress he had been under for the best part of a year, first to conserve Fighter Command then to oversee the long battle of attrition against the Luftwaffe. A 'Big Wing' exercise. The use of a 'Big Wing' within 11 Group was explored by Fighter Command in paper exercises run by Leigh-Mallory in January 1941. The intention was to prove the superiority of large formations using the circumstances of an actual attack on Kenley, Biggin Hill and Hornchurch sectors on 6 September 1940. In the event Leigh-Mallory completely mismanaged the operation, permitting the raid to progress unhindered and resulting in Kenley and Biggin Hill airbases being 'bombed' while their aircraft were still on the ground. One of Park's former controllers explained Leigh-Mallory's mistakes to him. He replied that he would do better next time and that if a large-scale raid approached he would permit it to bomb its target and intercept it in force on its return to France. The enemy, he believed, would be so badly mauled that there would be no more raids. "
wikipedia-381862," Werewolf fiction  Werewolf fiction denotes the portrayal of werewolves and other shapeshifting man/woman-beasts, in the media of literature, drama, film, games, and music. Werewolf literature includes folklore, legend, saga, fairy tales, Gothic and Horror fiction, fantasy fiction and poetry. Such stories may be supernatural, symbolic or allegorical. A classic American cinematic example of the theme is ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) and in later films joins with Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, as one of the three famous icons of the modern day horror. However, werewolf fiction is an exceptionally diverse genre with ancient folkloric roots and manifold modern re-interpretations. History. Literary origins. In medieval romances, such as ""Bisclavret"", and ""Guillaume de Palerme"" the werewolf is relatively benign, appearing as the victim of evil magic and aiding knights errant. However, in most legends influenced by medieval theology the werewolf was a satanic beast with a craving for human flesh. This appears in such later fiction as ""The White Wolf of the Hartz Mountains"": an episode in the novel ""The Phantom Ship"" (1839) by Marryat, featuring a demonic femme fatale who transforms from woman to wolf. Sexual themes are common in werewolf fiction; the protagonist kills his girlfriend as she walks with a former lover in ""Werewolf of London"", suggesting sexual jealousy. The writers of ""Wolf Man"" were careful in depicting killings as motivated out of hunger. The wolf in the fairy tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" has been reinterpreted as a werewolf in many works of fiction, such as ""The Company of Wolves"" (1979) by Angela Carter (and its 1984 ""film adaptation"") and the film ""Ginger Snaps"" (2000), which address female sexuality. 2011 also saw the release of ""Red Riding Hood (2011 film)"" with Amanda Seyfried in the main role, with the character name of Valerie. Nineteenth century. Nineteenth century Gothic horror stories drew on previous folklore and legend to present the theme of the werewolf in a new fictional form. An early example is ""Hugues, the Wer-Wolf"" by Sutherland Menzies published in 1838. In another, ""Wagner the Wehr-Wolf"" (1847) by G. W. M. Reynolds, we find the classic subject of a man cursed to be transformed into a werewolf at the time of the full moon: representing the split personality and evil, bloodthirsty, dark side of humanity itself. ""The Man-Wolf"" (1831) by Leitch Ritchie yields the werewolf in a 11th century setting, while Catherine Crowe penned what is believed to be the first werewolf short story by a woman. Other werewolf stories of this period include ""The Wolf Leader"" (1857) by Alexandre Dumas and ""Hugues-le-Loup"" (1869) by Erckmann-Chatrian. A later Gothic story, Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" (1886), has an implicit werewolf subtext, according to Colin Wilson. This has been made explicit in some recent adaptations of this story, such as the BBC TV series ""Jekyll"" (2007). Stevenson's ""Olalla"" (1887) offers more explicit werewolf content, but, like ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", this aspect remains subordinate to the story's larger themes. A rapacious female werewolf who appears in the guise of a seductive femme fatale before transforming into lupine form to devour her hapless male victims is the protagonist of Clemence Housman's acclaimed ""The Were-wolf"" published in 1896. Twentieth century. The twentieth century saw an explosion of werewolf short stories and novels published in both England and America. The famed English supernatural story writer Algernon Blackwood wrote a number of werewolf short stories. These often had an occult aspect to them. American pulp magazines of the 1920 to 1950s, such as ""Weird Tales"", include many werewolf tales, written by such authors as H. Warner Munn, Seabury Quinn, and Manly Wade Wellman. The most renowned werewolf novel of the twentieth century was ""The Werewolf of Paris"" (1933) by American author Guy Endore. This has been accorded classic status and is considered by some to be the ""Dracula"" of werewolf literature. It was adapted as ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" in 1961 for Hammer Film Productions. The first feature film to use an anthropomorphic werewolf was ""Werewolf of London"" in 1935 (not to be confused with the 1981 film of a similar title) establishing the canon that the werewolf always kills what he loves most. The main werewolf of this film was a dapper London scientist who retained some of his style and most of his human features after his transformation. However, he lacked warmth, and it was left to the tragic character Larry Talbot played by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1941's ""The Wolf Man"" to capture the public imagination. This catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness. The theme of lycanthropy as a disease or curse reached its standard treatment in the film, which contained the now-famous rhyme: This movie draws on elements of traditional folklore and fiction, such as the vulnerability of the werewolf to a silver bullet (as seen for instance in the legend of Beast of Gévaudan), though at the climax of the film the Wolf Man is actually dispatched with a silver-headed cane. The process of transmogrification is portrayed in such films and works of literature to be painful. The resulting wolf is typically cunning but merciless, and prone to killing and eating people without compunction, regardless of the moral character of the person when human. Lon Chaney Jr himself became somewhat typecast as the Wolfman and reprised his role in several sequels for Universal Studios. In these films the werewolf lore of the first film was clarified. In ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943) it is firmly established that the Wolf Man is revived at every full moon. In ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) silver bullets are used for the first time to dispatch him. Further sequels were the ""House of Dracula"" (1945) and the parodic ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948) The success of Universal's ""The Wolf Man"" prompted rival Hollywood film companies Columbia Studios and Fox Studios to bring out their own, now somewhat obscure, werewolf movies. The first of these was ""The Undying Monster"" produced by Fox in 1942, adapted from a werewolf novel of the same name by Jessie Douglas Kerruish, published in 1936. In 1981, two prominent werewolf films, ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"", both drew on themes from the Universal series. More recently, the portrayal of werewolves has taken a more sympathetic turn in some circles. With the rise of environmentalism and other back-to-nature ideals, the werewolf has come to be seen as a representation of humanity allied more closely with nature. Author Whitley Strieber previously explored these themes in his novels ""The Wolfen"" (1978), in which werewolves are shown to act as predators of humanity, acting as a ""natural"" control on their population now that it has been removed from the traditional limits of nature, and ""The Wild"" (1991), in which the werewolf is portrayed as a medium through which to bring human intelligence and spirit back into nature. The heroic werewolf has also returned via the paranormal romance genre, where wolf-like characteristics such as loyalty are shown as positive traits in a prospective mate. Werewolves have featured a number of times in the long-running British science fiction television series ""Doctor Who"" and its other media tie-ins. The first time a werewolf appeared in the television series was in the Seventh Doctor serial ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" (1988). A wolf-man appears in the 1986 Sixth Doctor story ""Mindwarp"", and the primords in the 1970 Third Doctor story ""Inferno"" are also lupine in appearance, but in both cases these are induced mutations rather than people who switched between human and wolf forms. They also appeared in the 2006 Tenth Doctor episode ""Tooth and Claw"". In the ""Harry Potter"" series (1997–2007) the most prominent werewolf is Remus Lupin who's portrayed as struggling with his curse and terrified of infecting someone. The series also includes a werewolf villain Fenrir Greyback, who fits more with the older image of werewolves. The ""Potter"" books, while showing the intense threat the humans transformed to bloodthirsty monsters pose to the population, essentially use werewolves as a metaphor for marginalised groups who have been discriminated against in modern society. A very popular modern subgenre consists of stories that treat werewolves as separate race or species (either science fictional or magical) or as persons using magic in order to deliberately transform into wolves at will. Such current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or being transmitted like a disease by the bite of another werewolf. The form a werewolf takes is not always an ordinary wolf, but is often anthropomorphic or may be otherwise larger and more powerful than an ordinary wolf. Sometimes the beast form of the werewolf will have some physical characteristics borrowed from an animal species other than the wolf, as can be seen in the boar-like werewolf of ""Wild Country"" (2006). Many modern werewolves are also supposedly immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver objects (usually a bullet or blade). This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns. Despite the recent upsurge in the motif of heroic werewolves, unsympathetic portrayals of werewolves as monsters also continue to be common in popular culture. This is especially true in movies, which are only slowly incorporating trends in written fiction. There are very few werewolf movies outside the horror genre. In the movie ""War Wolves"", recently shown on the ""Sci-Fi"" channel, lycanthropy doesn't have an influence on the ""victims'"" alignment. Instead, it is up to the individual to choose whether to use their abilities for good or evil. Both the heroes and villains in the movie are werewolves from the same military unit. Lists. Literature.

wikipedia-381864," Robert Gordon University  The Robert Gordon University, commonly referred to as RGU, is a public university in the city of Aberdeen, Scotland. It became a university in 1992, and originated from an educational institution founded in the 18th century by Robert Gordon, a prosperous Aberdeen merchant, and various institutions which provided adult education and technical education in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of two universities in the city (the other is the much older University of Aberdeen). According to the 2013 ""Times Good University Guide"" it is the best modern university in the UK, while according to ""The Guardian University Guide 2013"" it is the best modern university in Scotland and 2nd-best in the UK. It was shortlisted for Sunday Times University of the Year 2012 and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ""The Sunday Times University Guide"". Of those who graduated from full-time undergraduate degrees in 2011 and 2012, over 97% were in employment or further study within six months - the most of any university in the UK. The university, which brands itself “the professional university”, awards degrees in a wide range of disciplines from BA/BSc to PhD, primarily in (but not limited to) professional, technical and artistic disciplines and those most applicable to business and industry. A number of traditional academic degree programmes are also offered, such as in the social sciences. Disciplines available include the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, computing science, pharmacy, nursing, allied health professions, social work, law, accountancy, business administration, management, journalism, fine art, applied arts and design, and architecture. In addition, the university's academic and research staff produce world-class research in a number of areas. The university also provides services to business and industry including consultancy and professional development. RGU has a single campus in Aberdeen, at Garthdee, in the south-west of the city amid parkland by the banks of the River Dee. The university also operates an Administration Building and Student Union in Aberdeen city centre, at Schoolhill. Until Summer 2013 a second campus was also located here and at St. Andrew Street nearby, but this campus has now closed apart from the Administration Building, which is to be retained. Academic departments located there have moved to new buildings at the main Garthdee campus. History. The university derives from Robert Gordon's Hospital, an institution set up in the mid-18th century to provide the poor with a basic education and reasonable start in life, and the various educational institutions which developed in Aberdeen to provide adults with technical, vocational and artistic training, mostly in the evenings and part-time. Following numerous mergers between these establishments, it became Robert Gordon's Technical College in 1910, then following further developments became Robert Gordon's Institute of Technology in 1965 and began to conduct increasing amounts of research and provide degree-level education (by now mostly offering day classes to full-time students). Finally, it became a university in 1992. Unlike some modern universities in the UK which were created following the government reforms of 1992, it has never been a polytechnic (these were never part of the Scottish education system). Founding Institutions. Robert Gordon was a Scottish merchant, who had grown up in Aberdeen and graduated from Marischal College. Following a successful career, mostly in Danzig where he amassed a fortune, he retired to Aberdeen around 1720. In the last decade of his life, he prepared plans for a Hospital similar to that founded in Edinburgh by George Heriot. The purpose of Robert Gordon’s Hospital was “""the Maintenance, Aliment, Entertainment and Education of young boys whose parents are poor and indigent… and to put them to Trades and Employment""”. Gordon died in 1731, and left his entire fortune to the project. However, it took nearly two decades for buildings to be completed, with the first boys admitted in 1750. The aim was not a sophisticated education, but to provide the poor with a reasonable start in life. Boys were taken in between 8 and 11 years old and received food, accommodation and a basic education including English, Latin, writing and arithmetic. They left the Hospital between 14 and 16 years old as an apprentice in a trade or to a merchant. The Hospital expanded through the 18th and 19th centuries. Meanwhile, in the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution led to a greater need for scientific and technical education for working-class adults, with “Mechanic’s Institutes” spreading through Scotland, patterned on that founded by George Birkbeck at Glasgow (he would later found Birkbeck College, the University of London’s night school). The Aberdeen Mechanic’s Institution opened in 1824 providing evening classes in subjects such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, book-keeping, maritime navigation and art. By 1855 it was receiving government funding as the School of Science and Art, with a Technical School founded two years later. Child and adult education combined: Robert Gordon’s College (1881). Government education reforms in the 1870s saw the “Hospital” system fall out of favour and encouraged mergers with other educational establishments. As part of these reforms, the Aberdeen Mechanic’s Institute and Technical School merged with Robert Gordon’s Hospital in 1881. The resulting institution was known as Robert Gordon’s College. It provided an education for boys but as a day school only, and evening (and later day) classes for adults (male and female) in science, technology, commerce and general subjects. Art classes offered by the Mechanic’s Institution were transferred to a new, independent School of Art close by, paid for by local businessman John Gray and opened in 1885. Splitting child from adult: Robert Gordon’s Technical College (1910 on). By the end of the 19th century, Robert Gordon’s College was a major provider of technical education, receiving large government grants. Following further reforms, in 1903 the adult education part of the College was designated a Central Institution along with Gray’s School of Art (which became a Central Institution two years earlier), allowing the adult education activities to develop independently rather than under the control of the local School Board. However, even this was not sufficient to meet demand for technical education, and dedicated Technical Colleges were being set up in other Scottish cities. As a result, in 1910 adult education activities were split from the school and became Robert Gordon's Technical College. Also merged into the new Technical College was the city’s School of Domestic Economy which provided classes in domestic science. The day school for boys continued as Robert Gordon's College, and the two institutions shared a campus, buildings and until 1981, a Board of Governors and administrative staff. During the 1920s, the first Ordinary and Higher Certificates and Diplomas were awarded, and by the 1930s Robert Gordon’s Technical College was made up of Schools of Engineering, Chemistry, Maths & Physics, Pharmacy, Art (including architecture), Domestic Science, and Navigation. Around this time the first students began to be prepared for external degree examinations – for the University of Aberdeen’s BSc in Engineering. A system of student governance also developed, with a Student Representative Council formed in 1931. In the closing years of World War II, candidates started to be prepared to sit exams for external degrees of the University of London, in subjects such as Chemistry and Engineering, but only via part-time and/or evening classes. After 1945, to aid with settling large numbers of returning soldiers into a career, the Government backed a Business Training Scheme which allowed the Technical College to introduce courses in Business Administration. Technical College to Institute (1965) to University (1992). In 1955, the Technical College received a large gift of land. Local property developer and entrepreneur Tom Scott Sutherland purchased the Victorian manor and estate of Garthdee House in 1953, located by the banks of the River Dee on the outskirts of the city. Finding himself and his wife living out of only four rooms in the enormous mansion, he donated it and the estate in 1955 for a new school of architecture. These classes had taken place at Gray's School of Art, but had been expanding in the 1940s and 50s and much more space was needed. Following completion of a modern extension to the house, the new Scott Sutherland School of Architecture opened in 1957. In 1966, Gray’s School of Art also moved to a large new building on this estate, freeing its Schoolhill building for administrative use. By 2013, all activities had transferred to Garthdee, with the addition of land immediately adjacent purchased from Aberdeen City Council in the 1990s. The 1963 Robbins Report on the future of UK higher education recommended major expansion, which led to the renaming of the institution to Robert Gordon’s Institute of Technology to suggest its increasing role in higher education rather than further education. As well as new “plate-glass” universities, reforms following the report created the polytechnics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It also created the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) to allow non-university institutions (like the polytechnics and Scottish central institutions) to run programmes that graduated students with CNAA degrees. The Institute’s first CNAA degree programmes began in pharmacy in 1967, then in engineering, chemistry and physics in 1969, and expanded at undergraduate and postgraduate level to all disciplines. Around this time, the government also began to transfer non-degree teaching (e.g. certificate courses in navigation) to local-authority colleges. During the 1960s, an academic committee structure was set up, headed from 1969 by an Academic Council. During the 1970s, these committees underwent expansion and reform to improve participation by academic staff in decision-making. For the first time, a faculty structure was introduced, with Faculties of Art & Architecture, Engineering, Arts, and Sciences, led by deans. A department dedicated to providing computer services to the Institute was also established in 1974, and the first professorships were introduced in 1975. In 1981, the separation of the Board of Governors and administration staff from Robert Gordon’s College was completed, although the school and Institute continued to share some buildings. Beginning in the 1970s, the Institute also began to provide extensive consultancy and training for the North Sea oil industry, particularly in engineering and offshore safety and survival. The Robert Gordon University (1992 to present). Following the reforms of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the Institute was awarded university status as The Robert Gordon University on 12 June 1992. The new university inherited numerous small campuses, and during the late 1990s and 2000s embarked on large building projects (primarily at Garthdee) to consolidate teaching at its City Centre and Garthdee campuses, assisted by a large purchase of land from Aberdeen City Council in the mid-1990s. During this time student numbers also expanded considerably. A merger with the University of Aberdeen was discussed in 2002, but was rejected in favour of remaining separate but collaborating more closely. From around 2000 until 2013 the university operated two campuses, at Garthdee (now the main campus) and at Schoolhill and St. Andrew Street in Aberdeen city centre. However, it had been planned since the early 1990s to eventually move all facilities to a single campus at Garthdee, and during this time additional land was purchased there to enable new state-of-the-art academic buildings to be constructed. These opened in Summer 2013, after which the City-Centre campus closed apart from the Administration Building and Student Union on Schoolhill. RGU is now a single-campus university. Recent Awards. In ""The Guardian University Guide 2013"", RGU ranks 35th in the UK (above the University of Aberdeen at 38th) and is the best modern university in Scotland and 2nd-best modern university in the UK (behind University of the Arts London). Of the 120 universities in the list, Coventry University is the next-best post-1992 university at 46th. The Sunday Times awarded RGU the title of Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 in its ""University Guide 2012"". The title had previously been won by Oxford Brookes University for each of the preceding ten years. RGU received the 2012 award partly due to ratings of the quality of teaching and research, but also due to its employment record which was judged the best of any UK university. The citation read: """"With just 3.8% of graduates unemployed six months after leaving, a degree from the Robert Gordon University (RGU) is as near to a guarantee of a job after graduation as you can get...RGU's graduates don't just get jobs, they get good ones, with 84.9% securing jobs commensurate with their qualifications...with starting salaries at an impressive £20,897"""". RGU was also named as Best Modern University in the UK in ""The Times Good University Guide 2013"". The university was also shortlisted for Sunday Times University of the Year 2012 (the only post-1992 university on the shortlist), but the title was awarded to the University of Bath. In ""The Complete University Guide 2014"", RGU is at 53rd place (out of 124), and is the highest-ranking post-1992 university in Scotland, and jointly the third-highest post-1992 university in the UK (with the University of Hertfordshire). The two UK post-1992 universities ranked higher were Oxford Brookes University and the University of Lincoln. Graduate Employment. For at least two years, the Robert Gordon University has had the highest rate among the UK universities of graduates in employment or postgraduate study six months after graduation. In July 2012, the Higher Education Statistics Agency released figures for graduate employment for those who graduated in 2011. Six months after graduation, 97.1% of RGU graduates from full-time undergraduate degree programmes were in employment or further study, the highest level of graduate employment of any UK university (although a small number of higher education institutions specialising in only one discipline, such as the Royal Academy of Music, Harper Adams University College and the Institute of Education, scored higher). Other universities scoring highly were the University of Northampton (95.6%), King's College London (95.2%) and the University of Glasgow (94.9%). This result was repeated in the statistics for 2012, with 97.7% of RGU's 2012 graduates in work or further study within six months. As the previous year, only specialized institutions such as the Royal Academy of Music and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance had a higher percentage of graduate employment than the Robert Gordon University. Other universities scoring highly in 2012 were Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln (97.0%), the University of Buckingham (96.9%), Glasgow Caledonian University (96.2%) and the University of Derby (96.1%). Symbols and Corporate Identity. The university's logo and corporate identity make frequent use of the colour purple and the ""Gordon"" font, all of which appear extensively on campus signage, printed material and online. The current logo was unveiled in February 2013. From 2009 to 2013, the logo consisted of a roundel derived from the university's coat of arms. Most Universities in the UK are designated by order of the Privy Council; unusually for a university named after an individual, according to ""The Robert Gordon University (Scotland) Order of Council 1993"" the official name of the university includes the prefix ""The"" (as with The George Washington University, The Ohio State University and The College of William & Mary). However, current university branding typically leaves it out (e.g. on website text and other official materials). Coat of Arms. The coat of arms derives from the one issued by the Lord Lyon King of Arms (the state official responsible for heraldry in Scotland) to Robert Gordon's Institute of Technology in 1982, which in turn derives from that first used in 1881 by the governors of Robert Gordon's Hospital when it became Robert Gordon's College. The arms consist of a shield only and are used infrequently, usually at formal occasions such as graduation, and can also be seen over the main entrance to the university's Administration Building at Schoolhill and various academic buildings at the main campus at Garthdee, such as the entrance to the Faculty of Health and Social Care building. The shield also formed the previous logo which still features on some older signage. On the left side of the arms, the three boars on a blue background edged in gold are taken from the arms of the Gordon family, while on the right the castle on a red background is taken from the arms of the City of Aberdeen. This symbol of the city is shared with the arms of the University of Aberdeen. A black wavy band divides the two sides, and features heraldic symbols in gold representing technology (a mechanical cog), learning (a flaming torch) and commerce (a gold coin). Motto. The university's motto is ""Omni Nunc Arte Magistra"", which translates literally from Latin as """"Now by all your mastered arts..."""", as if to suggest making use in everyday life of knowledge and skills gained. It is sometimes translated as """"Make the best of all your abilities"""", although this is a somewhat more liberal rendering of the Latin. It comes from Virgil's ""Aeneid"", Book VIII, line 441, as the god Vulcan encourages his workers at the forge. RGU shares this motto with Robert Gordon's College, who use it more frequently. Unlike some universities, the motto is not seen frequently at RGU, although it has appeared in graduation materials and is engraved on the shaft of the university's ceremonial mace. Ceremonial Mace. A ceremonial mace is used at many universities as a symbol of authority and independence. The RGU mace appears mainly at graduation ceremonies, where it is placed prominently on the stage in front of the Chancellor and Principal and in full view of the audience. It may also be seen occasionally at other important university events. The mace is a modern design in silver and black, designed and crafted in 1993 by Gordon Burnett as a gift from the City of Aberdeen to the new university. It was presented to the university at a ceremony on 26 June that year during which the first chancellor of the university, Bob Reid, was installed. The mace is primarily jet-black, with wavy fins edged in silver that run vertically down the full length of the mace's head (reflecting the wavy black band in the university's coat of arms). The coat of arms of the university is inset into the head of the mace, along with golden symbols taken from it - the castle representing the city of Aberdeen, flaming torch, coin, and mechanical cog. The shaft of the mace is inlaid in gold with the university's motto, ""Omni Nunc Arte Magistra"". Images of the mace can be viewed at a page on the university's website. Tartan. Like most Scottish universities, RGU has its own tartan; it mirrors the university's official colours of Royal Blue, Red and Gold which appear on the coat of arms (although purple is now used more frequently day-to-day). The tartan was designed by Michael King in 1997. Some students on their graduation day choose to wear a tartan kilt. Academic Dress. Academic dress at RGU is worn only at very formal occasions, primarily at graduation. Unlike some universities (e.g. the University of Aberdeen), all hoods are a combination of black and white (depending on level of degree awarded) and do not vary in colour by discipline. For all Bachelors degrees (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) a black gown is worn, ending 12 inches (30 cm) from the ground, with a black hood ""partially"" lined with white silk (if graduating, the hood is only put on after the degree has been officially awarded) and a black mortarboard. For all Masters degrees except MPhil (e.g. MSc, MBA), a black gown is worn, ending 8 inches (20 cm) from the ground, with a black hood ""fully"" lined and edged in white silk, and a square backpiece edged in white, along with a black mortarboard. For MPhil, dress is the same but the gown also has facings of white silk 2.5 inches (6 cm) in width. For PhD, the Doctor's black robe (a black Panama gown) is worn; the Doctor's robe has front edges and sleeves in white silk, a pure white silk hood, and a black cloth bonnet with white cord and tassels. Campus. RGU currently operates a single campus in Aberdeen, in the south-western suburbs at Garthdee. While all academic departments are located at Garthdee, the university also has two buildings in the city-centre at Schoolhill - the Administration Building for administrative functions and the Student Union. The university does not have a graduation hall: Graduations take place in July and December, usually in Aberdeen city centre at the Music Hall on Union Street or His Majesty's Theatre on Rosemount Viaduct. City Centre facilities. The university currently operates two non-academic facilities in the city-centre, next to each other on Schoolhill. Buildings at Schoolhill are situated next to the Aberdeen Art Gallery and Robert Gordon's College, a prestigious private school which is no longer affiliated to the university but shares a common heritage and motto. The Administration Building and Student Union are listed and architecturally significant buildings, constructed in the Victorian period of carved and ornamented granite, typical of Aberdeen's famous Granite City architecture. Also located here was the old City Centre campus. Many of these buildings were sold over the years to Robert Gordon's College for school use, while others are for sale or have been sold for redevelopment. The university plans to retain the historic Administration Building for the foreseeable future. The Administration Building has a frontage directly onto the public street of Schoolhill and was completed in 1885. It is a significantly larger building than the street frontage suggests. On completion, it housed Gray's School of Art and was designed by the prominent Aberdeen architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, who designed many of the city's grand granite buildings in the 19th century. The building is constructed of grey and pink Corrennie granite ashlar with Corinthian columns and was designed to match the Aberdeen Art Gallery adjacent to it, and like these buildings, it is Category A listed by Historic Scotland. As the School of Art grew in size, the building was extended in 1896 and again between 1928 and 1931. However, it eventually became too small and when Gray's School of Art moved to a new modernist building at Garthdee in the 1960s (see above), the building was converted for administrative use. From then until 2013 it housed the Principal's Office (which has since moved to the Garthdee campus). Today it provides offices for senior academic and administrative figures and their staff, central administrative functions such as student records, committee and meeting rooms, and other facilities. The Student Union is located next to the Administration Building, on a corner site on the Schoolhill and opposite Belmont Street where many bars and nightclubs are located. It is Aberdeen's only Student Union and contains various bars, a café, and facilities for student meetings and other offices of the university's Students Association. In early 2013 the university announced that the Student Union would close when its building was sold, but it was given a reprieve in summer 2013 but for only 12 months. Main campus (Garthdee). The Garthdee campus is the university's main campus. All academic departments are located here and all teaching and research takes place at this campus. The campus is located in parkland on the outskirts of the city and noted for its modern architecture.  The Garthdee campus is situated in the south-west of the city, on the banks of the River Dee. For much of its history it was a greenfield site, with parts used as the gardens and estate of the manor of Garthdee House, farmland, and open meadows. The first university buildings were in use from the 1950s, with major additional developments in the 1960s, 1990s, 2000s and early 2010s. The design concept produced in the mid-1990s by architects Norman Foster + Partners was to separate the site into three zones; to the north, by the road, would be car parking; a central zone would contain the main buildings, and the southern boundary by the riverbank would be for parkland and wildlife. Ancient lines of beech trees and woodlands were retained in the concept. It also included a ""university street"" running east-west and connecting the buildings, which were to be ""pavilions in the landscape"". These elements of the design concept have been more or less adhered to in subsequent developments by other architects. Travel to Garthdee campus. A bus stop is located on campus at the main plaza, outside the Faculty of Health and Social Care and Riverside East buildings. The campus can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1 and 2 (branded as the Red Line on the city's colour-coded routes) operated by First Aberdeen, which operate approximately every 15 minutes during the day during term-time. The journey time from Union Street is approximately 30 minutes in light traffic, but can take up to an hour if there is heavy traffic and many students are boarding. Both routes begin in the northern suburbs and call at King Street, the Castlegate (opposite the Town House/Sheriff Court), and Union Street (at the stop a little way along from the Trinity Shopping Centre and nearly opposite Belmont Street) before heading to RGU. Route 1 is the more direct to the university (via Holburn Street) and enters the campus to call at the campus bus stop outside the Faculty of Health and Social Care building. Route 2 is less direct (via suburbs) and calls at Garthdee Road for campus gates (but does not actually enter the campus), beginning at the western end of the road close to Gray's School of Art and heading east to return to the city centre. First-time visitors usually find Route 1 more convenient, although regular students and staff make use of both services to take advantage of greater bus frequency. Previous uses of the site. Visible today are the signs of the campus's past as an area of agriculture, a wealthy estate, and industry. The campus today incorporates areas that were formerly in separate ownership. The western end of the campus, up to approximately the Business School building, was the estate of a Victorian manor called Garthdee House. The estate stretched along the river and was owned by a number of private owners until gifted by the architect Tom Scott Sutherland in 1954 (see below for more details about this building). The house still stands (see below) and this area is characterised by a planned estate landscape. The eastern part of the site has had a number of uses, and was owned by Aberdeen City Council until the university purchased it in stages beginning in 1996. Viewed from above, this part of the site is characterised by strips of land divided by lines of beech trees running north–south, with these lines of trees now broken in some areas by campus buildings or other development. These fields suggest that the land had been used for farming. By 1904, Ordnance Survey maps showed the eastern end of the present campus (approximately where the Medical Centre and Riverside East now stand) was mined as a gravel pit. This was abandoned just a few decades later and the area was landscaped to create a caravan park. This included covering over the abandoned gravel pit and installing areas of hard standing, in addition to retaining areas of grass as well as part of the lines of beech trees that had not been felled for the gravel pit. Satellite imagery of the site from 2001 (available on Google Earth) shows the caravan park's areas of hard-standing and connecting roads, prior to construction of the Medical Centre (which opened in 2004), with the Faculty of Health and Social Care building mid-way through construction. The caravan park was operated by the City Council along with another at Hazlehead Park, but according to council planning documents, it had closed some 20 years prior to the university's purchase of the site and lay derelict until then. Between the caravan park and the Victorian estate, the council used the land for allotments; a document proposing draft routes for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, published in 1992 by Grampian Regional Council, describes how one possible route could have cut through the site of the present campus. It would have left the main road at the site of the caravan park, then crossed a field, and then traversed the ""Garthdee Road allotments"" which the report describes as ""worked at present"" - from there, the route would cut through the land of the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture which by then stood on the Victorian estate. Minutes of the city's resources management committee show that the university began to purchase the council's holding of land from the edge of the Victorian estate to the abandoned caravan park site in parcels, with purchases in 1996 (for the Business School building), 2000 (for the Faculty of Health and Social Care building), 2002 (for the Medical Centre) and around 2007 for the remainder of the site (for construction of the Riverside East building). The campus today. The Garthdee campus has seen major investment in recent years, with numerous new buildings constructed since the late 1990s which include a ""University Street"", part of Norman Foster's design concept for the modern campus. Campus buildings are usually named after the faculty or department that they house. The campus extends to 23 hectares, although some of this is currently landscaped parkland, undeveloped, or under construction. In addition, the university owns a further 8 hectares of land to the west (primarily woodland) and 22 hectares at Waterside Farm on the opposite bank of the River Dee; this former farmland is currently undeveloped. According to the university's masterplan for the campus, the Waterside Farm site is at a low level and lies in a 1:200 year floodplain. In 1937, a newspaper report in the ""Glasgow Herald"" described how the three occupants of the farm (the farmer, a housekeeper and a cattleman) became marooned by rising water, which was flooding the site and farmhouse to a depth of three feet. A lifeboat was brought by road from Aberdeen Harbour, launched at Banchory-Devenick some way up the River Dee, and sailed down the river to the farm. The lifeboat crew rescued the trio from the rising floodwaters, plus a kitten and the farm dog. This could not have been the first such occurrence, because the farmer claimed to keep a small boat for when the farm was flooded, but it had been washed away by the torrent. Perhaps as a result of this history of flooding, the Waterside Farm site has been identified as a location for university sports pitches at a future stage of development, to be connected to the main campus on the north bank by a pedestrian/cycle bridge across the river. Urban explorers have investigated the abandoned farm buildings, and posted photographs showing them to be derelict. The main campus is a significant height above the River Dee and is not susceptible to flooding. The Riverside East building opened in late summer 2013, although the University Library it also houses had opened some months earlier. It is the largest building at the university (34,000 square metres) and houses all academic departments previously located at the City Centre campus. Riverside East is situated at the east end of the Garthdee campus, and designed by the major British architects Building Design Partnership (BDP). Construction began in May 2011 and at a cost of £50 million, with a second phase to follow as part of a larger planned development known by the university as ""The Masterplan"". Riverside East provides classrooms, lecture theatres and other teaching facilities, research laboratories, student facilities, social space, and catering facilities to replace those previously at the City Centre. Offices and staff of the Schools of Engineering, Computing Science & Digital Media, and Pharmacy & Life Sciences are based here. In addition, the University Library is located here in the green Learning Tower. The development includes a public plaza paved in granite, as well as ornamental lawns. The building comprises two halves of five floors (north and south), separated by a vast curving atrium which runs the full length of the building and includes a grand staircase. The north section comprises Levels 2 to 6, while the south section faces the river and as a result is set slightly lower, at Levels 1 to 5. The main entrance from the campus plaza is on Level 3, while a large refectory and riverside terrace is on Level 2. In addition, a cylindrical tower clad in green glass provides an additional three levels above the main building for the University Library, for a total of nine floors. The entrance to the library is on Level 5. Within the atrium at other (eastern) end, a four-storey ""Teaching Drum"" provides lecture theatres and multifunctional classrooms. A second phase of development, to follow in later years, will extend each section further east to provide additional teaching and research facilities. The Faculty of Health and Social Care building was designed by Aberdeen-based architects Halliday Fraser Munro and opened in 2002 at a cost of over £21 million. It provides 13,500 square-metres of accommodation for the Schools of Applied Social Studies, Nursing & Midwifery, and Health Sciences. The building also acts as a hub for student services, with the university's student helpdesk, careers service, disability and dyslexia service, accommodation office and counselling service located in facilities off the main atrium. The building comprises seven storeys, six of which are currently in use with the smaller seventh (top) level left unoccupied as an equipment/plant space and in case future expansion is required. Like the Business School building, it takes the form of a stepped-box set partially into the hillside with a curved roof stretching to the ground, with the main entrance on Level 4 and a full-height atrium dominating the centre of the building. Raised ""bridges"" connecting the two sides of the atrium on each floor serve as staff recreation areas. Department and staff offices are on the east side of the building with classrooms on the west side, all with windows onto the atrium or campus parkland, while below ground are located teaching facilities for nursing and other health professions. These include a simulated hospital environment, as well as teaching and research facilities for radiography, occupational therapy, sport science and psychology. A cafe and large canteen are provided on the lowest level where the base of the building meets ground level on the sloping site. The International College (ICRGU) building is a modular two-storey building situated at the rear of RGU:Sport. It was constructed in 2011 to provide additional teaching space for the ""International College at RGU"" (ICRGU). This is a partnership with Navitas, an Australian company which provides courses of study in its own colleges and arranges for students to continue their studies to degree level at various partner institutions in several English-speaking countries. RGU is one of these partner institutions and ICRGU operates as one of Navitas's colleges. Prospective students from around the world who do not have adequate academic grades for admission to mainstream degree programmes at the university can apply to begin their studies at ICRGU, in smaller classes than students in mainstream university classes. ICRGU teaches these students during their first year until they reach the required standard, then at 2nd year they enter mainstream classes at the university in order to continue their studies until they graduate (usually in degree programmes related to business). The temporary building housing ICRGU was constructed in 2011 and has teaching facilities for these 400 students along with the administration and staff offices for the programme; it is not used for mainstream university classes. The modular units from which it is constructed are finished in plastic-coated galvanised steel in a dark red colour. Parking is not provided for students using this building and Aberdeen City Council have given planning permission for it to stand for only five years. After this time, ICRGU will move into the Riverside East building. Other modern buildings on campus (and older buildings that had once been part of the estate) provide for administration, healthcare, student support, a campus nursery for the children of staff and students, religious facilities and limited student accommodation. The campus includes extensive parkland, trees and meadows. Structure. Academic Faculties. Academic activities at the university are divided into three faculties. Each faculty is led by a dean and is sub-divided into various Schools or Departments as follows. There are also numerous administrative departments which support the university's activities. All academic Schools and Departments are based at the main Garthdee campus. Terms and Semesters. For undergraduate and taught postgraduate degree programmes, the Robert Gordon University operates an academic year with two semesters. The first semester runs from late September to the end of January, with 12 teaching weeks before the Christmas vacation, and a three-week examination period in January. The second semester runs from the start of February until June, with 12 teaching weeks broken by a one-week spring break in April, and then a three-week examination period. Undergraduate students have a long summer vacation, while Masters programmes usually use the summer for a supervised research project. Academic staff typically use the long summer break for research and research-related activity. As usual in the UK, PhD students at the university do not adhere to the semester system. Governance and Leadership. Under the terms of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 and ""The Robert Gordon University (Scotland) Order of Council 1993"", the university's governing body comprises a Board of Governors, consisting of 23 governors appointed to exercise the functions of management and control. The official head of the university is the Chancellor, although in practice he or she acts mainly in a ceremonial or symbolic role. At an operational level, most of the day-to-day management and control of the institution is delegated to the Principal and Vice Chancellor (commonly known simply as the Principal). The Board of Governors also delegates functions relating to the overall planning, co-ordination, development and supervision of academic affairs to the university’s Academic Council. Both the Board of Governors and the Academic Council are supported by a wide range of committees. The Principal's Office is based at Garthdee House on the main Garthdee campus but many other administrative departments and staff are based at the Administration Building at Schoolhill in the city centre. Chancellors At Scottish universities, the Principal of the university is its general chief executive and is the administrative head of the institution, second in precedence only to the Chancellor. This means that the day-to-day running and leadership of the university is the responsibility of the Principal. Principal and Vice-Chancellors Academic Standards. Research. RGU is a teaching-focused university (unlike the University of Aberdeen) but significant amounts of research are conducted by its academic and research staff. Much of this is applied research, but basic research is also conducted. The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) assesses the quality of research in UK universities, with the outcomes used to allocate research funding. In RAE 2008, over 70% of research at the Robert Gordon University was classified as being of international quality and 20% rated as internationally excellent or world leading. According to this, the university has world class researchers in allied health professions, computer science, engineering, architecture, accounting and finance, business and management, library and information management, and art and design. The university has three multidisciplinary research institutes which bring together and support researchers in certain themes. Academic staff can apply to join an institute once they have reached a level of seniority. The institutes provide a focus for delivery of research and knowledge transfer as well as for allocating funding. These are the ""Institute for Health & Welfare Research"", the ""Institute for Innovation, Design & Sustainability Research"" and the ""Institute for Management, Governance and Society Research"".  However, significant amounts of research also take place outside these institutes. Some of this is conducted by staff who are not part of any research institute or are too junior to join one, or by PhD students. Others conduct research which does not fit into the remit of any of the institutes. Students and Student Life. As well as full-time and part-time on-campus study, the University provides a range of distance learning facilities over the internet via its virtual learning environment, CampusMoodle. In 2010, approximately 31% of registered students were studying off-campus or required to attend campus only infrequently. The majority of these study part-time (e.g. combining study with employment). However, RGU does not specialise in distance learning in the same way as the Open University or the University of the Highlands and Islands. Student Association and Union. As the forerunner of today's Student Association, a Student Representative Council was first organised at Robert Gordon's Technical College in 1931, with activities such as sports clubs and societies following in the 1940s. A Student Union building opening in 1952 at Rubislaw Terrace in the city's West End. In 1969, the shop and bakery next to Gray's School of Art (now the Administration Building) on the Schoolhill came on the market and were purchased by Robert Gordon's Institute of Technology; the current Student Union opened there in 1974. Today, the university's Student Association (as an organisation) is directed by an Executive Board, comprising student officers who are elected every March. One purpose of the Student Association is to campaign for the interests of students at all levels of the university's governance, as well as other campaigns designed to achieve specific aims identified by the elected student officers. Campaigns in the 2011-12 academic year included ""I Love My Lecturer"", a program designed to recognise excellent teaching at the university, as well as programs highlighting mental health needs among students and encouraging reduced usage of energy at halls of residence. The Student Association also manages a range of services and promotes opportunities for RGU students, including managing the sports clubs and other societies which are affiliated with it. In 2011-12 there were over 40 student societies at RGU and 32 student sports clubs. The RGU Student Association is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS) and as a result RGU students are eligible to apply for discount schemes operated by the NUS such as the ""NUS Extra"" card. The Student Association currently operates a Student Union building at Schoolhill in the city centre. It contains various bars, a cafe which is open until 8pm on weekdays during term time, as well as various meeting rooms. There are also some minor facilities at the main Garthdee campus, including a shop and small games room. As the University of Aberdeen no longer operates a dedicated Student Union building with a bar (other than a small Hall of Residence bar and a larger on-campus student centre that does not serve alcohol), the RGU:Union is the only Student Union serving alcohol in Aberdeen city-centre. However, students of the University of Aberdeen are able to make use of the RGU:Union as it is open to any student from any university on production of a valid university-issued ID card. Accommodation. The university's Accommodation Services department arranges for students to be placed in one of nine halls of residence across the city, with over 1500 beds available. First-year students receive priority and to make sure all first-year students are housed, in some years applications are not accepted from students who are continuing into a second year of a degree programme. The Accommodation Services department also assists RGU students to find accommodation in the private sector (e.g. sharing a flat or house leased from a private landlord). By far the largest of the halls of residence are the Woolmanhill Flats at St. Andrew Street, close to the university's former St. Andrew Street building which was in use when they were constructed. The Woolmanhill flats have over 700 one-person bedrooms, arranged in self-catering flats of up to eight. All have shared kitchen and lounge facilities, and 600 rooms have shared bathrooms while 136 rooms are ensuite. The Woolmanhill Flats development was constructed in stages the late 1980s and early 1990s by the university working in collaboration with a private developer. The newest hall of residence is the Crathie Student Village on Holburn Street, completed in September 2012 and housing approximately 100 students. Other halls of residence include two buildings on the Garthdee Campus; the Square Tower and the Round Tower. These distinctive pink buildings were constructed in the early 1990s and inspired by traditional Scottish tower houses. They have received architectural acclaim by critics and are included in ""Prospect"" magazine's list of the 100 best Scottish modern buildings. When the list was published in 2005, the Round and Square Towers were the only buildings in Aberdeen to be included. A number of other halls of residence across the city are used, some operated in-house by RGU and others by private companies. These include Rosemount Halls, St. Peter's Halls and Linksfield Halls which were constructed by the University of Aberdeen and then privatised in the early 2000s. Other more modern halls of residence are also used. RGU students also have access to the private halls of residence in Aberdeen which are operated on a commercial basis by specialist companies, such as those owned and operated by the Unite Group. Sports. There are 32 campus sports clubs affiliated with the RGU Student Association, and RGU competes in Scottish Universities Sport (SUS) and British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) competitions. The university timetabling system usually keeps Wednesday afternoons free of classes to allow students to take part in sporting activities, although there are occasional exceptions. A number of elite athletes study at RGU. For example, swimmer Hannah Miley studied at RGU until 2013 and appeared regularly in publicity for the university. A sport scholar program provides support for the athletic and academic careers of developing and elite athletes, including coaching, access to training facilities and financial assistance as well as flexibility in fitting training around the academic timetable. The Robert Gordon University Boat Club also contests the annual Aberdeen Universities Boat Race each Spring against the University of Aberdeen. RGU were victorious in 2012 and 2013, although historically the University of Aberdeen has won more frequently. International Partners. The Robert Gordon University has 2 partner schools in Switzerland: Honorary Graduates. Donald Trump controversy. In 2010, RGU gained international attention for awarding an honorary degree to controversial American businessman Donald Trump. This featured in the 2012 documentary film ""You've Been Trumped"" which documented the progress of the construction of Trump's golf course near Aberdeen from the point of view of local residents. In the film Dr David Kennedy, former Principal of the University, is shown handing back his own honorary degree in protest at the university's action in awarding the degree to Mr Trump. At the time, Dr. Kennedy described the university's decision as 'an insult to decent people everywhere.' "
wikipedia-381865," Satu Mare  Satu Mare (; ; ; ) is a city with a population of 102,400 (2011) and the capital of Satu Mare County, Romania, as well as the center of the Satu Mare metropolitan area. Mentioned in the ""Gesta Hungarorum"" as “Castrum Zotmar”, the city has a history going back to the Middle Ages. Today, it is an academic, cultural, industrial and business centre in northwestern Romania. Geography. Satu Mare is situated in Satu Mare County, in northwest Romania, on the Someş River, from the border with Hungary and from the border with Ukraine. The city is located at an altitude of on the Lower Someş alluvial plain, spreading out from the Administrative Palace at 25 October Square. The boundaries of the municipality contain an area of . From a geomorphologic point of view, the city is located on the Someş Meadow on both sides of the river, which narrows in the vicinity of the city and widens upstream and downstream from it; flooded during heavy rainfall, the field has various geographical configurations at the edge of the city (sand banks, valleys, micro-depressions). The formation of the current terrain of the city, dating from the late Pliocene in the Tertiary period, is linked to the clogging of the Pannonian Sea. Layers of soil were created from deposits of sand, loess and gravel, and generally have a thickness of –. Over this base, decaying vegetation gave rise to podsolic soils, which led to favorable conditions for crops (cereals, vegetables, fruit trees). The water network around Satu Mare is composed of the Someş River, Pârâul Sar in the north and the Homorod River in the south. The formation and evolution of the city was closely related to the Someş River, which, in addition to allowing for the settlement of a human community around it, has offered, since the early Middle Ages, the possibility of international trade with coastal regions, a practice that favored milling, fishing and other economic activities. Because the land slopes gently around the city, the Someş River has created numerous branches and meanders (before 1777, in the perimeter of the city there were 25 meanders downstream and 14 upstream). After systematisation works in 1777, the number of meanders in the city dropped to 9 downstream and 5 upstream, the total length of the river now being at within the city. Systematisation performed up to the mid-19th century configured the existing Someş riverbed; embankments were built long on the right bank and on the left. In 1970, the embankments were raised by –, protecting 52,000 hectares within the city limits and restoring nearly 800 ha of agricultural land that had previously been flooded. Flora and fauna. The flora associated with the town of Satu Mare is characteristic for the meadow area with trees of soft essence like wicker, indigenous poplar, maple and hazelnut. Grassland vegetation is represented by ""Agrostis stolonifera"", ""Poa trivialis"", ""Alopecurus pratensis"" and other types of vegetation. The city's largest park, the Garden of Rome, features some rare trees that are uncommon to the area, including ""Styphnolobium japonicum"", native to East Asia (especially China); ""Pterocarya"", also native to Asia; and ""Paulownia tomentosa"", native to central and western China. Fauna is represented by species of rodents (hamster and european ground squirrel), reptiles, including ""Vipera berus"" in the Noroieni forest, and as avifauna species of ducks, geese, egrets, during passages and systematic occasional wanderings. Climate. Satu Mare has a continental climate, characterised by hot dry summers and cold winters. As the city is in the far north of the country, winter is much more colder than the national average, with an average temperature of , lower than values recorded in other cities in western Romania like Oradea () or Timişoara (). The average annual temperature is , or broken down by seasons: Spring , Summer , Autumn and Winter . Atmospheric humidity is quite high. Prevailing wind currents blow in from the northwest, bringing spring and summer rainfall. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is """" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).  Name. The Hungarian name of the town ""Szatmár"" is believed to come from the personal name ""Zotmar"", as the Gesta Hungarorum gives the name of the 10th-century fortified settlement at the site of today's Satu Mare as ""Castrum Zotmar"". Until 1925, in Romanian, the name ""Sătmar"" was used, which is the Hungarian name transcribed to Romanian orthography. Since 1925, the name of the town in Romanian is officially ""Satu Mare"", which is similar in pronunciation to the original name, and, by popular etymology, conveys meaning in Romanian, namely ""great village"". History. Archaeological evidence from Ţara Oaşului, Ardud, Medieşu Aurit, Homoroade, etc. clearly shows settlements in the area dating to the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. There is also evidence that the local Dacian population remained there after the Roman conquest in 101/106 AD. Later, these lands formed part of Menumorut's holdings; one of the important defensive fortresses dating to the 10th century was at Satu Mare (""Castrum Zotmar"") also mentioned in the ""Gesta Hungarorum"". Soon after Stephen I of Hungary created the Kingdom of Hungary in the year 1000, Teutonic (German) colonists were settled in at the periphery of city (""Villa Zotmar"") who were brought in by Stephen I's wife, the Bavarian princess Gisela of Hungary. Later, they were joined by more German colonists from beyond the Someş River, in Mintiu. A royal free city since the 13th century, Satu Mare changed hands several times in the 15th century until the Báthory family took possession of the citadel in 1526, proceeding to divert the Someş' waters in order to defend the southern part of the citadel; thus, the fortress remained on an island linked to the main roads by three bridges over the Someş. In 1562 the citadel was besieged by Ottoman armies led by Pargalı İbrahim Pasha of Buda and pasha Maleoci of Timişoara. Then the Habsburgs besieged it, leading the fleeing Transylvanian armies to set it on fire. The Austrian general Lazar Schwendi ordered the citadel to be rebuilt after the plans of Italian architect Ottavio Baldigara; using an Italian system of fortifications, the new structure would be pentagonal with five towers. In the Middle Ages, Satu Mare and Mintiu were two distinct entities, but between 1712 and 1715 the two gradually united their administration. On 2 January 1721, Emperor Charles VI recognised the union, at the same time granting Satu Mare the status of royal free city. A decade earlier, the Treaty of Szatmár was signed in the city, ending Rákóczi's War for Independence. The city's importance was linked to the transportation and commerce of salt from nearby Ocna Dejului/Salzdorf, possibly already at a very early date. Due to the economic and commercial benefits it began to receive in the 13th century, Satu Mare became an important centre for craft guilds. In the 18th century, intense urbanisation began; several buildings survive from that period, including the old city hall, the inn, a barracks, the Greek Catholic church and the Reformed church. A Roman Catholic diocese was established there in 1804. In 1823, the city's systematization commission was established in order to direct its local government. In 1844, paving operations begun in 1805 were stepped up. The first industrial concerns also opened, including the steam mill, the brick factory, the Neuschloss Factory for wood products, the lumber factory, the Princz Factory and the Unio Factory. Due to its location at the intersection of commercial roads, Satu Mare (then called ""Szatmárnémeti"") became and important rail hub. The Satu Mare–Carei line was built in 1871, followed in 1872 by the Satu Mare–Sighetu Marmaţiei line, an 1894 link to Baia Mare, 1900 to Ardud and 1906 to Bixad. Since the second half of the 19th century, it underwent important economic and socio-cultural changes. The city's large companies (the Unio wagon factory, the Princz Factory, the Ardeleana textile enterprise, the Freund petroleum refinery, the brick factory and the furniture factory) prospered in this period, and the city invested heavily in communication lines, schools, hospitals, public works and public parks. The banking and commerce system also developed: in 1929 the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as the commodities stock market were established, with 25 commercial enterprises and 75 industrial and production firms as members. In 1930 there were 33 banks. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, Romanian troops captured the town during their offensive launched on April 15, 1919. The Treaty of Trianon recognised the Union of Transylvania with Romania and Satu Mare officially ceased to be part of Hungary becoming part of the Romania. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award gave back Northern Transylvania, including Satu Mare, to Hungary. In October 1944, the city was captured by the Soviet Red Army. After 1945, the city became again part of Romania. Soon afterwards, a Communist regime came to power, lasting until the 1989 revolution. Jewish community. The presence of Jews in Transylvania is first mentioned in the late 16th century. In the 17th century, prince Gabriel Bethlen permitted Sephardi Jews from Turkey to settle in the Transylvanian capital Alba Iulia in 1623. In the early 18th century, Jews were allowed to settle in Satu Mare. Some of them became involved in large-scale agriculture, becoming landlords or lessees or were active in trade and industry, or distilled brandy and leased taverns on crown estates. In 1715, when Satu Mare became a royal town, they were expelled, beginning to resettle in the 1820s. In 1841 several Jews obtained the permission to settle permanently in Satu Mare, the first Jewish community was formally established in 1849, and in 1857, a synagogue was built. After a great number of traditional Ashkenazic Jews had settled in the town, the Jewish community split in 1898, when a supporter of the Hasidic movement was elected chief rabbi, into an Orthodox and a so-called Status Quo community, led by a Zionist rabbi, which erected a synagogue in 1904. In the 1920s, there were several Zionist organizations in Satu Mare, and the yeshiva, one of the largest in the region, was attended by 400 students. In 1930, the city had five large synagogues and about 20 small ones. In 1928, a conflict within the Orthodox community broke out over the election of a new rabbi, lasting six years, ending in 1934 with the appointment of the Hasidic rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, a traditionalist and anti-Zionist, who later refounded the Satmarer Hasidic movement in the Williamsburg, neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Another Hasidic rabbi, Aharon Roth, the founder of the Shomrei Emunim and Toldot Aharon communities in Jerusalem, was also active in Satu Mare.  After Satu Mare was reannexed to Hungary in 1940, the civil rights and economic activities of the Jews were restricted, and in summer 1941, ""foreign"" Jews were deported to Kamenets-Podolski, where they were murdered by Hungarian and German troops. In 1944, the Jewish population was forced into a ghetto, the majority of men were sent to forced labor battalions, and the others were deported to the extermination camps in Poland, where the majority of them was murdered by the Nazis. Six trains left Satu Mare for Auschwitz-Birkenau starting May 19, 1944, each carrying approximately 3300 persons. The trains passed through Kassa (Košice) on May 19, 22, 26, 29, 30 and June 1. In total, 18,863 Jews were deported from Satu Mare, Carei and the surrounding localities. Of these, 14,440 were killed. Only a small number of the survivors returned to Satu Mare after the war, but a number of Jews belonging to linguistically and culturally different groups from all parts of Romania settled in the city. The majority of them later emigrated to Israel. By 1970 the town’s Jewish population numbered 500, and in 2011, only 34 Jews remained. In 2004, a Holocaust memorial was dedicated in the Decebal Street Synagogue's courtyard. Aside from the synagogues, two Jewish cemeteries also remain. Among the notable members of the local Jewish community have been historian Ignác Acsády, parliamentary deputies Ferenc Corin and Kelemen Samu, politician Oszkár Jászi, writers Gyula Csehi, Rodion Markovits, Sándor Dénes and Ernő Szép, painter Pál Erdös, and director György Harag. Demographics. The population of Satu Mare is decreasing by an average of 0.78% per year due to migration. According to the census conducted on 20 October 2011, Satu Mare had a population of 94,948, making it the 20th largest city in Romania. As of 2011, the ethnic makeup was as follows: No religious group can claim a majority in Satu Mare, but as of 2002, there was a plurality of Romanian Orthodox believers (48.59%).

Justice system. Satu Mare has a complex judicial organisation, as a consequence of its status of county capital. The Satu Mare Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Satu Mare County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Carei, Ardud, Negreşti-Oaş, Tăşnad and Livada. Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Satu Mare Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals. Satu Mare has its own municipal police force, ""Poliţia Municipiului Satu Mare"", which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city, and operates a number of special divisions. The Satu Mare Police are headquartered on Mihai Viteazul Street in the city centre (with a number of precincts throughout the city) and it is subordinated to the County's Police Inspectorate on Alexandru Iioan Cuza Street.

wikipedia-381878," Draupadi  In the epic Mahābhārata, Draupadi, also known as (Agnijyotsna) (Devanagari: कृष्णा द्रौपदी; approximate pronunciation: ) is the ""emerged"" daughter of King Drupada of Panchāla and the wife of the five Pandavas. When Yudhisthira becomes the king of Hastinapura at the end of the war, Draupadi (again) becomes the queen of Indraprastha. She is also variously referred as Kṛṣṇā (or Krishnaa, meaning one of darker complexion), Panchali (meaning one from the kingdom of Panchala), Yajnaseni (meaning one born from a Yajna or fire-sacrifice), Mahabhaartii (great wife of the five descendents of Bharata) and Sairandhri (literally: an expert maid, her assumed name during her second exile in which she worked as Virat kingdom's queen Sudeshna's hair-stylist). She had five sons, one by each of the Pandavas: Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakirti, Satanika, and Srutakarma. She is described in the Mahabharata as being extraordinarily beautiful, unsurpassed by any other woman of her time. Draupadi is one of the Panch-Kanya (The Five Virgins) of the ancient Hindu epic, as is her mother-in-law Kunti. Birth. King Drupada of Panchala had been defeated by the Pandava prince Arjuna on behalf of Drona, who subsequently took half his kingdom to humiliate him. To gain revenge on Drona, he performed a fire-sacrifice (yajña) to obtain a means of besting him. Draupadi emerged as a beautiful dark-skinned young woman together with her sibling Dhrishtadyumna from the sacrificial fire. She was named ""Kṛṣṇā"" for her dark complexion, though she is better known as ""Draupadī"" ""daughter of Drupada"". Draupadi's description. ""Of eyes like lotus-petals and of faultless features endued with youth and intelligence, she is extremely beautiful. And the slender-waisted Draupadi of every feature perfectly faultless, and whose body emitteth a fragrance like unto that of the blue lotus for two full miles around."" and she was so beautiful Marriage to the Pandavas. Drupada intended that Arjuna alone win the hand of his daughter. Upon hearing of the Pandavas' supposed death at Varnavata he set up a swayamvara for Draupadi. The princes vying for Draupadi's hand had to shoot five arrows at a revolving target, while looking only at its reflection in a bowl. Drupada was confident that only Arjuna could accomplish this task. Arriving with his brothers disguised as Brahmins (priests), Arjuna successfully tackled the target, which other kings and prince were unable to accomplish. While in exile, Kunti, mother of the Pandavas often advised her sons that they share everything they have (or obtain through Bhiksha, i.e. alms) equally amongst themselves. Upon returning home with Draupadi, on purpose, Yudhisthira addresses his mother first ""Look mother, what we have brought."" Kunti, unmindful of what Yudhisthira was referring to, unassumingly asked her son to share whatever it is with his brothers. Thus, in order to obey their mother's order all five accepted Draupadi as their wife. When Krishna visits the family, he explains to Draupadi that her unique position as the wife of five brothers results from a certain incident in her previous birth. She was born as Nalayani (daughter of Nala and Damayanti). She had in that lifetime prayed to Shiva to grant her a husband with fourteen desired qualities. Shiva, pleased with her devotion, tells her that it is very difficult to get a husband with all fourteen qualities that she desired. But she was resolute in her wish. Then Lord Shiva grants her wish saying that she would get the same in her next birth with five husbands, she was shocked and asked lord Shiva if it was a boon or curse. Shiva replied back saying ""My child do not get worried, you will regain your virginity each an every morning you take bath, till the end of your life you will live with virginity."" Hence she gets married to brothers each who represents a given quality: The just Yudhisthira for his wisdom of Dharma; The powerful Bhima for his strength that exceeded that of a thousand elephants combined; The valiant Arjuna for his courage and knowledge of the battlefield; the exceedingly handsome Nakula and Sahadeva, for their love. The five Pandava brothers were said to have the fourteen qualities desired by Draupadi in her previous birth. None of Draupadi's children survive the end of the epic. Ashwatthama went to torch the camping tents of the Pandavas at night, but he got confused with the Upapandavas (sons of Draupadi and pandavas) as they looked very similar to their fathers. So instead of torching the camps of Pandavas, he ended up torching the camps of Draupadi's children. Parikshit, grandson of Subhadra and Arjuna, is the sole Pandava descendent who survives, at the end of the Mahabharat battle. Karna at swayamvara. Karna was a suitor for Draupadi at her swayamvara. Unlike most other contenders, he was easily able to wield and string the bow, but as he got up to take part, Draupadi refused him this honor. She refused to be the wife of a suta-putra (a charioteer's son). This insult by Draupadi was one of the reasons for her downfall in the court room after the 'dice game' course. The Pandavas were also present in the swayamvara, disguised as brahmanas. Following the failure of the other princes, Arjuna stepped into the ring and successfully hit the target, winning Draupadi's hand. Karna insulted Draupadi by saying that Pandavas were all like sesame seeds removed from the kernel and she should now find some other worthy husbands. Draupadi was very faithful and loved the Pandavas from the depth of her heart though she had special love for Arjuna who had won her hand. Duryodhana's insult. Indraprastha was built at the site of the Khandava forest. The pride of buildings was the Palace of Illusions and this was where Draupadi took Duryodhana and his entourage. The moment Duryodhana entered the palace he encountered an atmosphere of mystery. A retinue of maidservants appeared through a wall and lined up before the guests. The courtyard was divided in two parts. The surface of one part appeared to ripple like the surface of a lake. The surface of the other part appeared solid as granite flooring and when Duryodhana stepped on the apparently solid part of the courtyard, there was a splash and Duryodhana found himself waist deep in water, drenched from head to foot. When Draupadi's maids saw this from the balcony they were amused. Duryodhana felt extremely insulted that Draupadi and her maids saw his embarrassing predicament. Draupadi's statement of """"andhey ka putra andha"""" meaning ""blind man's (referring to Dhritrashtra) son is blind"" further enraged Duryodhana. (In the original text, the Pandavas laugh with their servants. Draupadi, being a queen, is absent from such a public place as a court. No words are spoken by her. The popular insult of ""blindman's son"" is a later addition). This was the last straw, he swore revenge on her and such a revenge that the Pandavas would fall at his feet begging for mercy. The game of dice. This key incident is often considered to mark a definitive moment in the story of Mahabharata. It is one of the driving reasons that ultimately led to the Mahabharata war, though it cannot be considered the central or most important one. Yudhishthira and his four brothers were the rulers of Indraprastha under the sovereignty of King Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra's son Duryodhana who resided in the capital of the empire Hastinapura was always jealous of his cousins and the wealth they had acquired by building Indraprastha. To take revenge on the Pandavas, his uncle Shakuni came up with a plan and together with his brothers, his friend Karna and maternal uncle Shakuni, they conspired to call on the Pandavas at Hastinapura and win their kingdoms in a game of gambling. Shakuni was skilled at winning by unfair means. The idea was that Shakuni would play against Yudhishthira and win at the gambling table what was impossible to win at the battlefield. As the game proceeded, Yudhishthira lost all his wealth and kingdoms one by one. Having lost all material wealth, he went on to put his brothers at stake one by one and lost them too. Ultimately he put himself at stake, and lost again. All the Pandavas were now the servants of the Kauravas. But for Shakuni, the humiliation of the Pandavas was not complete. He prods Yudhishthira that he has not lost everything yet; Yudhishthira still has Draupadi with him and if he wishes he can win everything back by putting Draupadi at stake. Yudhishthira walks into the trap and to the horror of everybody present, puts Draupadi up as a bet for the next round. But Bhishma and Drona oppose this move recalling that a woman cannot be put at stake even if it is their own wife. However, Yudhishthira ignores their call and puts her at stake much to the ire of Bhishma, who in his frustration breaks his chair. Playing the next round, Shakuni wins. Duryodhana commands his younger brother Dushasana to bring her into the forum, if not forcefully. Dushasana barges into the living quarters of Draupadi, who was ""clad in one piece of attire"" as referring to the sari. Dushasana grabs her by the hair and brings her into the court dragging her by the hair. Now in an emotional appeal to the elders present in the forum, Draupadi repeatedly questions the legality of the right of Yudhishthira to place her at stake when he himself had lost his freedom and as a consequence did not possess any property in the first place. Everybody remains dumbfounded. Bhishma, the patriarch of the Kaurava family and a formidable warrior, has only this explanation to offer to Draupadi – “The course of morality is subtle and even the illustrious wise in this world fail to always understand it.” Duryodhana now commands the Pandavas to strip themselves in the manner of dasa. They obey by stripping off their upper garments. Then to the horror of everybody present, Duryodhana orders Dushasana to disrobe Draupadi and he tries to disrobe Draupadi of her sari. Seeing her husbands unable to help her, Draupadi prays to Lord Krishna to protect her. A miracle occurs henceforward, which is popularly attributed to Krishna but in Vyasa's Mahabharata, Draupadi's saviour is named as Dharma (who could be just morality, the god Dharma, Krishna as the Lord of Dharma, or even Vidura or Yudhishthira, or even a logical paradox of Draupadi's question – did Yudhishthira have the right to stake her when he had already lost himself). As Dushasana unwraps layers and layers of her sari, her sari keeps getting extended. Bhima is furious at Dushasana and says, ""I Bhim, Pandu's son vows until I will tear open Dushasana's chest and drink his blood I will not show my face to my ancestors."" Finally, a tired Dushasana backs off without being able to strip Draupadi. Duryodhana repeatedly challenges Yudhishthira's four brothers to disassociate themselves from Yudhishthira's authority and take their wife back. No one dares to denounce their loyalty to their eldest brother. In order to provoke the Pandavas further, Duryodhana bares and pats his thigh looking into Draupadi's eyes, implying that she should sit on his thigh. In rage Bhima vows in front of the entire assembly that ""one day he will break that very thigh of Duryodhan in battle"". When Dushasana finally stops in his attempt Draupadi vows not to tie her hair until she has decorated it with the blood of Dushasana. Accordingly when Bheema kills Dushasana he brings a handful of Dushasana's blood and colours Draupadi's hair with it. The only Kaurav who objects to the disrobing of Draupadi in the court is Vikarna. Vikarna also appeals the assembly to answer the questions raised by Draupadi but in vain. Finally, the blind monarch Dhritarashtra's conscience is stirred when his wife Gandhari who upon hearing about Drupadi's disrobing comes to the court and counsels him. He intervenes and grants Draupadi three boons. Draupadi in her first boon asks her husbands the Pandavas to be freed from bondage. In her second boon she asks for all the wealth Pandavas lost in the game of dice to be restored to them. when Dhritarashtra asks her to wish for the third boon she refuses by saying that three boons must be bequethed only on brahmanas and that ksyatriyas are fit to receive only two boons. Free from the bondage Bhima immediately proposes to his brothers to slay all Kauravas present then and there itself. Yudhishthira, however, restraints him from taking any action. Shakuni and Duryodhana later convince Dhritarashtra to invite Pandavas for a new game of dice, with modified rules, that the loser would go for 12 years exile and another one year anonymity. Yudhisthira asks Dhritrashtra what his order would be, as Dhritrashtra being the king and elder to their own father, where Dhrithrashtra could not reply anything. Thus, Yudhisthira understanding his intention decides to play another game. It was following the defeat in this new game that Pandavas were sent into exile for 13 years. Abduction of Draupadi by Jayadratha. While the Pandavas were in the Kamyaka forest, they often went hunting, leaving Draupadi in the care of Dhaumya, their priest. At this time Jayadratha, the son of Vriddhakshatra, the husband of Duryodhana’s sister Dussala, passed through Kamyaka forest on the way to Salwa Desa. There he saw Draupadi. Jayadratha then started beseeching her to go away with him and desert her husbands who had fallen upon bad times. Draupadi pointed out that it was wrong to desert one’s spouses when they were in difficulty and then gave him a rather long and deliberately delaying speech on exactly the sort of bad time her husbands would give him on their return. Jayadratha then said “thou canst not frighten us(he was with several other Kings when he saw and abducted Draupadi) now with these threats. We, too, O Draupadi, belong by birth to the seventeen high clans, and are endowed with the six royal qualities.” and was sure that he could beat the Pandavas in battle. Draupadi said “Even Indra himself cannot abduct her for whose protection Krishna and Arjuna would together follow, riding in the same chariot.” And she spoke of the way in which Jishnu (Arjuna) would rout Jayadratha and his armies. She also said, “The warring princes of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, with Janardana at their head, and the mighty bowmen of the Kaikeya tribe, will all follow in my wake with great ardour”. Failing with words Jayadratha tried violence and she called for Dhaumya’s help. Though she pushed him to the ground, he overpowered her and forced her onto his chariot. Meanwhile the Pandavas had finished their hunt and Yudhisthira observed that all the animals were disturbed in one direction and was suddenly overcome by premonitions. So he and his brother climbed their chariots pulled by horses of Saindhava breed and gave chase in the direction of the disturbance. And on learning of their wife's abduction by Jayadratha they rushed towards that host with great fury( like hawks swooping down on their prey. And possessed of the prowess of Indra, they had been filled with fury at the insult offered to Draupadi. But at sight of Jayadratha and of their beloved wife seated on his car, their fury knew no bounds). Then follows the exciting description of a battle in which the five pandavas routed the Sauviras, Ikshwakus, Sivis, and Saindhavas and their armies. Jayadratha in fear ran away, leaving Draupadi behind in all this confusion. Dharmaja urged Bhima to spare Jayadratha’s life for the sake of Dussala and Gandhari, much to the indignation of Draupadi.And that highly intelligent lady said to her two husbands, Bhima and Arjuna with indignation mixed with modesty, 'If you care to do what is agreeable to me, you must slay the chief of the Saindhava clan! That foe who forcibly carries away a wife, and he that wrests a kingdom, should never be forgiven on the battle-field, even though he should supplicate for mercy!'.Thus admonished, it was decided to make him humiliated. Then the two valiant warriors went in search of the Saindhava chief. Bhima and Arjuna caught up with Jayadratha and Arjuna asked him how an unmanly fellow like himself had the guts to take a woman away by force. Thereafter there was more running away than actual fighting and Bhima caught Jayadratha and wanted to kill him. Arjuna reminded him of Dharmaraj(Yudhisthira)’s words, so they brought Jayadratha to their hermitage.After bringing the chained Jayadratha back to the hermitage where he was to declare to be slave of Pandavas and was hence, shaved on his head at five places and then freed.(Book 3: Vana Parva-Draupadi-harana Parva) Kichaka's death. While the Pandavas were leading their normal life in their own disguised form, one day Kichaka, the brother of Sudeshana, and the commander of king Virata’s forces, happened to see the Draupadi. He was filled with lust by looking at her. He asked her to marry him, but Draupadi refuses him saying that she is already married to ‘Gandharvas’, so as not to reveal their true identity as they were in exile. She warns Kichaka that her husbands are very strong and he would not be able to escape death at their hands. Later he forces his sister, queen Sudeshana to help him win Draupadi. Sudeshana orders Draupadi to fetch wine from Kichak's house. Draupadi tries to dissuade the queen from sending her to Kichaka's house but fails. When Draupadi goes to get wine, Kichaka tries to molest her. Draupadi escapes and runs into the court of Virata. Kichaka kicks her in front of all the courtiers including Yudhisthira who was also present in the court at that time. The king being weak in front of Kichaka does not take any action. Draupadi asks about the duties of a king and dharma. Draupadi then curses Kichaka in the court that her husbands ‘Gandharvas’ will surely kill him. However, Kichaka only doubts their whereabouts and asks those present in the court where are they then. Yudhisthira then in disguise of being the king's adviser replies, that they Gandharvas would not come as they want her to forgive Kichaka for the time being. With this the king asks Kichaka to leave for the honour of the court and praises Yudhistira's reply as he himself could not think of anything. Later that night, Pandavas together hatch a plan to kill Kichaka. Khichaka meets her later again and tells her that he is the strongest in that country and she has no way other than to accept him. Draupadi, as per the plan, agrees with him but on condition that none of his friends or brothers should know about their relationship. Kichaka accepts her condition and promises her that he will not let anyone know. Draupadi asks Kichaka to come to the dancing hall at night. Bhima(in the guise of Draupadi) that night in the dancing hall, fights with Kichaka and kills him. (Book 4: Virata Parva, Kichaka-badha Parva) Devotion to Krishna. Perhaps Draupadi’s most exceptional quality was that Shri Krishna considered her his sakhi (friend) and sister. Krishna cut his finger while beheading Shishupal, Draupadi immediately tore off a piece of her sari and bandaged his cut. Krishna said that with this loving act, she wrapped him in debt and he would repay each “thread” when the time came. Indeed, when Draupadi needed Krishna’s protection and fervently prayed for his help, he came to the rescue and gave her unlimited cloth. This is one of the stories of the origin of the Raksha Bandhan festival. Once, while the Pandavas were in exile, Durvasa Muni, who was known for his quick anger, suddenly decided to drop in along with his many thousands of disciples. He would naturally want something to eat for himself and his followers. The bowl that gave unlimited amount of food was with them. But the Pandavas and Draupadi had just eaten. The bowl would provide food for that day only until Draupadi had finished eating.There was no more food left. Fearful of Durvasa’s anger, Draupadi prayed to Krishna. When he appeared, Krishna asked if she had anything to eat because he was hungry. when Drupadi answered that she had nothing Krishna pointed out at the one grain of rice which was stiking to the vessel and asked Drupadi to bring it. He ate that single grin of rice. When Durvasa and his disciples arrived after bathing in the nearby river they were all so full that they did not want anything to eat, and thus left peacefully. Draupadi is an exemplification of bhakti, and she experienced God’s divine presence constantly in her life. When she questioned Krishna about everything that had happened to her, he reassured her: “Soon wilt thou, O Draupadi, behold the ladies of Bharata's race weep as thou dost. Even they, O timid one, will weep like thee, their kinsmen and friends being slain. They with whom, O lady, thou art angry, have their kinsmen and warriors already slain. With Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, at Yudhishthira's command, and agreeably to fate, and what hath been ordained by the Ordainer, I will accomplish all this. Their hour having arrived, the sons of Dhritarashtra, if they do not listen to my words, will surely lie down on the earth turned as morsels of dogs and jackals. The mountains of Himavat might shift their site, the Earth herself might spilt into a hundred fragments, the firmament itself with its myriads of stars might fall down, still my words can never be futile. Stop thy tears, I swear to thee, O Draupadi, soon wilt thou see thy husbands, with their enemies slain, and with prosperity crowning them."" Her Existence And Personality. Draupadi was a multifaceted personality: she could be fiery and angry when the situation called for it, but she still had a compassionate nature. She encouraged people to face life with the same inner strength that she did. For example, after Abhimanyu’s death, she consoled his grieving widow, Uttara, by reminding her of the cause for which Abhimanyu gave his life. She encouraged Uttara to gather her strength for the sake of her and Abhimanyu’s child, whom she was carrying at the time. After the war, Draupadi looked after Gandhari with respect and affection, even though Gandhari’s sons had wronged her in so many ways. Because of her virtuous nature, Draupadi is considered one of the panchakanya, a group of five women who are especially venerated in the Hindu tradition. The other four are: Seeta, the wife of Lord rama; Tara, the wife of Vali who was instrumental in reconciling Rama with Sugreev; Ahalya, Sage Gautam’s wife who was given a blessing of purity from Shri Ram; and Mandodari, the virtuous wife of Ravana who had the courage to speak out against her husband when he abducted Sita. Simply remembering these virtuous women, according to tradition, destroys great sins. Draupadi's description of the Pandavas. Her description of Pandavas to Jayadratha when he abducts her, ""With a complexion like that of pure gold, possessed of a prominent nose and large eyes, and endued with a slender make, that husband of mine is known among people by the name of Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma and the foremost of the Kuru race. That virtuous prince of men granteth life to even a foe that yields. Therefore, O fool, throwing down thy arms and joining thy hands, run to him for thy good, to seek his protection. And that other man whom thou seest with long arms and tall as the full-grown Sala tree, seated on his chariot, biting his lips, and contracting his forehead so as to bring the two eye-brows together, is he,--my husband Vrikodara! Steeds of the noblest breed, plump and strong, well-trained and endued with great might, draw the cars of that warrior! His achievements are superhuman. He is known, therefore, by the name of Bhima on earth. They that offend him are never suffered to live. He never forgetteth a foe. On some pretext or other he wrecketh his vengeance. Nor is he pacified even after he has wrecked a signal vengeance. And there, that foremost of bowmen, endued with intelligence and renown, with senses under complete control and reverence for the old—that brother and disciple of Yudhishthira—is my husband Dhananjaya! Virtue he never forsaketh, from lust or fear or anger! Nor doth he ever commit a deed that is cruel. Endued with the energy of fire and capable of withstanding every foe, that grinder of enemies is the son of Kunti. And that other youth, versed in every question of morality and profit, who ever dispelleth the fears of the affrighted, who is endued with high wisdom, who is considered as the handsomest person in the whole world and who is protected by all the sons of Pandu, being regarded by them as dearer to them than their own lives for his unflinching devotion to them, is my husband Nakula possessed of great prowess. Endued with high wisdom and having Sahadeva for his second, possessed of exceeding lightness of hand, he fighteth with the sword, making dexterous passes therewith. Thou, foolish man, shall witness today his performances on the field of battle, like unto those of Indra amid the ranks of Daityas! And that hero skilled in weapons and possessed of intelligence and wisdom, and intent on doing what is agreeable to the son of Dharma, that favourite and youngest born of the Pandavas, is my husband Sahadeva! Heroic, intelligent, wise and ever wrathful there is not another man equal unto him in intelligence or in eloquence amid assemblies of the wise. Dearer to Kunti than her own soul, he is always mindful of the duties of Kshatriyas, and would much sooner rush into fire or sacrifice his own life than say anything that is opposed to religion and morals."" (Book 3: Vana Parva, Section 268) Polyandry. The marriage of Draupadi with five Pandava men, i.e., polyandry, was not regarded without censure by the society spoken of in the epic. The Indo-Aryan texts almost never mention or allow polyandry, although polygamy was common among men of higher social ranks. Her marriage to five men was controversial. However, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of polyandry, Yudhisthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers). Draupadī's polyandrous marriage seems to have been a historic event; otherwise the author of the ""Mahābhārata"", who is at his wit's end to justify it, would have quietly kept silence about it. ... The ""Mahābhārata"" proceeds to give several fantastic reasons in justification of Draupadī's marriage; only one of them may be given by way of illustration. Draupadī got five husbands in this life because in one of her previous existences she had five times uttered the prayer to God, 'Give me a husband' (Mbh 1:213). also Mbh 1:206:2,27; 1:210:29 for contemporary cultural responses to polyandry. Owing to her marriage to five husbands, Draupadi had to live with each one of them turn-by-turn for one year each. She had the boon to be born virgin every year, and is therefore called an eternal Kanya (a virgin). In the Svargarohana Parva of Mahabharat, during their final journey to heaven, Draupadi and all Pandavas but Yudhisthira fall on their way. The reason for the fall of Draupadi is quoted as she being more doting towards Arjuna than the rest of the brothers. Draupadi always loved Arjuna more because Arjuna was the one who won the swayamvara and was also the close friend of Krishna. Her end. When her husbands retired from the world and went on their journey towards the Himalayas and Indra's heaven, she accompanied them, and was the first to fall on the journey. When Bhim asked Yudhisthir, ""This princess never did any sinful act. Then why is she fallen on Earth?"" Yudhisthir replied, ""Though we were all equal unto her, she had great partiality for Vijayan(Arjuna). She obtains the fruit of that conduct today."" ""Beholding his brothers fallen on the Earth, king Yudhishthira the just said unto that deity of a 1,000 eyes these words: ‘My brothers have all dropped down here. They must go with me. Without them by me I do not wish to go to Heaven, O lord of all the deities. The delicate princess (Draupadi) deserving of every comfort, O Purandara, should go with us. It behoveth thee to permit this."" ""He also beheld the princess of Panchala, decked in garlands of lotuses. Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to question her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to him, ‘This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth, as the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any mother’s womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the wielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was enjoyed by you all."" Draupati as a village goddess. The Draupati Amman cult (or Draupati cult) is a tradition that binds together a community of people in worshipping Draupati Amman as a village goddess with unique rituals and mythologies. Fire walking or theemithi is a popular ritual enacted at Draupati Amman temples. There are lot of temples in Chittoor district of Andhrapradesh, India. There are few processions and festivals which are being done for around 21 days per yeear. The famous festival is in the Village Durgasamudram, Tirupati rural of chittoor district. Draupati temples are located in Durgasamudram, Ramapuram, Pachhikapalam, Srikalahasti, Puttur, Pathakalva, Chandragiri and also in the city of Bangalore. Draupadi as Goddess of Fortune. ""Arjuna is there, and Draupadi is directly the Goddess of Fortune. There was this injunction that wherever Draupadi will be there, there will be no scarcity of food."" Modern interpretations. In the feminist play ""We Are So Different Now"" by Shauna Singh Baldwin (2009), Draupadi, still on earth and unable to go to heaven, talks a modern Indian woman out of committing suicide "
wikipedia-381880," Lord's Cricket Ground  Lord's Cricket Ground, generally known as Lord's, is a cricket venue in St John's Wood, London. Named after its founder, Thomas Lord, it is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and is the home of Middlesex County Cricket Club, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the European Cricket Council (ECC) and, until August 2005, the International Cricket Council (ICC). Lord's is widely referred to as the ""home of cricket"" and is home to the world's oldest sporting museum. Lord's today is not on its original site, being the third of three grounds that Lord established between 1787 and 1814. His first ground, now referred to as Lord's Old Ground, was where Dorset Square now stands. His second ground, Lord's Middle Ground, was used from 1811 to 1813 before being abandoned to make way for the construction through its outfield of the Regent's Canal. The present Lord's ground is about north-west of the site of the Middle Ground. A major redevelopment has been proposed for Lord's which would increase capacity by another 10,000 as well as adding apartments and an ice rink, but has caused controversy in the MCC and has yet to be approved. Early history. The earliest known match played on the current Lord's Cricket Ground was Marylebone Cricket Club v Hertfordshire on 22 June 1814. The oldest cricket fixture at Lord's (i.e., one that continues to this day) is the annual Eton v Harrow match, which was first played on the Old Ground in 1805, and on the present Lord's Cricket Ground in July 1818. Ground. Stands. The current stands at Lord's are as follows (in a clockwise direction): Much of Lord's Cricket Ground was rebuilt in the late 20th century. In 1987 the new Mound Stand, designed by Sir Michael Hopkins, was opened, followed by the Grandstand (by Nicholas Grimshaw) in 1996. Most notably, the Media Centre (by Future Systems) was added in 1998-9 which won The Royal Institute of British Architects Stirling Prize for 1999. The ground can currently hold up to 32,000 spectators. The two ends of the pitch are the Pavilion End (south-west), where the main members' Pavilion is located, and the Nursery End (north-east), dominated by the Media Centre. Pavilion. The main survivor of the Victorian era is The Pavilion with its famous Long Room; this was built in 1889–90 to the designs of architect Thomas Verity. This historic landmark a Grade II*-listed building underwent an £8 million refurbishment programme in 2004–05. The pavilion is primarily for members of MCC who may use its amenities including seats for viewing the cricket, the Long Room and other facilities such as the Long Room Bar, the Bowlers Bar, a members shop etc. For Middlesex matches the Pavilion is open to members of the Middlesex County Club. The Pavilion also contains the dressing rooms where players change, each of which has a small balcony for players to watch the play. In each of the two main dressing rooms are honours boards which commemorate all the centuries scored in Test matches on the Lord’s ground and all instances of a bowler's taking five wickets in a Test innings and ten wickets in a Test match.  The only cricketer to hit a ball over the pavilion was Albert Trott off Monty Noble on 31 July 1899. Old Father Time. Another highly visible feature of the ground is Old Father Time, a weather vane in the shape of Father Time, currently adorning a stand on the south-east side of the field. Media Centre. The Media Centre was commissioned in time for the 1999 Cricket World Cup and was the first all aluminium, semi-monocoque building in the world. It was built and fitted-out in two boatyards and uses boat-building technology. The centre stands above the ground and its sole support comes from the structure around its two lift shafts it is approximately the same height as the Pavilion directly opposite it on the other side of the ground. The lower tier of the centre provides accommodation for over 100 journalists and the top tier has radio and television commentary boxes. The centre’s only opening window is in the broadcasting box used by Test Match Special. The Building was awarded the RIBA Stirling Prize for architecture in 1999. Tavern Stand. The Lord's Taverners, a charitable group comprising cricketers and cricket-lovers, take their name from the old Tavern pub at Lord's, where the organisation's founders used to congregate. The pub no longer exists, and the Tavern Stand now stands on its former site. However, a new pub is open in the grounds with the same name as well as the Members Bar, in the Pavilion. Field. One of the most distinctive and famous features of the Lord's ground is the significant slope across the field. The north-west side of the playing surface is six feet eight inches higher than the south-east side. This slope causes appreciable deviation in bounce of the ball on the pitch, making it easier to move the ball in to right-handed batsmen when bowling from the Pavilion End, and easier to move it away when bowling from the Nursery End. The outfield was notorious for becoming waterlogged and under the chairmanship of the Estates Committee by Maurice de Rohan the whole outfield was relaid over the winter of 2002–2003. The investment (some £2m) was almost immediately repaid by reducing the need to make ticket refunds in rain-affected matches. Grace Gates. One of the features of the ground is the pair of ornamental gates, named in honour of W G Grace. In 1923, the W G Grace Memorial Gates were erected at the St John's Wood Road entrance to the ground. They were designed by Sir Herbert Baker and the opening ceremony was performed by Sir Stanley Jackson, who had suggested the inclusion of the words ""The Great Cricketer"" in the dedication. Cricket usage. Lord's typically hosts two Tests every summer – including the first Test of the summer – plus two One Day Internationals. Lord's also plays host to the finals of the National Village Cricket Competition, the MCC Universities Challenge tournament and The Friends Provident Trophy. Furthermore, two matches in the Twenty20 Cup, but not the competition's finals day, are played at Lord's each season. The oldest permanent fixture at Lord's is the annual Eton versus Harrow match which began in 1805 (Lord Byron played in the 1805 Harrow XI) and celebrated its bicentenary in 2005. The match is always fiercely contested. Since 2000 it has been 55 overs per side, but before that it was declaration and before that it was two innings per side over two days. Eton has the balance of wins, but the victor in the bicentenary year was Harrow. MCC Museum. Lord's is the home of the MCC Museum, which is the oldest sports museum in the world, and contains the world's most celebrated collection of cricket memorabilia, including The Ashes. MCC has been collecting memorabilia since 1864. The items on display include cricket kit used by the likes of Victor Trumper, Jack Hobbs, Don Bradman and Shane Warne, many items related to the career of W.G. Grace; and curiosities such as the stuffed sparrow that was 'bowled out' by Jahangir Khan of Cambridge University in delivering a ball to T.N. Pearce batting for M.C.C on 3 July 1936. It also contains the battered copy of Wisden that helped to sustain E.W. Swanton through his captivity in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. The Museum continues to collect historic artefacts and also commissions new paintings, and work from the ""MCC Young Cricket Photographer"". A recently opened exhibition, which celebrates the life and career of Brian Lara, is especially suitable for children. It contains the Brian Johnston Memorial Theatre, a cinema which screens historical cricket footage for visitors. A visit to the MCC Museum is included in the guided tours of the ground which take place daily. Alternatively, it can be visited on match-days by ticket-holding spectators for a separate charge. Test matches at Lord's. Over one hundred Test matches have been played at Lord's, the first in 1884 when England defeated Australia by an innings and 5 runs. Australia's first win was in 1888 by 61 runs. South Africa played their first Test match at Lord's in 1907 and the ground was the host to an Australia v South Africa Test match in 1912. The West Indies appeared in a Test match at Lord's for the first time in 1928, to be followed by New Zealand (1931), India (1932), Pakistan (1954), Sri Lanka (1984), Zimbabwe (2000) and Bangladesh (2005). The hundredth Lord's Test match was in 2000 v West Indies. As of 25 August 2010 England have played 119 Test matches at Lord's winning 45, losing 28 and drawing 46. Personal achievements by cricketers in Test matches at the ground are recognised with the names of century makers and of bowlers taking five wickets in an innings, or ten wickets in a match, being inscribed on the honours boards in the home and away dressing rooms. England beat Australia at Lord's for the first time since 1934 in the second game of the 2009 Ashes Series. Lord's hosts two Test matches each summer, one match for each visiting team. In 2010, the stadium hosted three Test matches. As well as England's matches against Bangladesh and Pakistan, a Test match between Australia and Pakistan was held at the stadium in July. Lord's was the venue of the 2000th test match when England hosted India from 21 to 25 July 2011. Other sports. A baseball game was held at Lord's during the Great War to raise funds for the Canadian Widows and Orphans Fund. A Canadian team played an American team in a match watched by 10,000 people. Bowls, tennis, archery and several other sports have been played at Lord's in the past, but never rugby or football. Lord's was also one of the venues for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The archery competition took place in front of the Pavilion, with the archers positioned in front of the Allen Stand and the targets placed in front of the Grand Stand. Lord's also houses a real tennis court. Test match records. Partnership Records. All records correct as of 28 August 2010. "

wikipedia-381906," International Cricket Council  The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. The ICC has 107 members: 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 37 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket, and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches), it does not govern domestic cricket in member countries, and it does not make the laws of the game, which remain under the control of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Alan Isaac, the former chairman of New Zealand Cricket, is the President of the Council who succeeded Sharad Pawar, former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The current CEO is David Richardson who succeeded Haroon Lorgat. History. On 15 June 1909 representatives from England, Australia and South Africa met at Lord's and founded the Imperial Cricket Conference. Membership was confined to the governing bodies of cricket within the British Empire where Test cricket was played. West Indies, New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members in 1926, doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. That year it was also agreed to make a change in membership, with election being for; ""governing bodies of cricket in countries within the Empire to which cricket teams are sent, or which send teams to England."" However the United States did not meet these criteria and was not made a member. After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, it was given Test status in 1952, becoming the seventh Test-playing nation. In May 1961 South Africa left the Commonwealth and therefore lost membership.  In 1965, the Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the ""International"" Cricket Conference and new rules adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the Commonwealth. This led to the expansion of the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members. Associates were each entitled to one vote, while the Foundation and Full Members were entitled to two votes on ICC resolutions. Foundation Members retained a right of veto. Sri Lanka was admitted as a Full Member in 1981, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, new rules were adopted and International Cricket ""Conference"" changed its name to the current name, the International Cricket ""Council"". South Africa was re-elected as a Full Member of the ICC in 1991, after the end of apartheid; this was followed in 1992 by the admission of Zimbabwe as the ninth Test-playing nation. Then, in the year 2000 Bangladesh received test status. Location. From its formation the ICC had Lord's Cricket Ground as its home, and from 1993 had its offices in the ""Clock Tower"" building at the nursery end of the ground. The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with England, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pty Ltd – known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco. For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001–2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office whilst protecting their commercial income from tax. The option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through Sport England, to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London – but be given special exemption from paying UK corporation tax on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In August 2005 the ICC moved its offices to Dubai, and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11–1 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour. Whilst the principal driver of the ICC's move to Dubai was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the MCC (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue. Rules and regulation. The International Cricket Council overlooks playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. Even though the ICC doesn't have copyright to the laws of cricket and only the MCC may change the laws, nowadays this would usually only be done after discussions with the game's global governing body, the ICC. The ICC also has a ""Code of Conduct"" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008 the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players. Tournaments and income generation. The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the Cricket World Cup, and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC’s main source of income. In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of USD 12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast event income was USD 285.87 million, including USD 239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of USD 6.695 million in the period. The ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches (Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Super Series played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006. The Champions Trophy 2004 event was referred to in ""Wisden 2005"" by the editor as a ""turkey of a tournament"" and a ""fiasco""; although the 2006 edition was seen as a greater success due to a new format.  The ICC World Twenty20, first played in 2007, was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the Olympic Games, and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin in 2010, one year after the 2009 edition. Umpires and referees. The ICC appoints international umpires and Match referees who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the Elite Panel, the International Panel, and the Associates and Affiliates Panel. As of January 2009, the Elite Panel includes eleven umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, whilst one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire first-class cricket in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 12 Test matches and 15 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days per year. The International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup in order to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiates in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a ""third umpire"" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel. The newest panel of umpires, set up in February 2005, is the Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel. It was designed to offer a pathway to top level umpiring for officials from the ICC's 104 Associate and Affiliate Member countries. As of January 2009, it has 10 members from countries such as Nepal and Fiji. These umpires officiate ODIs between Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments such as the ICC World Cup Qualifier. There is also an Elite Panel of ICC Referees who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases. The Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations as of June 2012, on application of Umpire's Decision Review System universally due to opposition by BCCI .It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries. In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology. Members. The ICC has three classes of membership: Full Members, the ten governing bodies of teams that play official Test matches; Associate Members, the 37 governing bodies in countries where cricket is firmly established and organised but which do not qualify for Full Membership; and Affiliate Members, the 60 governing bodies in countries where the ICC recognises that cricket is played according to the Laws of Cricket. Regional bodies. These regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket: Competitions and awards. The ICC organises various First-Class and One-Day cricket competitions: The ICC has instituted the ICC Awards to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months. The inaugural ICC Awards ceremony was held on 7 September 2004, in London. The ICC Player Rankings are a widely followed system of rankings for international cricketers based on their recent performances. The current sponsor is Reliance Mobile who have signed a deal with the ICC that will last until 2015. Anti-corruption and security. The ICC has also had to deal with drugs and bribery scandals involving top cricketers. Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal bookmaking markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, Lord Condon. Amongst the corruption on which they have reported was that of former South African captain Hansie Cronje who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively). The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced which for example prohibit the use of mobile telephones in dressing rooms. Prior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it. In 2010, 3 Pakistani players, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively. Global Cricket Academy. The ICC Global Cricket Academy (GCA) is located at Dubai Sports City in the United Arab Emirates. The GCA's facilities include two ovals, each with 10 turf pitches, outdoor turf and synthetic practice facilities, indoor practice facilities including hawk eye technology and a cricket specific gymnasium. Rod Marsh has been appointed as the Academy's Director of Coaching. The opening, originally planned for 2008, took place in 2010. ICC Cricket World Program. The International Cricket Council telecasts a weekly program on television called ICC Cricket World. It is produced by Sportsbrand. It is a weekly 30-minute program providing the latest cricket news, recent cricket action including all Test and One-Day International matches, as well as off-field features and interviews Criticism. Sports journalist Peter Della Penna has criticised the ICC for what he has perceived as attempts to minimise reports of security issues relating to unruly fans at matches. "
wikipedia-381909," Polytechnic Institute of New York University  The Polytechnic Institute of New York University, often referred to as NYU Polytechnic, NYU-Poly, or Poly is one of the 18 schools and colleges that comprise New York University (NYU). Founded in 1854, the Institute adopted the European polytechnic university model which tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.; it is the second oldest private engineering and technology institute in the United States. Its laboratory instruction at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry. Its main campus is centrally located in the MetroTech Center, the nation's largest urban university-industry science and technology park. NYU-Poly is MetroTech's founding member. NYU-Poly operates several on-campus and off-campus business incubators and is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace. NYU-Poly is one of the eight schools of NYU that is part of the NYU Entrepreneurs Network (NYUEN). NYU Polytechnic is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a Doctorate-Granting ""Research University"" with very high research activity. Its financial engineering program was the second program of its kind and the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers. It was one of the first universities to introduce a cyber security program and is designated as both a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and a Center of Academic Excellence in Research by the National Security Agency. Polytechnic is the first school in New York City to receive the designation Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the U.S. National Security Agency. The first polymer science and polymer engineering programs in the U.S. began at NYU-Poly. In 1950, the NYU-Poly division of the American Chemical Society was formed, and has since grown to the second-largest division in this association with nearly 8,000 members. Notable people associated with the university include Ernst Weber (first president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and one of the founders of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE)), Herman Francis Mark (Father of Modern Polymer Science), Buddy Ratner (one of the founding fathers of modern bioengineering), Elmer L. Gaden (father of Biomedical Engineering), Samuel L. Greitzer (founding chairman of the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad) and George Bugliarello (founding fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering). History. NYU-Poly was formerly Polytechnic University and it is currently an interim entity that maintains a formal affiliation with NYU, allowing NYU to complete the transition for Poly to become the School of Engineering and Technology within NYU (see NYU Affiliation below). Timeline. The official timeline for the Institute is maintained on Poly at a Glance: the Poly Timeline. Name. Polytechnic Institute of NYU has carried a number of different names. New York University affiliation. In 1973, New York University’s School of Engineering and Science was merged into the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York. The 2008 affiliation between Poly and NYU re-established a formal relationship between New York University and the former Polytechnic Institute of New York after nearly 35 years of separation. The Institute is now an interim entity while it aligns itself to become NYU's dedicated resource for applied sciences and engineering. On August 7, 2007, Polytechnic and New York University (NYU) announced that the two institutions were engaged in merger discussions. In October 2007, NYU’s and Polytechnic's Boards of Trustees both approved continuation of talks on a merger of NYU and Polytechnic. Both institutions decided to continue drafting a Definitive Agreement to more fully define the relationship between the universities. On March 6, 2008, Polytechnic’s Board of Trustees voted to approve the ""Definitive Agreement"" to affiliate with New York University, with the goal that Polytechnic would become NYU's engineering, applied science, and technology school. On June 24, 2008, the New York State Regents approved an affiliation between Polytechnic and NYU by a change of charter which made NYU the sole member of the Polytechnic, effective July 1, 2008. Consolidation into New York University. Polytechnic Institute of NYU is on the path to being consolidated into NYU. This process is expected to be completed sometime before the start of the 2014-15 academic year after which the school will be known as NYU's Polytechnic School of Engineering, similar to that of NYU College of Arts and Sciences, Stern School of Business, Tisch School of the Arts, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, Gallatin School of Individualized Study, and other NYU schools. Campuses. NYU-Poly has its main campus in Downtown Brooklyn and is close to transportation routes and easily accessible from all parts of New York City and Long Island. In addition to its main address at MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, the institute offers programs at other sites throughout the region, including Long Island, Westchester, and Manhattan, as well as several programs in Israel, China and the Middle East. NYU-Poly is an integral part of NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai and the NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) in downtown Brooklyn. Existing campuses. Brooklyn Campus. The Institute played a leadership role in bringing about MetroTech Center, one of the largest urban university-corporate parks in the world and the largest in the United States, while closing down the larger campus at its former Long Island Graduate Center.  Today, the 16-acre (65,000 m²), $1 billion complex in Brooklyn includes the Institute's main campus, along with several technology-dependent companies such as Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC),  as well as New York City Police Department's 911 Center, New York City Fire Department Headquarters and the U.S. technology and operations functions of JPMorgan Chase. In 1998, a Marriott Hotel was built adjacent to MetroTech. MetroTech is often regarded as a ""case study"" in effective university, corporate, government and private-developer cooperation, because it has resulted in renewing an area once characterized urban decay. Wunsch Building houses the school's undergraduate admissions offices and also hosts social, cultural, and academic events for the school and community. The building dates back to 1847 and was the first independent black church in Brooklyn. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad and has been designated a historic landmark since November 24, 1981. The Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology, opened in 1990 in a new building, is Polytechnic's information hub, with many of its offerings accessible online. The Othmer Residence Hall is a 18-story building housing over 400 students and was opened in 2002, and currently houses freshmen and sophomores. It is named for chemical engineering professor Donald Othmer and his wife, Mildred Othmer. The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is a 460,000-square-foot research facility. The Clark Residence, opened in September 2010, offers housing to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. NYU-Poly will build a massive tower on Jacobs Administration and Civil Engineering building site. The developer will be selected in Spring 2013. Long Island Campus. In 1961, Poly opened the Long Island Graduate Center, which grew to several buildings and a dormitory, located on 25 acres of land adjacent to Republic Airport, in Farmingdale. In 2002, the Long Island Graduate Center was closed, and remaining classes were moved to a small portion of a nearby office building in the Melville Corporate Center. The Long Island Graduate Center is only steps away from some big tech companies. It now shares the same building as Agilent Technologies, a maker of electronic test equipment, and is adjacent to the Huntington Quadrangle, which houses InterDigital, a wireless systems designer for cellular networks. The original buildings were later demolished, and replaced by a shopping center. Graduate programs at the Long Island campus have been expanded to include Electrophysics, Systems Engineering, Telecommunication Networks and Wireless Innovation. Westchester Campus. Established in the 1980s, in the Hudson Valley, NYU-Poly's Westchester campus offers several graduate programs and operates similarly to the Long Island Campus. Manhattan site. Located at 2 Broadway in downtown Manhattan, this site offers degree programs in Financial Engineering, Management of Technology, Information Management and Accelerated Management of Technology, and the Exec 21 Construction Management certificate. The Manhattan Graduate Center offers a facility for working professionals. Israel Campus. Located in Rishon LeZion in the College of Management. This campus offers Master of Science in Management and Master of Science in Organizational Behaviour degrees. New York University Abu Dhabi. In October 2007, New York University announced its intention to open a complete branch campus in Abu Dhabi, financed by the Abu Dhabi government. The Abu Dhabi campus was planned by New York University, and the funding mainly came from the Government of the United Arab Emirates. It was first opened in 2008 on a temporary site in downtown Abu Dhabi, and held various public events such as academic conferences, workshops, and performances. It accepted its first class of 150 students in September 2010. As of 2010 the college offered liberal arts and science subjects, including engineering. New York University plans to move the Abu Dhabi campus to a new site by 2014, and plans to increase the number of students at the campus to two thousand. The university plans to open a graduate school and to make the school a center for research. The new campus will be in the Marina district of Saadiyat Island, and is designed by Rafael Viñoly, an Uruguayan architect. NYU-Poly is integrally connected to NYU Abu Dhabi like other schools of NYU and is responsible for NYU Abu Dhabi's engineering programs. Alfred Bloom, former president of Swarthmore College, was appointed to lead NYU Abu Dhabi as vice chancellor in September 2008. New York University Shanghai. NYU Shanghai (NYU-SH) is the latest of NYU's new base campuses, and will have its first class in 2013. The NYU Shanghai curriculum will include a variety of majors in the Life and Behavioral Sciences (such as Neural Science), the Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry and Physics), Social Sciences (including Business and Finance), Mathematical and Engineering Sciences (including Computer Science and Electrical Engineering), and the Humanities. NYU-Poly will be integrally connected like other schools of NYU and will be responsible for NYU Shanghai's engineering programs. As members of NYU's global network, students at NYU Shanghai will be expected to spend at least one semester and up to three semesters pursuing their studies at the other NYU global academic centers. In this way students will have the opportunity to pursue major-specific courses in New York or Abu Dhabi with professors from those campuses. In addition, the study-away sites will offer special opportunities for a semester abroad. Academic profile. The Polytechnic Institute of New York University was established in 1854 as an engineering institute. Currently the Institute has 4652 students and 374 faculty members, giving a 13:1 students to faculty ratio. Cross-school Minors. NYU-Poly is one of the 10 schools of NYU that are eligible for cross-school minoring Student exchange programs. NYU operates programs during the academic year in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Paris, France; and Tel Aviv, Israel. NYU-Poly also has student exchange program with MCI Management Center Innsbruck, École Centrale Paris, Kaiserslautern University of Technology, Dankook University, Sapienza University of Rome, Polytechnic of Bari, Paris Dauphine University and Ajou University. NYU-Poly is also a part of The Global E3 Program, which consists of a consortium of universities working together to provide an excellent study abroad experience for engineering students. Nearly 60 universities worldwide - 31 in the United States and 28 in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East - comprise the Global E3 consortium. This consortium is administered by the Institute of International Education (IIE) in New York, under the guidance of the member-elected Executive Committee. Students from members of this consortium may apply to go to any participating university outside their own country. Accreditation. All undergraduate and graduate programs at Polytechnic are accredited by the Middle States Association. Undergraduate chemistry students have the option to pursue a degree approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS).

wikipedia-381914," Flag of Ontario  The flag of Ontario was enacted by the ""Flag Act"" on May 21, 1965 in the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. The flag is a defaced Red Ensign, with the Union Flag in the canton and the Ontario shield of arms in the fly.  Before 1965, the Canadian Red Ensign had served as the national flag of Canada. It was flown at all military installations in Canada and overseas, outside the legislature and government buildings, at Royal Canadian Legion halls, and many private homes. In 1964, the federal government, after a long and acrimonious debate, replaced the Red Ensign with the current flag of Canada. This decision was unpopular among millions of Canadians. These included many Ontarians, particularly in rural areas that made up much of the political base of Premier John Robarts' Ontario Progressive Conservatives. Robarts thus proposed that Ontario would have its own flag and that it would be a Red Ensign like the previous Canadian flag. It was traditional for jurisdictions around the world with a British system of government and way of life to adapt either a blue or red ensign as a flag, by adding the local coat of arms or some other symbol. In Ontario, it was logical to place the Ontario shield of arms on the flag. While Robarts insisted that he supported the new national flag, he felt the Ensign was an important symbol that reflected Ontario's British heritage and the sacrifices made by Canadian troops under the Red Ensign. As Robarts put it, the Ontario flag ""covers our history."" Canadians were exhausted by the long debate over the national flag and leaders of both the Ontario Liberal Party and the Ontario New Democratic Party decided to support the design for the proposed Ontario flag. The only opposition came from Sudbury Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament Elmer Sopha who was fervently opposed to the flag, arguing that it failed to reflect Ontario's diverse character and that it was ""a flag of revenge"" against the new national flag. However, he was only joined by one other MPP, Liberal Leo Troy, in voting against the flag, and it was passed by the Legislative Assembly on March 17. The flag of Manitoba was adopted under similar circumstances. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed the Ontario provincial flag 43rd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territory flags ranked. "
wikipedia-381917," Space-division multiple access  Space-division multiple access (SDMA) is a channel access method based on creating parallel spatial pipes next to higher capacity pipes through spatial multiplexing and/or diversity, by which it is able to offer superior performance in radio multiple access communication systems. In traditional mobile cellular network systems, the base station has no information on the position of the mobile units within the cell and radiates the signal in all directions within the cell in order to provide radio coverage. This results in wasting power on transmissions when there are no mobile units to reach, in addition to causing interference for adjacent cells using the same frequency, so called co-channel cells. Likewise, in reception, the antenna receives signals coming from all directions including noise and interference signals. By using smart antenna technology and differing spatial locations of mobile units within the cell, space-division multiple access techniques offer attractive performance enhancements. The radiation pattern of the base station, both in transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest gain in the direction of that user. This is often done using phased array techniques. In GSM cellular networks, the base station is aware of the distance (but not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called ""timing advance"" (TA). The base transceiver station (BTS) can determine how distant the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network. The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life for the MS. This is also why having a BTS close to the user results in less exposure to electromagnetic radiation. This is why one may actually be safer to have a BTS close to them as their MS will be powered down as much as possible. For example, there is more power being transmitted from the MS than what one would receive from the BTS even if they were 6 meters away from a BTS mast. However, this estimation might not consider all the Mobile stations that a particular BTS is supporting with EM radiation at any given time. In the same manner, 5th generation mobile networks will be focused in utilizing the given position of the MS in relation to BTS in order to focus all MS Radio frequency power to the BTS direction and vice versa, thus enabling power savings for the Mobile Operator, reducing MS SAR index, reducing the EM field around base stations since beamforming will concentrate rf power when it will be actually used rather than spread uniformly around the BTS, reducing health and safety concerns, enhancing spectral efficiency, and decreased MS battery consumption.

wikipedia-381921," Kippah  A kippah, kippa or kipa ( ; or ; plural: ""kippot"" or ), also known as a hech cap (U.S. only) or a yarmulke ( or from , from the Aramaic meaning ""fear of the King"" (i.e. God)), ""kapele"" (), is a hemispherical or platter-shaped cap, usually made of cloth, worn to fulfill the customary requirement held by some orthodox halachic authorities that the head be covered at all times. It is usually worn by men and, less frequently, by women in Conservative and Reform communities at times of prayer. Jewish law. There is considerable debate among Halachic authorities as to whether or not wearing a kippah at all times is required. According to the Rambam, Jewish law dictates that a man is required to cover his head during prayer, and wearing a head covering outside of the synagogue was originally a custom. According to some authorities, however, it has since taken on the force of law because it is an act of Kiddush Hashem (lit. ""sanctification of the Name"", referring to actions which bring honor to God). The 17th-century authority Rabbi David HaLevi Segal suggested that the reason was to distinguish Jews from their non-Jewish counterparts, especially while at prayer.  Others, including the Taz (commentary to the Shulchan Aruch by Rabbi David Ben Shemuel Halevi, Poland, 1586–1667), held that nowadays wearing a kippah is required according to the strict Halacha. Yet other halachic authorities like Sephardic poskim, the Chida (Rabbi David Yosef Azulai) hold that wearing a head covering is only a ""midat hasidut"", an additional measure of piety. In a recent responsum, former Sefardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovadia Yosef rules that it should be worn to show affiliation with the religiously observant community. The Talmud states, ""Cover your head in order that the fear of heaven may be upon you."" Rabbi Hunah ben Joshua never walked 4 cubits (2 meters) with his head uncovered. He explained: ""Because the Divine Presence is always over my head."". This was understood by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the Shulchan Arukh as indicating that Jewish men should cover their heads and should not walk more than four cubits bareheaded. Covering one's head, such as by wearing a kippah, is described as ""honoring God"". The ""Mishnah Berurah"" modifies this ruling, adding that the ""Achronim"" established it as a requirement to wear a head covering even when traversing less than four cubits, and even when one is standing still, indoors and outside. ""Kitzur Shulchan Aruch"" cites a story from the Talmud (Shabbat 156b) about Rav Nachman bar Yitzchok who might have become a thief had his mother not saved him from this fate by insisting that he cover his head, which instilled in him the fear of God. In many communities, boys are encouraged to wear a ""kippah"" from a young age in order to ingrain the habit. The Talmud also implies that unmarried men did not wear a kippah: Rabbi Hisda praised Rabbi Hamnuna before Rabbi Huna as a great man. He said to him, 'When he visits you, bring him to me. When he arrived, he saw that he wore no head-covering. 'Why do have not have head-covering?' he asked. 'Because I am not married,' was the reply. Thereupon, he Huna turned his face away from him and said, 'See to it that you do not appear before me again before you are married.' 29b The Tanach implies that covering one's head was a sign of mourning: -2 Samuel 15:30: And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went. -Jeremiah 14:3-4: mourns, and their nobles send their lads for water: they come to the pits, and find no water; their vessels return empty; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads. Because of the ground which is cracked, for there hath been no rain in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads. -Esther 6:12: And Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. The argument for the kipa has two sides. The Vilna Gaon says one can make a ""berakhah"" without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an ""midos chassidus"" (""exemplary attribute""). Recently, there has been an effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient responsa from newly published books. According to Rabbi Isaac Klein, a Conservative Jew ought to cover his head when in the synagogue, at prayer or sacred study, when engaging in a ritual act, and when eating. In the mid-19th century, Reformers led by Isaac Wise completely rejected the ""kippot"" after an altercation in which Rabbi Wise's kippah was knocked off his head. Types and variation. In the Middle Ages in Europe, the distinctive Jewish headgear was the Jewish hat, a full hat with a brim and a central point or stalk. Originally used by choice among Jews to distinguish themselves, it was later made compulsory in some places by Christian governments as a discriminatory measure. In the early 19th century in the United States, rabbis often wore a scholar's cap (large saucer-shaped caps of cloth, like a beret) or a Chinese skullcap. Other Jews of this era wore black pillbox-shaped ""kippot"". Often the color and fabric of the ""kippah"" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. Knitted or crocheted ""kippot"", known as ""kippot serugot"", tend to be worn by Religious Zionists and the Modern Orthodox, who also wear suede or leather ""kippot"". Members of most Haredi groups usually wear black velvet or cloth kippot. In general, the larger the ""kippah"", the more traditional the wearer tends to be. By contrast, the smaller the kippah, the more modern and liberal the person is. More recently, ""kippot"" have been observed made in the colors of sports teams, especially football. In the United States, children's ""kippot"" with cartoon characters or themes such as ""Star Wars"" are popular. (In response to this trend, some Jewish schools have banned ""kippot"" with characters that do not conform to traditional Jewish values.) ""Kippot"" have been inscribed on the inside as a souvenir for a celebration (""bar/bat mitzvah"" or wedding). ""Kippot"" for women are also being made and worn. A special baby kippah has two strings on each side to fasten it and is often used in a ""brit milah"" ceremony. Samaritans once wore distinctive blue head coverings to separate them from Jews who wore white ones, but today they more commonly wear ""fezes"" with turbans similar to that of Sephardi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa. Today, Samaritans do not usually wear head coverings except during prayer, Sabbath and religious festivals. Head coverings in ancient Israelite culture. The Israelites on Sennacherib's marble relief appear with headdress, and although the ambassadors of Jehu on the Shalmaneser stele have head coverings, their costume seems to be Israelite. One passage of the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions חֲבָליִם ""havalim"", which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures of Syrians on Egyptian monuments, represented wearing a cord around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in Arabia. Evidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps then served as protection against irritation from their wigs. The Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the Bedouins, but it is unknown whether a fixed type of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun צַנִיף ""tzanif"" (the verb ""tzanaf"" meaning ""to roll like a ball"", Isaiah 22:18) and by the verb חַבָּש ""habash"" (""to wind"", comp. Ezekiel 16:10; Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites—particularly during and after the Babylonian Exile. In Yemen, the wrap around the cap was called מַצַר ""matzar""; the head covering worn by all women, according to Dath Mosha, was a גַּרגוּש ""gargush"". Kippot in secular law. This story of the ""camouflage kippah"" was retold at many levels, including a keynote speech by President Ronald Reagan to the Baptist Fundamentalism Annual Convention in 1984, and another time during a White House meeting between Reagan and the American Friends of Lubavitch. After recounting the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the religious meaning of the kippah. Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, the leader of the group, responded, ""Mr. President, the kippah to us is a sign of reverence."" Rabbi Feller, another member of the group, continued, ""We place the kippah on the very highest point of our being—on our head, the vessel of our intellect—to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect: the infinite Wisdom of God."" "
wikipedia-381925," Mount Carmel  Mount Carmel (, ""Har HaKarmel"" ISO 259-3 ""Har ha Karmell"" (""lit."" God's vineyard); , ""Kármēlos""; , ""Kurmul"" or جبل مار إلياس ""Jabal Mar Elyas"" 'Mount Saint Elias') is a coastal mountain range in northern Israel stretching from the Mediterranean Sea towards the southeast. The range is a UNESCO biosphere reserve and a number of towns are located there, most notably the city of Haifa, Israel's third largest city, located on the northern slope. Geography and geology. The phrase ""Mount Carmel"" has been used in three distinct ways: The Carmel range is approximately wide, sloping gradually towards the southwest, but forming a steep ridge on the northeastern face, high. The Jezreel Valley lies to the immediate northeast. The range forms a natural barrier in the landscape, just as the Jezreel Valley forms a natural passageway, and consequently the mountain range and the valley have had a large impact on migration and invasions through the Levant over time. The mountain formation is an admixture of limestone and flint, containing many caves, and covered in several volcanic rocks. The sloped side of the mountain is covered with luxuriant vegetation, including oak, pine, olive, and laurel trees. Several modern towns are located on the range, including Yokneam on the eastern ridge, Zikhron Ya'aqov on the southern slope, the Druze communities of Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya on the more central part of the ridge, and the towns of Nesher, Tirat Hakarmel, and the city of Haifa, on the far northwestern promontory and its base. There is also a small kibbutz called Beit Oren, which is located on one of the highest points in the range to the southeast of Haifa. History. Paleolithic history. As part of a 1929–1934 campaign, between 1930 and 1932, Dorothy Garrod excavated four caves, and a number of rock shelters, in the Carmel mountain range at el-Wad, el-Tabun, and Es Skhul. Garrod discovered Neanderthal and early modern human remains, including the skeleton of a Neanderthal female, named Tabun I, which is regarded as one of the most important human fossils ever found. The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest stratigraphic record in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity, from the Lower Paleolithic to the present day, representing roughly a million years of human evolution. There are also several well-preserved burials of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens and passage from nomadic hunter-gatherer groups to complex, sedentary agricultural societies is extensively documented at the site. Taken together, these emphasize the paramount significance of the Mount Carmel caves for the study of human cultural and biological evolution within the framework of palaeo-ecological changes."" As a strategic location. Due to the lush vegetation on the sloped hillside, and many caves on the steeper side, Carmel became the haunt of criminals; Carmel was seen as a place offering an escape from Yahweh, as implied by the Book of Amos. According to the Books of Kings, Elisha travelled to Carmel straight after cursing a group of young men because they had mocked him and the ascension of Elijah by jeering, ""Go on up, bald man!"" After this, bears came out of the forest and killed 42 of them. This does not necessarily imply that Elisha had sought asylum there from any potential backlash, although the description in the Book of Amos, of the location being a refuge, is dated by textual scholars to be earlier than the accounts of Elisha in the Book of Kings, and according to Strabo it had continued to be a place of refuge until at least the first century. According to Epiphanius, and Josephus, Mount Carmel had been the stronghold of the Essenes that came from a place in Galilee named ""Nazareth""; though this Essene group are sometimes consequently referred to as ""Nazareans"", they are not to be confused with the ""Nazarene"" sect, which followed the teachings of Jesus, but associated with the Pharisees. Members of the modern American groups claiming to be ""Essenes"", but viewed by scholars as having no ties to the historical group, treat Mount Carmel as having great religious significance on account of the protection it afforded to the historic Essene group. During World War I, Mount Carmel played a significant strategic role. The (20th century) Battle of Megiddo took place at the head of a pass through the Carmel Ridge, which overlooks the Valley of Jezreel from the south. General Allenby led the British in the battle, which was the turning point in the war against the Ottoman Empire. The Jezreel Valley had played host to many battles before, including the very historically significant Battle of Megiddo between the Egyptians and Canaanites, but it was only in the 20th century battle that the Carmel Ridge itself played a significant part, due to the developments in munitions. Archaeologists have discovered ancient wine and oil presses at various locations on Mt. Carmel. As a sacred location. In ancient Canaanite culture, ""high places"" were frequently considered to be sacred, and Mount Carmel appears to have been no exception; Thutmose III lists a ""holy headland"" among his Canaanite territories, and if this equates to Carmel, as Egyptologists such as Maspero believe, then it would indicate that the mountain headland was considered sacred from at least the 15th century BC. According to the Books of Kings, there was an altar to God on the mountain, which had fallen into ruin by the time of Ahab, but Elijah built a new one. Iamblichus describes Pythagoras visiting the mountain on account of its reputation for sacredness, stating that it was ""the most holy of all mountains, and access was forbidden to many"", while Tacitus states that there was an oracle situated there, which Vespasian visited for a consultation; Tacitus states that there was an altar there, but without any image upon it, and without a temple around it. Elijah. In mainstream Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought, Elijah is indelibly associated with the mountain, and he is regarded as having sometimes resided in a grotto on the mountain. Indeed, one name for Mount Carmel is جبل مار إلياس ""Jabal Mar Elyas"" Mount Saint Elias. In the Books of Kings, Elijah challenges 450 prophets of a particular ""Baal"" to a contest at the altar on Mount Carmel to determine whose deity was genuinely in control of the Kingdom of Israel; since the narrative is set during the rule of Ahab and his association with the Phoenicians, biblical scholars suspect that the ""Baal"" in question was probably Melqart. According to the Bible in 1 Kings 18, the challenge was to see which deity could light a sacrifice by fire. After the prophets of Baal had failed to achieve this, Elijah had water poured on his sacrifice to saturate the altar and then he prayed; fire fell and consumed the sacrifice, wood, stones, soil, and water which prompted the Israelite witnesses to proclaim, ""The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!"". In the account, Elijah announced the end to a long drought; clouds gathered, the sky turned black, and it rained heavily. Though there is no biblical reason to assume that the account of Elijah's victory refers to any particular part of Mount Carmel, Islamic tradition places it at a point known as ""El-Maharrakah"", meaning ""the burning"". Carmelites. A Catholic religious order was founded on Mount Carmel in the 12th century, named the ""Carmelites"", in reference to the mountain range; the founder was a certain ""Berthold"" (who died at an unknown point after 1185), who was either a pilgrim or crusader. The order was founded at the site that it claimed had once been the location of Elijah's cave, above sea level at the northwestern end of the mountain range; this, perhaps not coincidentally, is also the highest natural point of the entire mountain range. Though there is no documentary evidence to support it, Carmelite tradition suggests that a community of Jewish hermits had lived at the site from the time of Elijah until the Carmelites were founded there; prefixed to the Carmelite Constitution of 1281 was the claim that from the time when Elijah and Elisha had ""dwelt devoutly on Mount Carmel"", priests and prophets, Jewish and Christian, had lived ""praiseworthy lives in holy penitence"" adjacent to the site of the ""fountain of Elisha"", in an uninterrupted succession. A Carmelite monastery was founded at the site shortly after the order itself was created, and was dedicated to Mary, in her aspect of ""Star of the Sea"" (""stella maris"" in Latin) - a common medieval presentation of Mary; although Louis IX (of France) is commonly referred to as the founder, he was not, and had merely visited it in 1252. The Carmelite order grew to be one of the major Catholic religious orders worldwide, although the monastery at Carmel had a less successful history. During the Crusades the monastery often changed hands, frequently finding itself to have become a mosque; under Islamic control, the location came to be known as ""El-Maharrakah"", meaning ""place of burning"", in reference to the account of Elijah's challenge to the priests of Hadad. In 1799 the building was finally converted into a hospital, by Napoleon, but in 1821 the surviving structure was destroyed by the pasha of Damascus. A new monastery was later constructed directly over a nearby cave, after funds were collected by the Carmelite order for restoration of the monastery; the cave, which now forms the crypt of the monastic church, is termed ""Elijah's grotto"" by the monks. One of the oldest scapulars is associated with Mount Carmel, and the Carmelites. According to Carmelite legend, the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was first given to Simon Stock, an English Carmelite, by Mary, the mother of Jesus. The Carmelites sometimes refer to Mary as ""Our Lady of Mount Carmel"", in honour of the legend, and celebrate a feast day dedicated to her in this guise, on the 16 July. Bahá'í Faith. Mount Carmel is considered a sacred place for Bahá'ís around the world, and is the location of the Bahá'í World Centre and the Shrine of the Báb. The location of the Bahá'í holy places has its roots in the imprisonment of the religion's founder, Bahá'u'lláh, near Haifa by the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman Empire's rule over Palestine. The Shrine of the Báb is a structure where the remains of the Báb, the founder of Bábism and forerunner of Bahá'u'lláh in the Bahá'í Faith, have been laid to rest. The shrine's precise location on Mount Carmel was designated by Bahá'u'lláh himself and the Báb's remains were laid to rest on March 21, 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone. The construction of the shrine with a golden dome was completed over the mausoleum in 1953, and a series of decorative terraces around the shrine were completed in 2001. The white marbles used were from the same ancient source that most Athenian masterpieces were using, the Penteliko Mountain. Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, writing in the ""Tablet of Carmel"", designated the area around the shrine as the location for the administrative headquarters of the religion; the Bahá'í administrative buildings were constructed adjacent to the decorative terraces, and are referred to as ""the Arc"", on account of their physical arrangement. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has its largest Israeli mosque on Mount Carmel known as the Mahmood Mosque in Kababir. It is a unique structure composed of two minarets. The mosque was once visited by the President of Israel, Shimon Peres for an Iftar Dinner. "
wikipedia-381930," Operation Sonnenblume  Operation ""Sonnenblume"" (""Sunflower"") was the deployment of German troops (the ""Afrika Korps"") to North Africa in February 1941, during the Second World War. These troops reinforced the remaining Italian forces in Libya after the Italian 10th Army was destroyed by British attacks during Operation Compass. The order for the operation was issued by ""Oberkommando der Wehrmacht"" (OKW; Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) to ""Oberkommando des Heeres"" (OKH; Army High Command) and ""Oberkommando der Luftwaffe"" (OKL; Air Force High Command) on 6 February 1941. Two days later, the first units departed Naples for Africa and arrived on 11 February. On 14 February, the first units of the 5th Light Division (later renamed 21st Panzer Division) arrived in Tripoli, Libya. These units were the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion and Tankhunter Unit 39; they were sent immediately to the front line at Sirte. During the following months, more 5th Light Division units arrived, and in May the 15. ""Panzerdivision"" was embarked for North Africa. 5th Light Division. The 5. ""leichte-Division""s (mot) (5th Light Division) tank regiment—5. ""Panzer-Regiment""—arrived in North Africa aboard two convoys between 8 and 10 March 1941. The regiment—155 tanks strong—consisted of 25 ""Panzer"" Is, 45 ""Panzer"" IIs, 61 ""Panzer"" IIIs, 17 ""Panzer"" IVs, three ""kleine Panzerbefehlswagen""s and four ""Panzerbefehlswagen""s. While the tanks of the regiment were being loaded onto Italian cargo ships in the port of Naples, the cargo ship ""Leverkusen"" caught fire and sank, resulting in the loss of the 10 ""Panzer"" IIIs and three ""Panzer"" IVs on board. Ten replacement ""Panzer"" IIIs—a mixture of Ausf F and G models—were requisitioned from ""6. Panzer-Regiment"", and three newly-built ""Panzer"" IV Ausf Es were shipped to Libya between 10 and 14 April. However, they did not reach the regiment until 29 April. A further 25 ""Panzer"" I Ausf A were shipped over to North Africa to reinforce the regiment arriving in Tripoli on 10 May. The on paper peak strength of the 5th Light Division in North Africa was therefore: All the tanks in ""5. Panzer-Regiment"" were still painted dark grey (RAL 7021 ""dunkelgrau"") and carried the ""3. Panzerdivision""s divisional emblem (inverted Y with two strikes) 15. ""Panzerdivision"". 8. ""Panzer-Regiment"" was previously subordinate to the 10. ""Panzerdivision"" before being reassigned on 18 January to the newly-created 15. ""Panzerdivision"", itself created from the 33. ""Infanteriedivision"". 8. ""Panzer-Regiment"" was shipped across to North Africa in three convoys between 25 April and 6 May 1941. The regiment—146 tanks strong—consisted of 45 ""Panzer"" IIs, 71 ""Panzer"" IIIs, 20 ""Panzer"" IVs, four ""kleine Panzerbefehlswagen""s and six ""Panzerbefehlswagen""s. By 28 May, the entire regiment had assembled at the front. Tank modifications. Following the fighting which had taken place from 1939 through 1940, the ""Heer"" was in the process of increasing the armour thickness to improve protection and survivability on all tank designs. New factory production tanks were built with increased armour thickness. For those tanks already in service, field modifications were made with armoured plates bolted onto the tanks to help increase their armor protection. The majority, but not all, of the tanks from the 5. and 8. ""Panzer-Regiment""s shipped across to North Africa during Operation ""Sonnenblume"" had received these field modifications, though a small number had the added armor from the new factory production run. All tanks which were sent to North Africa were also modified for desert conditions, including improving the engine air cooling circulation, increasing the speed of the radiator and cutting holes into the hatch covers of the rear decks on the tanks.

wikipedia-381937," Tabu search  Tabu search, created by Fred W. Glover in 1986 and formalized in 1989, is a metaheuristic search method employing local search methods used for mathematical optimization. Local (neighborhood) searches take a potential solution to a problem and check its immediate neighbors (that is, solutions that are similar except for one or two minor details) in the hope of finding an improved solution. Local search methods have a tendency to become stuck in suboptimal regions or on plateaus where many solutions are equally fit. Tabu search enhances the performance of these techniques by using memory structures that describe the visited solutions or user-provided sets of rules. If a potential solution has been previously visited within a certain short-term period or if it has violated a rule, it is marked as ""tabu"" (forbidden) so that the algorithm does not consider that possibility repeatedly. Background. Tabu search (TS) is a metaheuristic algorithm that can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems (problems where an optimal ordering and selection of options is desired). Current applications of TS span the areas of resource planning, telecommunications, VLSI design, financial analysis, scheduling, space planning, energy distribution, molecular engineering, logistics, pattern classification, flexible manufacturing, waste management, mineral exploration, biomedical analysis, environmental conservation and scores of others. In recent years, journals in a wide variety of fields have published tutorial articles and computational studies documenting successes by tabu search in extending the frontier of problems that can be handled effectively — yielding solutions whose quality often significantly surpasses that obtained by methods previously applied. A comprehensive list of applications, including summary descriptions of gains achieved from practical implementations, can be found in Recent TS developments and applications can also be found in Tabu Search Vignettes. Basic Description. Tabu search uses a local or neighborhood search procedure to iteratively move from one potential solution formula_1 to an improved solution formula_2 in the neighborhood of formula_1, until some stopping criterion has been satisfied (generally, an attempt limit or a score threshold). Local search procedures often become stuck in poor-scoring areas or areas where scores plateau. In order to avoid these pitfalls and explore regions of the search space that would be left unexplored by other local search procedures, tabu search carefully explores the neighborhood of each solution as the search progresses. The solutions admitted to the new neighborhood, formula_4, are determined through the use of memory structures. Using these memory structures, the search progresses by iteratively moving from the current solution formula_1 to an improved solution formula_2 in formula_4. These memory structures form what is known as the ""tabu list"", a set of rules and banned solutions used to filter which solutions will be admitted to the neighborhood formula_4 to be explored by the search. In its simplest form, a tabu list is a short-term set of the solutions that have been visited in the recent past (less than formula_9 iterations ago, where formula_9 is the number of previous solutions to be stored - is also called the tabu tenure). More commonly, a tabu list consists of solutions that have changed by the process of moving from one solution to another. It is convenient, for ease of description, to understand a “solution” to be coded and represented by such attributes. Types of Memory. The memory structures used in tabu search can roughly be divided into three categories: • Short-term: The list of solutions recently considered. If a potential solution appears on the tabu list, it cannot be revisited until it reaches an expiration point. • Intermediate-term: Intensification rules intended to bias the search towards promising areas of the search space. • Long-term: Diversification rules that drive the search into new regions (i.e. regarding resets when the search becomes stuck in a plateau or a suboptimal dead-end). Short-term, intermediate-term and long-term memories can overlap in practice. Within these categories, memory can further be differentiated by measures such as frequency and impact of changes made. One example of an intermediate-term memory structure is one that prohibits or encourages solutions that contain certain attributes (e.g., solutions which include undesirable or desirable values for certain variables) or a memory structure that prevents or induces certain moves (e.g. based on frequency memory applied to solutions sharing features in common with unattractive or attractive solutions found in the past). In short-term memory, selected attributes in solutions recently visited are labeled ""tabu-active."" Solutions that contain tabu-active elements are banned. Aspiration criteria are employed that override a solution's tabu state, thereby including the otherwise-excluded solution in the allowed set (provided the solution is “good enough” according to a measure of quality or diversity). A simple and commonly used aspiration criterion is to allow solutions which are better than the currently-known best solution. Short-term memory alone may be enough to achieve solution superior to those found by conventional local search methods, but intermediate and long-term structures are often necessary for solving harder problems. Tabu search is often benchmarked against other metaheuristic methods - such as Simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, Ant colony optimization algorithms, Reactive search optimization, Guided Local Search, or greedy randomized adaptive search. In addition, tabu search is sometimes combined with other metaheuristics to create hybrid methods. The most common tabu search hybrid arises by joining TS with Scatter Search, a class of population-based procedures which has roots in common with tabu search, and is often employed in solving large non-linear optimization problems. Pseudocode. The following pseudocode, adapted from, presents a simplified version of the tabu search algorithm as described above. This implementation has a rudimentary short-term memory, but contains no intermediate or long-term memory structures. The term ""fitness"" refers to an evaluation of the candidate solution, as embodied in an objective function for mathematical optimization. codice_1 Lines 1-3 represent some initial setup, respectively creating an initial solution (possibly chosen at random), setting that initial solution as the best seen to date, and initializing an empty tabu list. In this example, the tabu list is simply a short term memory structure that will contain a record of the elements of the states visited. The proper algorithm starts in line 4. This loop will continue searching for an optimal solution until a user-specified stopping condition is met (two examples of such conditions are a simple time limit or a threshold on the fitness score). In line 5, an empty candidate list is initialized. The neighboring solutions are checked for tabu elements in line 7. If the solution does not contain elements on the tabu list, it is added to the candidate list (line 8). The best candidate on the candidate list is chosen in line 11 (generally, solutions are evaluated according to a provided mathematical function, which returns a fitness score). If that candidate has a higher fitness value than the current best (line 12), its features are added to the tabu list (line 13) and it is set as the new best (line 14). At this point, if the tabu list is full (line 15), some elements will be allowed to expire (line 16). Generally, elements expire from the list in the same order they are added. This process continues until the user specified stopping criterion is met, at which point, the best solution seen during the search process is returned (line 20). Example: Traveling salesman problem. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is sometimes used to show the functionality of tabu search. This problem poses a straightforward question - given a list of cities, is there a way to order that list to minimize the distance traveled while still visiting every city. For example, if city A and city B are next to each other, while city C is farther away, the total distance traveled will be shorter if cities A and B are visited one after the other before visiting city C. Since finding an optimal solution to the TSP is an NP-hard task, heuristic-based approximation methods (such as local searches) are useful for devising close-to-optimal solutions. To obtain truly high quality TSP solutions, it is essential to exploit the graph structure of the TSP. The value of exploiting problem structure is a recurring theme in metaheuristic methods, and tabu search is well-suited to make such exploitation possible. A class of strategies associated with tabu search called ejection chain methods has made it possible to obtain high quality TSP solutions efficiently  On the other hand, a simple (naïve) tabu search can be used to find a satisficing solution for the traveling salesman problem (that is, a solution that satisfies an adequacy criterion, although not with the high quality obtained by exploiting the graph structure). First, the search starts with an initial solution, which can be generated randomly or according to some sort of nearest neighbor algorithm. To create new solutions, the order that two cities are visited in a potential solution is swapped. The total traveling distance between all the cities is used to judge how ideal one solution is compared to another. To prevent cycles - i.e., repeatedly visiting a particular set of solutions - and to avoid becoming stuck in local optima, a solution is added to the tabu list if it is accepted into the solution neighborhood, formula_4. New solutions continue to be created until some stopping criterion, such as an arbitrary number of iterations, is met. Once the simple tabu search stops, it returns the best solution found during its execution (the solution with the shortest distance traveled while visiting all cities). "
wikipedia-381956," Koopalings  The , later renamed in Japan and Europe, are a group of seven fictional characters in Nintendo's ""Mario"" franchise. Their individual names are (in order of age, oldest to youngest) Ludwig von Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, Roy Koopa, Iggy Koopa, Wendy O. Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr. and Larry Koopa. They first appeared in the NES game ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and again in the Super NES games ""Super Mario World"" and ""Yoshi's Safari"", and """". Following these appearances, however, they were not seen in any major roles until years after in the Wii game ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"". They were originally conceived as a replacement for recurring appearances of series villain Bowser; series creator Shigeru Miyamoto tasked the designers of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" with creating Koopalings, and the seven best designs were chosen as the basis for the characters. Their names and appearances are based on music, particularly rock and roll. They have made several appearances in other media, most notably in the cartoon ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"", which featured entirely different names for the Koopalings due to them not having official names at the time of its airing. Since ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", they have received positive reception, with critics citing them for adding variety to the series' villains compared to when the series merely featured Bowser multiple times. Critics bemoaned the lack of the Koopalings in many games, commenting on how it has taken more than fifteen years for them to get another major appearance, as well as criticizing Bowser Jr. for replacing them. The Koopalings were originally created to be Bowser's children, as it was mentioned in Japanese ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" instruction books as well as early materials. This portrayal was generally accepted by both Japanese and western gamers and media for a long time. However, their role was slowly retconned when Bowser Jr. made his debut, because they were called subordinates in the Japanese version of """" and Bowser's minions starting in ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"". This has confused the fans about whether the Koopalings are part of the family or not, although series creator Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed that this is currently not the case. According to the North American website for ""New Super Mario Bros. U"", the Koopalings are also siblings.  Concept and creation. The Koopalings were conceived by various game designers who were challenged to come up with new bosses for ""Super Mario Bros. 3""; the favourite drawings loosely based on members of the design team were chosen for the seven Koopalings. Most of the Koopalings are distinguished by their wild punk hairstyles. Though they were not originally given individual names, the localizers at Nintendo of America gave them names based on musicians and celebrities. Iggy's name comes from Iggy Pop; Morton's name comes from Morton Downey, Jr., while the star-shaped mark on his eye resembles KISS guitarist Paul Stanley's makeup; Lemmy's name comes from Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead; Ludwig's name and hairstyle comes from Ludwig van Beethoven; Roy's name comes from Roy Orbison, as do his horn-rimmed glasses; Wendy's name comes from Wendy O. Williams; but while many sources claim Larry was named after the American talk show host Larry King, his name actually comes from U2 drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. The names of the Koopalings in the DiC-made ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" show were made due to the fact that none of the Koopalings had names yet, meaning they received a set of different names. Nintendo of Japan has adopted the use of the Koopalings' first names starting with ""Super Mario World"". Appearances. The Koopalings first appeared in the NES video game, ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", where they each conquer one of seven kingdoms in the Mushroom World, transform their kings into various creatures, and steal their wands. After being defeated, they would again appear in the Super NES video game ""Super Mario World"", where each Koopaling captured a Yoshi egg and lay in wait in a castle in each of the game's seven worlds. They have also made appearances in other ""Mario"" titles, including ""Hotel Mario"", ""Yoshi's Safari"", and ""Mario is Missing!"". Since ""Hotel Mario"", they had been absent in the series until the 2003 Game Boy Advance video game """", where they served as mini-bosses in the last stage. Though they were intended to have appeared in ""Super Princess Peach"", but they were ultimately removed from the game. When Electronic Gaming Monthly brought up the Koopa Kids and why they weren't in the Wii game ""Super Mario Galaxy"", director Yoshiaki Koizumi commented that he didn't feel that they fit in it well. Aside from brief mentions and a cameo appearance of one of the Koopalings in ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl"", they once again were absent in the series until the 2009 release of ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"", acting in a similar capacity to their roles in their first two games. The Koopalings once again returned in ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" as the main villains. Like in the previous ""Mario"" platformers, one of them is fought at the end of each World. The Koopalings made a return in ""New Super Mario Bros. U"" with their own airships and they play the same role as before. In other media. The Koopalings made their first animated appearance in the ""Super Mario"" anime OVAs, released in 1989. In the animated cartoon series ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" produced by DIC Entertainment, the Koopa Kids were given different names based on their given personalities. Their ages are also changed. From oldest to youngest, they are Bully Koopa (Roy), Big Mouth Koopa (Morton), Kooky Von Koopa (Ludwig), Cheatsy Koopa (Larry), Kootie Pie Koopa (Wendy), and Hip and Hop Koopa (Lemmy and Iggy respectively). After this, they appear in the animated cartoon series ""Super Mario World"" with the same names, though they more closely resemble their portrayals in the video games. Aside from their names and personalities, they look slightly different and serve their father King Koopa (as Bowser was called in the series) differently compared to their video game counterparts. Instead of their subordinate role, they act directly as his children, and do things such as seek his attention, and even plot against him. They also appear in the Nintendo Adventure Books and comic books. Voices. Each Koopaling has had three voice actors in different media. Reception. Since their appearance in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", the Koopalings have had mostly positive reception, being referred to by Nintendo as common knowledge of the ""Mario"" series due to their appearance in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"". Their popularity amongst fans led to them being reused for the Super NES sequel, ""Super Mario World"". Nintendo Power listed each Koopaling as one of the reasons to love Nintendo, describing them as some of Nintendo's most beloved villains. They cited their eccentric designs for the quality of their personalities. The Koopalings were named the 19th best Mario villains by GameDaily. GamesRadar editor Henry Gilbert described the battle at the end of each world in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" as a ""special affair""; he also praised them for adding variety to the series compared to ""Super Mario Bros."", which featured Bowser as the last boss of each castle. IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas echoed these sentiments, stating that the Koopalings brought their own looks, mannerisms, and methods of attack. Specifically, he described the battle with Lemmy Koopa in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" as unique and memorable, while also describing Ludwig Von Koopa's battle in ""Super Mario World"" as distinct from the others. In another article he listed the Koopalings as one of the characters he wants in ""Mario Kart 7"", especially Wendy O. Koopa. Fellow IGN editor Jesse Schedeen featured the Koopalings in the ""Big Boss of the Day"" feature, describing them as popular bosses in video games. Joystiq editor James Ransom-Wiley called their reappearance in ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"" a welcome addition, stating that it should boost the quality of the bosses. Fellow Joystiq editor JC Fletcher described them as a draw for ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"" for some fans, also praising the three dimensional designs of the Koopalings. During an interview with ""Super Mario Galaxy"" director Yoshiaki Koizumi, Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that they were hoping for the Koopalings to return in it. Destructoid editor Conrad Zimmerman stated that the Koopalings were his favourite characters from ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and added that with regard to the musical references in the Koopalings' names, he doubted that anything similar would be seen in this day and age. GameSpy editor Ryan Scott listed the Koopalings as one of the reasons why ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" and ""Super Mario World"" were quality video games. He also praised ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"" for the inclusion of the Koopalings. The GameSpy staff listed the Koopalings as some of their favorite bosses, stating that they have much more charm than their ""dopey successor"", Bowser Jr. "
wikipedia-381963," Wario's Woods  ""Wario's Woods"" is a falling block game where the objective is to clear the playing field of monsters by using bombs, arranging them into rows of matching colors. Unlike other puzzle games such as ""Tetris"", where the player directly manipulates the game pieces, the player controls Kinopio/Toad, who moves around the playing field and arranges them after they have fallen. The game was re-released in various forms, first available as a broadcast on the Satellaview from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000; as a collectable, playable item in the 2001 Nintendo GameCube game ""Animal Crossing""; and for purchase as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2006. Gameplay. The objective of ""Wario's Woods"" is to clear the playing field of monsters of varying colors by using bombs of matching color, which are dropped into the field from the top of the screen. In order to do so, the monsters and bombs must be rearranged by the player such that three or more objects of the same color are placed adjacent to one another in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows, with at least one object being a bomb (such rows are called a match). For example, a match may consist of two red monsters and one red bomb, but may also consist of two red bombs and one red monster. When the play field is cleared of all the monsters, the player progresses to the next round, where the initial number of monsters increases. The monsters themselves also begin to vary, ranging from requiring two matches to completely destroy them or can only be cleared in diagonal rows. Unlike other action puzzle games such as ""Tetris"" or ""Puzzle League"" where the player directly manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside the playing field atop the fallen objects. Toad primarily can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as scurrying up stacks to retrieve specific objects or kicking them across the play field. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the play field will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over. The player is also given a pseudo time limit called the ""Time Gauge,"" which switches between Bomb Time and Enemy Time each time it expires, causing the game rules to change. During Bomb Time, Birdo drops bombs into the playing field. During Enemy Time, Wario drops monsters into the playing field and lowers the ceiling, shrinking the available space and making it both harder to arrange objects and easier for the playing field to quickly fill up. Techniques and Bonuses. The player is awarded special advantages for performing various techniques. A chain reaction, which occurs when one match triggers another match, extends Bomb Time and shortens Enemy Time. If the player clears a row that contains five or more objects, a Diamond appears, which when used in a match, automatically removes all monsters that match its color from the playing field. Upon completion of a level, the player is awarded a certain number of coins that decreases each time the Time Gauge expires, for which a continue is awarded each time the player accumulates 30 coins in the NES version, and 50 for the SNES version. Additional Modes. In addition to the main single-player mode, ""Wario's Woods"" offers two play modes: a time attack mode, where single-players complete a number of levels as fast as possible; and a competitive two-player versus mode, where each player races to clear all the monsters from his playing field before the other one does. The players can spawn monsters in their opponent's screen via the techniques mentioned above. The Super NES version gives players the option to play this multiplayer mode against computer-controlled players of increasing difficulty, while the NES version supplies unique boss battles, which are fought in a special variation of its main single-player mode. Story. According to the NES instruction manual, the events of ""Wario's Woods"" were first witnessed in a once peaceful area in the Mushroom Kingdom known appropriately as the ""Peaceful Woods"" where Wario had cast a spell over the forest's inhabitants and manipulated them in order to make them his minions. In an attempt to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, Wario uses his band of monsters to destroy the peace of the forest and as a result, peaceful creatures were no longer welcome in the woods. Toad, who is introduced as the Mushroom Kingdom hero, makes his way to Wario's Woods in order to quiet the sinister lout and win the woods back for the sprites (fairy like beings who kept the peace in Wario's Woods until Wario gained control). With the help of a fairy known as Wanda (who could create bombs) and Birdo (who provided encouragement for Toad), Toad had to rescue the Mushroom Kingdom from Wario's greed and power. Toad's job was to take the bombs and line them up with the enemies of the woods so that Wario's monsters would go down in defeat. If Toad clears enough monster-packed sections of the forest (including various mini-bosses), he'll go up against the mighty Wario himself. After defeating Wario the first time, it is then revealed to Toad that the villain that he had just defeated was a ""False Wario"", and that the real Wario in the meantime had prepared for the final battle by inflating himself to a massive size. Upon defeating the real Wario, the antagonist soon shrinks back to his regular size and is soon chased out of the woods by the victorious Toad; thus, allowing peace to finally be restored to the woods. The ending to the SNES version of ""Wario's Woods"" is slightly different as it instead involves Toad destroying Wario's Castle through the use of a large bomb which as a result causes the castle to go crumbling down and puts an end to Wario's rule and spell over the Mushroom Kingdom and its inhabitants. Re-Releases. Two modified versions of the SNES version of ""Wario's Woods"" were released for the Satellaview, a satellite modem add-on for the Super Famicom. The first version was copyrighted in 1994 and released under the name The Bakushou Version featured personalities from the Japanese radio comedy show, Bakushō Mondai (JA). The second version of ""Wario's Woods"" broadcast for Satellaview was released under the name . It was broadcast from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000, throughout the lifespan of the Satellaview. The game was quite popular and it was rebroadcast at least seven times throughout the tenure of St.GIGA's Satellaview-broadcasting period. The game was also broadcast at least once as one of the Satellaview's special event versions. The NES version of ""Wario's Woods"" is available as collectable item in the 2001 game ""Animal Crossing"" for the Nintendo GameCube, obtained through special means. This version was also one of the first titles available for the Wii Virtual Console, released alongside its launch in North America, Australia and Europe, and on December 12, 2006 in Japan. It is currently available for purchase at the Wii Shop Channel for 500 Nintendo Points. Reception. ""Wario's Woods"" has received lukewarm to favorable reviews. Allgame rated ""Wario's Woods"" 4 stars out of 5 for the NES version, and 3.5 stars out of 5 for the SNES version. Christian Huey, who reviewed the NES version, stated that the controls were ""both surprisingly complex and completely intuitive"" while the gameplay has a ""surprising level of depth,"" and labeled the two-player versus mode as ""an extremely welcome addition to the core game."" Scott Alan Marriott, who reviewed the SNES version, felt that the game ""doesn't quite measure up to the addictiveness of either ""Tetris"" or ""Dr. Mario"","" citing the game's ""extremely awkward"" controls and complicated gameplay. While Marriott appreciated ""that the developers were trying something new,"" he concluded that ""Sometimes when you add things to an already proven formula action puzzle games, you dilute the ingredients that made it a success."" Because ""Nintendo Power"" ceased coverage of NES games starting with its March 1994 issue (the NES version was released in December that year), it only reviewed the SNES version of ""Wario's Woods"", awarding it a score of 3.375 out of 5. The reviews for the Virtual Console release ranged from mixed to positive, applauding the gameplay and depth, but criticizing the choice to release the primitive NES version over the more comprehensive SNES version. Lucas Thomas of IGN awarded the game an 8.0 out of 10, praising the game's unique approach to the puzzle genre and graphics that ""took full advantage of the 8-bit hardware were full of character,"" but recommended ""saving [one's] points for the SNES version, if it becomes available."" Aaron Thomas of GameSpot gave ""Wario's Woods"" a score of 7.0 out of 10, admiring the ""fun, addictive game play"" and ""surprising amount of depth,"" but criticizing the game's repetitive music and poor sound effects, adding that he also prefers the ""ideal"" SNES version. Nintendo Life scored the game 6 out of 10, stating that while the game is fun, ""enjoyment for most will no doubt be short-lived."" "
wikipedia-381965," Tom Byron  Tom Byron (born Thomas Bryan Taliaferro, Jr. April 4, 1961 in Houston, Texas) is an American pornographic actor, director and producer. He is of Italian descent and is an alumnus of the University of Houston. A member of the XRCO and the AVN Halls of Fame, Byron was also voted #20 in AVN's top 50 pornstars of all time. Byron is also co-founder and co-owner of the Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) independent professional wrestling promotion. Acting. Byron first started acting in hardcore films in May 1982, and continued to perform mostly in roles portraying the young schoolboy or ""coming of age"" scenarios, as he resembled a teenager even though he was in his early to mid 20s. He starred alongside the underage Traci Lords in many films including her porn debut in early 1984, ""What Gets Me Hot!"". He was also said to have had an ongoing off-screen relationship with Lords, though he later downplayed their relationship.  He has changed his image several times throughout his career, frequently portraying a clean-shaven, adolescent virgin in his early years in porn. His late 1980s long-haired hard rock persona was no pretense, as Byron was at that time moonlighting as a struggling hard rock musician in Los Angeles with hopes of a legitimate career in music. By the early 1990s, Byron again changed his image and appearance to that of a clean cut ""businessman"" type. In August 2002, Byron announced his retirement from performing to focus on his directing career, but in the fall of 2005, after just three years, he returned to performing in numerous scenes, most notably his ""House of Ass"" series for his own company Evolution Erotica. In February 2007, Byron founded Tom Byron Pictures. In December 2012, Byron announced that he was no longer part of the company and was forming a new company Tom Byron Company  As of 2013, Byron still performs in films and works as an independent producer and social media marketer. Filmography. As of 2013, Byron has appeared in over 2500 porn titles, making him the most credited actor in Internet Adult Film Database His earliest video that can be dated with certainty is ""Anything Goes"" from 1982.

wikipedia-381967," Peon  Peonage (, from Spanish ""peón"" ) is a type of involuntary servitude of laborers (peons) having little control over their employment conditions. Peonage existed historically during the colonial period, especially in Latin America and areas of Spanish rule, as well as in the Southern United States after the American Civil War. Whites used the ""Black Codes"" and other systems to gain the forced labor of African Americans after slavery was abolished. English usage. The English words ""peon"" and ""peonage"" were derived from the Spanish word, and have a variety of meanings related to the Spanish usage, as well as some other meanings.  In addition to the meaning of forced laborer, a ""peon"" may also be a person with little authority, often assigned unskilled tasks; an underling. In this sense, ""peon"" can be used in either a derogatory or self-effacing context.  However, the term has a historical basis and usage related to much more severe conditions of forced labor. There are other usages in contemporary cultures: Peonage. The origin of this form of involuntary servitude goes back to the Spanish conquest of Mexico when conquistadors forced natives to work for Spanish planters and mine operators. Peonage was prevalent in Spanish America especially in the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Peru. It remains an important part of social life, as among the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon.  After the American Civil War, peonage developed in the Southern United States. Poor white farmers and freedmen who could not afford their own land would farm another person's land, exchanging labor for a share of the crops. This was called sharecropping and initially the benefits were mutual. The land owner would pay for the seeds and tools in exchange for a percentage of the money earned from the crop and a portion of the crop. As time passed, many landowners began to abuse this system. The landowner would force the tenant farmer to buy seeds and tools from the land owner’s store, which often had inflated prices. As sharecroppers were often illiterate, they had to depend on the ""books"" and accounting by the landowner and his staff. Other tactics included debiting expenses against the sharecropper's profits after the crop was harvested and miscalculating the net profit from the harvest, thereby keeping the sharecropper in perpetual debt to the landowner. Since the tenant farmers could not offset the costs, they were forced into involuntary labor due to the debts they owed the land owner.  Southern states passed ""Black Codes"" to control the movement of freedmen and to try to gain their labor for planters. They often declared as vagrant someone who was unemployed, even if between jobs. They tried to restrict the movement of freedmen between rural areas and cities, to between towns. Under such laws, local officials arbitrarily arrested tens of thousands of freedmen, and charged them with fines and the court costs of their cases. White merchants, farmers or business owners could pay their debts, and the prisoner had to work off the debt. Prisoners were ""sold"" or leased as forced laborers to owners and operators of coal mines, lumber camps, brickyards, railroads, quarries and farm plantations, with the revenues for their labor going to the states. Thousands of other African Americans were seized by southern landowners and compelled into years of involuntary servitude. Government officials leased falsely imprisoned blacks to small-town entrepreneurs, provincial farmers, and dozens of corporations looking for cheap labor. Black men, women and children were forced to labor without compensation. Their labor was repeatedly bought and sold for decades after the official abolition of American slavery.  Whites were seldom prosecuted for holding black workers against their will in peonage. Southern states and private businesses boomed with this free labor. It is estimated that up to 40% of blacks in the South were imprisoned in peonage in the beginning of the 20th century. Overseers and owners often used severe deprivation, beatings, whippings and other abuse as ""discipline"" against the workers. After the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited involuntary servitude such as peonage for all but convicted criminals. Congress also passed various laws to protect the constitutional rights of Southern blacks, making those who violated such rights by conspiracy, by trespass, or in disguise, guilty of an offense punishable by ten years in prison and civil disability. Unlawful use of state law to subvert rights under the Federal Constitution was made punishable by fine or a year's imprisonment. Until the 1960s, sharecroppers in Southern states were forced to continue working to pay off old debts or to pay taxes. Southern states allowed this in order to preserve sharecropping.  In 1921, Georgia farmer John S. Williams and his black overseer Clyde Manning were convicted in the deaths of 11 blacks working as peons in Williams' farm. Williams was the only white farmer convicted for killing black peons between 1877 and 1966. Because of the Spanish tradition, peonage was still widespread in New Mexico after the US Civil War. Because New Mexico laws supported peonage, the US Congress passed an anti-peonage law on March 2, 1867 as follows: ""Sec 1990. The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in the territory of New Mexico, or in any other territory or state of the United States; and all acts, laws, … made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labour of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void."" The current version of this statute is codified at Chapter 21-I of and makes no specific mention of New Mexico. "
wikipedia-381982," New Romney  New Romney is a small town in Kent, England, on the edge of Romney Marsh, an area of flat, rich agricultural land reclaimed from the sea after the harbour began to silt up. New Romney was once a sea port, with the harbour adjacent to the church, but is now more than a mile from the sea. A mooring ring can still be seen in front of the church. It is the headquarters of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. New Romney is not significantly different in age from the nearby village of Old Romney. However New Romney, now about a mile and a half from the seafront, was originally a harbour town at the mouth of the River Rother. The Rother estuary was always difficult to navigate, with many shallow channels and sandbanks. To make navigation easier two large rocks, one bigger than the other, were placed at the entrance to the main channel. The names of two local settlements, Greatstone and Littlestone, are a reminder of these aids. Another possible explanation for these place-names is a result of the effects of Longshore Drift, which disperses shingle and sand deposits, from west to east, with heavier stones accumulating in the area known as Greatstone, while far smaller shingle is to be found in great quantities at Littlestone. Very fine sand is found further east at neighbouring St Mary's Bay. In the latter part of the thirteenth century a series of severe storms weakened the coastal defences of Romney Marsh, and the Great Storm of 1287 almost destroyed the town. The harbour and town were filled with sand, silt, mud and debris, and the River Rother changed course to run out into the sea near Rye, Sussex. The mud, silt and sand were never entirely removed from the town, which is why many old buildings, especially the church, have steps leading down into them from the present pavement level.  New Romney is one of the original Cinque Ports of England, although its importance declined rapidly during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries after the loss of the harbour.  Archaeological investigations in 2007 during replacement of the town's main drainage have cast new light on the medieval origins and development of the town.“Kent Sites” [http://www.canterburytrust.co.uk/old-site/annreps/pdfs/2005/003.pdf, and “Post Excavation and Research” both in ""Canterbury's Archaeology"", vol. 29 (2004–05).Draper, Gillian, Frank Meddens, ""et al""., ""The Sea and the Marsh: The Medieval Cinque Port of New Romney Revealed through Archaeological Excavations and Historical Research"". PCA Monograph 10. Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd (2009). ISBN: 978-0954293895. [http://www.pre-construct.com/Publications/Romney.htm During World War II a fleet of floating concrete harbour sections (called Mulberry Harbours) were towed across the English Channel to France to aid the Allied landings. One of these harbour pieces remains, embedded in a sandbank just off the coast by Littlestone-on-Sea, and is clearly visible at low tide. Further up the coast during the Pipe Line Under The Ocean, or PLUTO, oil was pumped to France under the English Channel for use by allied troops.  New Romney is the main centre of population on the Romney Marsh. John Southland's Community Comprehensive School, the only secondary school in the area, was renamed The Marsh Academy in August 2007. Like many towns on the marsh it has an impressive Norman church in the centre of town. This church originally stood at the harbourside, and its entrances are several feet below ground level. The church is also notable for the boat hooks still evident on the side walls. New Romney's historic high street has several small and interesting shops. A few businesses closed after the opening of a branch of supermarket chain Sainsbury's, but the town retains much of its character. The former almshouses in West Street are noted historic buildings of Kent; they were founded in 1610 by John Southland, an important local magnate, and rebuilt in 1734. Adjacent to these is Plantagenet House and No 3 Old Stone Cottage, which originated as a single house constructed c. 1300–1350, (Archaeology South East, UCL, report by David Martin, 2004). Researchers think it was originally the home of the Master of The Hospital of St John the Baptist, a large secular establishment. The hospital was operating by c. 1260 and flourished until the close of the fifteenth century (""Victoria History"" and a report by Dr Gillian Draper in the possession of the writer). The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway has a station at the extreme south of New Romney, which as well as being a major tourist attraction is used by pupils commuting to school. The station is about three quarters of a mile south of the historic town centre. To the same distance north is the links golf course at Littlestone-on-Sea. The golf course was a favourite of Denis Thatcher, late husband of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and has been used several times for the qualifying rounds of The Open Championship. New Romney was once serviced by the New Romney and Littlestone-On-Sea railway station which was part of the Lydd Line.  The station was sited halfway between New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea. As built the station had two platforms and a small goods yard with four sidings, a goods shed, cattle dock, coal wharves, end loading dock, water tower and other small buildings. The up platform was rarely used in latter years other than as a livestock loading dock. The station was originally called New Romney & Littlestone with on-Sea being added in October 1888. In 1927 a single line extension was built with an unprotected level crossing to an exchange siding with the adjacent Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway station on the opposite side of the Station Road; it was used to deliver coal to that railway. The signal box was taken out of use in the 1950s and goods service was withdrawn in 1964. The station was closed in 1967 and replaced with a bus service. New Romney is easily accessible by road, sitting astride the A259 (which runs from Dover to Portsmouth). Several bus services run to and through New Romney from Hastings, Folkestone and Ashford. New Romney has two paid-for newspapers, the ""Romney Marsh Herald"" (published by Kent Regional News and Media) and the ""Kentish Express"" (published by the KM Group. Free newspapers for the town include the ""Folkestone and Hythe Extra"", part of the KM Group, and ""yourshepway"", part of KOS Media. The local radio station for New Romney is KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country, and New Romney is also served by the county-wide stations Heart, Gold and BBC Radio Kent. In 1951 the Richard Burton, Roger Livesey, and Honor Blackman film ""Green Grow the Rushes"" was made on location in and around New Romney and in nearby St Mary in the Marsh.  In 1762 Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron named the town of Romney in present-day West Virginia in the United States after the town of New Romney. "
wikipedia-381986," Northwich  Northwich is a town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It lies in the heart of the Cheshire Plain, at the confluence of the rivers Weaver and Dane. The town is about east of Chester and south of Warrington. The area around Northwich has been exploited for its salt pans since Roman times, when the settlement was known as Condate. The town has been severely affected by salt mining with subsidence historically being a large problem. However, recent investment in mine stabilisation is set to change the town with the 'Northwich Vision' being a plan for future development work. History. Early history. During Roman times Northwich was known as Condate, meaning ""the confluence"", probably due to its location at the meeting point of the rivers Dane and Weaver. Northwich can be identified through two contemporary Roman documents. The first of these is the Antonine Itinerary, a 3rd-century road map split into 14 sections. Two of these sections, or Itinerary, mention Condate, namely: ""Itinerary II"" which describes ""the route from the Vallum to the port of Rutupiae"", or the route between Hadrian's Wall in northern England and Richborough on the Kent coast; and ""Itinerary X"" is called ""the route from Glannoventa to Mediolanum"" and details the route between Ravenglass fort, Cumbria and Mediolanum (now Whitchurch, Shropshire). The second document is the 7th-century ""Ravenna Cosmography"". Again this document refers to Condate between the entries for Salinae (now Middlewich, Cheshire) and Ratae (now Leicester, Leicestershire), at the time the capital of the Corieltauvi tribe. The Romans' interest in the Northwich area is thought to be due to the strategic river crossing and the location of the salt brines. Salt was very important in Roman society; the Roman word ""salarium"", linked employment, salt and soldiers, but the exact link is unclear. It is also theorised that this is the basis for the modern word ""salary"". Another theory is that the word ""soldier"" itself comes from the Latin ""sal dare"" (to give salt). ""See History of salt for further details"". There is archaeological evidence of a Roman auxiliary fort within the area of Northwich now known as ""Castle"" dated to AD 70. This and other North West forts were built as the Romans moved north from their stronghold in Chester. The association with salt continues in the etymology of Northwich. The ""wich"" (or wych) suffix applies to other towns in the area - namely Middlewich, Nantwich and Leftwich. This is considered to have been derived from the Norse, ""wic"", for bay and is associated with the more traditional method of obtaining salt by evaporating sea water. Therefore a place for making salt became a wych-house; and Northwich was the most northern of the Wich towns in Cheshire. Medieval to early modern. The existence of Northwich in the early medieval period is shown by its record in the Domesday Book: The manor of Northwich belonged to the Earls of Chester until 1237 when the family line died out. Subsequently Northwich became a royal manor and was given to a noble family to collect tolls in exchange for a set rent. That salt production continued throughout the centuries and can be seen through John Leland's description of the town in 1540: Between 1642 and 1643, during the English Civil War, Northwich was fortified and garrisoned by Sir William Bereton for the Parliamentarians. The salt beds beneath Northwich were re-discovered in the 1670s by employees of the local Smith-Barry family. The Smith-Barrys were looking for coal, but instead discovered rock salt, in the grounds of the family home, Marbury Hall, to the north of Northwich. 19th century. During the 19th century it became uneconomical to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped out and the salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected the town and the surrounding landscape. For example collapses in 1880 formed ""Witton Flash"" as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders which could be jacked up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its Museum which is today located in the town's old workhouse. In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington and started manufacturing soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt as a main raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce ""limebeds"". This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable. The first known swimming baths of Northwich was the Verdin Baths, situated on Verdin Park. It was presented by Robert Verdin in commemoration of the Jublilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. It consisted of a 60ft x 20ft x 6yds 2ft cast iron plunge bath and 5 slipper baths. It was a largely timbered-framed building. As the entrance was approached, the motto ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"" could be clearly seen along the front of the building. Whilst it supplied the needs of many, the accommodation was inadequate for what was required. The old enemy, subsidence, made its presence felt and in 1911 the Baths Committee reluctantly closed it down altogether. It had given pleasure to about 20,000 or more people a year as well as residents who derived health benefits through taking the Brine Baths. The baths was demolished shortly after August 1912 by a contractor from Preston. SOURCE - NorthwichBrineBaths.co.uk The Northwich Public Baths was constructed following subsidence of the Verdin Park swimming pool. The project was sanctioned on 16th September 1913 with a budget of £11,732 over 26 years. It was insured for £10,500. Brunner Mond & Co sanctioned the supply of 10,000 gallons of brine per week. London architect, Mr Franck, who had considerable experience in public baths construction J Ernest Franck was architect in the constructed Hammersmith Baths, Lime Grove, 1907, now a block of flats, was handed the reigns of project management. A great mass of running sand underneath the construction site was discovered and the architect advised that it was necessary for the construction of a ferro-concrete raft under the whole site, at an additional of £3,000. Unforeseen circumstances delayed the opening; World War 1 had presented difficulties to the contractors and they had experienced their own troubles as well as the Council. The Grand Opening Gala took place on Saturday 28th August 1915. The new Moss Farm pool a cost of £1.75 million eventually replaced the Brine Baths which closed its doors on 23rd January 1991. The closure scheduled for 23rd December 1990 was delayed by heating problems at Moss Farm. SOURCE - NorthwichBrineBaths.co.uk Modern development. In 1975 Marbury Country Park was the first area to be reclaimed from dereliction and has become a popular recreational area. In 1987 more land was reclaimed to form Furey Wood and over later years, Cheshire County Council's Land Regeneration Unit reclaimed what is now known as Anderton Nature Park, Witton Flash, Dairy House Meadows, Witton Mill Meadows, and Ashton's and Neumann's Flashes. The area now extends to approximately 323 hectares of public space known as Northwich Community Woodlands. In February 2004 a £28 million programme to stabilise the abandoned salt mines underneath Northwich was begun. The work was funded by the English Partnerships through its Land Stabilisation Programme, introduced to resolve issues associated with unstable mines around England. The four mines identified for work were Baron's Quay, Witton Bank, Neumann's and Penny's Lane. These mines were chosen because their subsidence was causing problems for the town centre. The stabilisation plan involved removing millions of litres of brine from the four mines and replacing it with a mixture of pulverised fuel ash (PFA), cement and salt. The project was completed in late 2007. Following the stabilisation of the mines, Northwich is to be developed in line with the 'Vision for Northwich'. The vision, if completed, will see the old concrete County Council buildings and Magistrates Court demolished and replaced with more modern buildings. Furthermore a Debenhams store is planned to be built at Barons Quay along with a cinema and 40 new shops. Governance. Northwich has been within the county boundaries of Cheshire for a long time. At the time of the Domesday survey (1086) Northwich was in the hundred of Middlewich, but by the 14th century it had become part of the Northwich hundred. This probably happened during the reorganisation of the Hundreds in the 12th century. Northwich has been described as a borough from around 1288, though there is no surviving borough charter. Northwich originally constituted an area of only at the confluence of the Rivers Weaver and Dane. The much larger township of Witton cum Twambrooks lay to the east, Leftwich to the south, Castle Northwich to the south-west, and Winnington to the north-west. The manor of Northwich was granted to the Stanley family, later Earls of Derby in 1484, and stayed in the family's hands until the late 18th century. A local board was founded on 26 June 1863 after the Local Government Act 1858 and it purchased the manor from Arthur Heywood Esq. in 1871. In 1875 the local boards for Northwich and Witton cum Twambrooks were amalgamated, and the resultant district was further extended in 1880 to include the whole of Castle Northwich and parts of Hartford, Winnington and Leftwich. On 10 September 1894 these areas were united as the civil parish of Northwich, served by Northwich Urban District Council. The town was further enlarged in 1936 by the addition of parts of Winnington, Lostock Gralam, Barnton, Leftwich and Rudheath, and again in 1955 when parts of Davenham, Hartford, Rudheath and Whatcroft were added. The Local Government Act 1972 replaced the Urban District Council of Northwich with a new district (later borough) council: Vale Royal. Vale Royal covered areas previously covered by Northwich UDC (Urban District Council), Northwich RDC (Rural District Council), Winsford UDC and parts of Runcorn RDC. Northwich Town Council now has the powers of a parish council and is now made up of five main districts of Leftwich, Northwich, Castle, Winnington and Witton.  Vale Royal Borough Council was abolished on 1 April 2009, and Northwich now falls within the new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester. Between 1885 and 1983 Northwich gave its name to a parliamentary constituency. Northwich was also split between the Tatton and Eddisbury constituencies until the formation of Weaver Vale for the 1997 general election. The seat is currently held by Graham Evans (Conservative). The town coat of arms features the Latin motto """"Sal est Vita"""" meaning """"Salt is Life"""", which can be seen on the town's crest of arms. The town is twinned with Dole in France. Geography. Northwich is situated in the Cheshire Plain at coordinates (53.255, -2.522). The town is between and above mean sea level. Northwich is surrounded by the following civil parishes, starting due north and proceeding in a clockwise direction: Anderton with Marbury, Marston, Wincham, Lostock Gralam, Rudheath, Davenham, Hartford, Weaverham, Barnton. Two rivers meet in the town centre, the Weaver and the Dane. The town is surrounded by undulating pasture. Subsidence and the collapse of underground saltworks has created flashes and there are also local meres - for example, to the north is Budworth Mere and to the north east is Pick Mere. The town is built on Lower Keuper saliferous beds from which salt has been mined. Deposits of alluvium run along the river valleys and cover most of the area of the town. Surrounding the town is deposits of boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel can be found to the north-west. The climate is generally temperate with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean average temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom as is the average amount of sunshine. The average annual rainfall is slightly below the average for the UK. There are few days when snow is lying on the ground, although there are some days of air frost. Demography. The population of Northwich in 1664 has been estimated as 560. The population of Northwich over the last 200 years has been: The 2001 Census shows the population of Northwich to be 19,259. This was composed of 9,761 (50.7%) males and 9,498 (49.3%) females. There were 8,253 households. This makes the average household size 2.32, which is slightly below the national average of 2.36. Economics. Northwich has been described as having a market since at least 1535, when it was described as a market town by Leland, but there is no surviving charter. The town still has a market today, which is earmarked for refurbishment as part of the Northwich Vision plans. The town's economy was dominated by the salt industry. However a list of tolls for goods crossing over Northwich bridge in 1353 shows goods coming into the town, including a wide range of carcasses, fleeces, hides and skins, cloth, fish, alcoholic drinks, cloth, dairy products, building materials, household goods, metals and glass, and millstones. This indicates a much wider economic base to medieval Northwich than just the salt trade. Documentary evidence also exists for a mill from 1332 onwards and there is evidence for more than one mill from 1343. Allied to the extraction of salt was a bulk chemical industry, which became concentrated at the three ICI sites at Winnington, Wallerscote and Lostock. The first industrially practical method for producing polythene was accidentally discovered at the Winnington works in 1933. Bakers Frank Roberts & Sons have been associated with the town since 1887 and continues to be based near the town at Rudheath on the A556. Two of Frank Roberts & Sons's three main business divisions, Roberts Bakery and The Little Treats Co, are based in Northwich and Aldred’s The Bakers, is located in Ilkeston, Derbyshire.  There are many contemporary major employers in nearby Rudheath and Hartford. Based on the 2001 Census, Northwich had 13,928 people aged between 16 and 74. Of these, 8,908 (64.0%) people were categorised as economically active; 4,268 (30.6%) were economically inactive; 455 (3.3%) were unemployed. Culture and community. The town has two key events a year. Over the August Bank Holiday Weekend Northwich Festival is held at Moss Farm Sports Complex. Featuring 4 days of music and sport with the main attraction for the Monday being the UK Strongman-North Competition. The Cheshire Classic Women's Road Race is held every April. Part of British Cycling's National Road Race Series, it is the longest running race on the Women's National calendar. The race has been promoted by local cycling club Weaver Valley CC since 1980 and sees the UK's top riders attending. Previous winners include Dame Sarah Storey, Lucy Garner, Lizzie Armitstead, Nicole Cooke and Mandy Jones.  These events were joined in 2011 by the town's first Medieval Festival, which was staged in Verdin Park over the weekend of August 13 and 14. This event, sponsored by Cheshire West & Cheshire Council as part of their efforts to promote the town centre as a destination, is planned to be an annual happening. The 2011 Northwich Medieval Festival featured The Poor Knights of St Dysmas, God's Company of Tabor, The Freemen of Gwent, and the Knights Hospitallers of the North, as well as the Ya Raqs Eastern Dance Troupe. Northwich Memorial Hall was opened in 1960 but closed for redevelopment in 2013, to be replaced by the controversial Memorial Court Facility. It hosted a range of activities, including the Purple Cactus Comedy Club. The Harlequin Theatre produces six plays each year, and it is also the home of Northwich Folk Club (which has run continuously since 1977). The Regal cinema was closed in 2007 and has been demolished: however there are plans for a new cinema as part of the Northwich Vision redevelopment of Baron's Quay. Northwich has a rich musical history, with a number of locals being part of bands such as Placebo, which provided the soundtrack to the film Cruel Intentions. Tim Burgess from the Charlatans lived in Northwich. The band were originally managed by Steve Harrison from the Omega Music record store in the town.  Northwich has its own fictional hero in the form of the ultimate ghost-hunter, James Boag-Munroe. The creation is the work of local Horror author Stuart Neild. The first novel, titled ""A Haunted Man"", features Boag-Munroe's adventures in the haunted salt mines that run underneath Northwich, combining fact with supernatural fiction. More novels are on the way featuring Northwich and other North West locations as the backdrops to the novels. A Hollywood film and television series is also in development based on the books. Northwich has two local newspapers: the ""Northwich Guardian"", published by Newsquest, and the ""Northwich Chronicle"", published by Trinity Mirror. A radio station, Cheshire FM, covers the mid-Cheshire area including Northwich. Northwich is the home of a non-league football team, Witton Albion. The town has two rugby union sides Northwich RUFC and Winnington Park. The town also has a long standing cycling club, Weaver Valley CC. Weaver Valley CC was set up in 1962 and boasts ex-Pro and ITV commentator Paul Sherwen as a member alongside top domestic rider Alan Kemp. The club competes in road racing, time trialling (with a club 10 time trial every Wednesday night during the Summer), track racing and off-road. The club promotes 3 road races, a series of circuit races in June at Oulton Park and the Cat and Fiddle Hill Climb and Cyclo-Cross in September. The club run leaves Hartford British Legion every Sunday morning. The area also boasts several amateur cricket clubs, including Winnington Park CC, Davenham CC, Weaverham CC, Northwich CC and Hartford CC. Northwich also has a successful competitive swim team - Northwich Swimming Club, first formed in the late 19th century. Landmarks and religious sites. The parish church is known as St. Helen's Witton. It is a Grade I Listed Building. The church initially developed as a chapel of ease associated with the parish of Great Budworth to serve the local community, known as the Chapel of Witton. There is no known date for the creation of this chapel, but it is thought to have existed in the 13th century. None of this building exists in the current church. There is no documentary evidence to indicate the dates of the older parts of the current building. However stones in the fabric of the porch carry inscriptions attributed to ""Ricardus Alkoke Capellanus"". This name matches documents concerning land in Northwich and Lostock Gralam dated 1468, but this cannot be used to date the church accurately. It was not until 7 August 1900 that the parish of Witton (otherwise Northwich) was formed from parts of Great Budworth, Davenham and other surrounding parishes. The present St Wilfrid's (Roman Catholic) church was built in 1866. The current Northwich Methodist Chapel was opened in 1990, but there has been a Methodist presence in the town at least since 1774, when John Wesley laid the foundation stone of the first chapel in the London Road area. The Northwich Union Workhouse opened in 1837 following the Poor Law Amendment of 1834 that standardised the system of poor relief throughout Britain. The building is now the Weaver Hall Museum. The Dock Road Edwardian Pumping Station is a Grade II Listed Building originally built by Northwich Urban District Council in 1913. For over 60 years it was used for pumping sewage from parts of Northwich to the Wallerscote Treatment Works. Before it was built, untreated sewage was discharged directly into the River Weaver, causing widespread pollution. Two swing bridges, Hayhurst Bridge built in 1898, and Town Bridge built in 1899, cross the Weaver at Northwich. The bridges were the first two electrically powered swing bridges in Great Britain and were built on floating pontoons to counteract the mine subsidence. They were designed by Colonel John Saner. The Floatel Northwich was moored on the Weaver near the confluence of the two rivers, but was closed when the owners, The Real Hotel Company plc, went into administration in January 2009. It has since been removed. It was the UK's only floating hotel. Transport. The key historical mode of transport is water. By 1732 the River Weaver was improved from Frodsham Bridge to Winsford Bridge and eventually allowed vessels up to to travel up to Northwich Bridge. The Trent and Mersey Canal, opened in 1775, passed to the north of Northwich because of objections from the trustees of the Weaver Navigation. However, the canal passed salt deposits near the village of Marston, and many of the later salt mines were based along its banks including the Lion Salt Works. The Anderton Boat Lift was opened in 1875 to connect the canal and river systems. It was fully restored in 2002 and now houses a visitor centre. The road system around Northwich can be dated back to the Roman times. The A556 and A559 follow the route of the Roman road that runs from Chester to York. The A556 diverts away from the route of the Roman road following a new route to the south of the town acting as the town's bypass. The Chester to Manchester road became a Turnpike in 1769. The A530, known as King Street, also passes near to the town, and this follows the route of the Roman road that connected Warrington and Middlewich. The old route to Warrington and the north from Middlewich, however, was replaced by a new route through Knutsford, which became a turnpike in 1753. Northwich is connected to the motorway network to the north of the town via the A559 onto the M56 motorway; and to the east of the town via the A556 at Junction 19 of the M6 motorway. The railway came to the town in 1863 when the Cheshire Midland Railway constructed its line from Knutsford. The West Cheshire Railway built its line to Helsby in 1869. Passenger trains from Northwich to Chester via Delamere commenced in 1875. The route through Northwich is now marketed as the Mid-Cheshire line. Northwich railway station, last rebuilt in 1897, is on the line from Chester to Manchester Piccadilly. There are also stations within close vicinity at Greenbank, also on the Mid-Cheshire line, and Hartford (on the West Coast Main Line). There are bus routes between Northwich and a number of local towns, including Weaverham, Hartford, Crewe, Warrington, Kelsall and Chester. Education. Northwich and its surroundings has a number of schools and colleges. Sir John Deane's College is now a sixth form college, but was originally formed as a grammar school in 1557. The school was originally known as Witton Grammar School and was erected close to Witton Chapel. The school moved to its current location, to the south of the town, in 1907-08. There is now also further education available through Mid Cheshire College's London Road Studios. Primary education include:  During the 19th century many new schools were founded and by 1850 twelve 'academies' were recorded in the area. The town is now served by County High School Leftwich, a specialist media arts college, while University of Chester Academy Northwich, a specialist performing arts college and Hartford High School both admit pupils from Northwich. There are also several primary schools in the area. St. Nicholas Catholic High School is also in the local vicinity, and performs well on national exam boards, coming second in the whole of Cheshire.  In November 2005, as part of the Northwich Vision, a refurbishment of the town's railway station included a Centre called ""Zone"" that promotes lifelong learning by offering people the opportunity to access a range of online and taught courses. Twin town. Northwich is twinned with: "
wikipedia-383819," Braniff International Airways  Braniff Airways, Inc. d/b/a Braniff International Airways was an American airline that operated from 1930 until 1982, primarily in the midwestern and southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, and in the late 1970s, Asia and Europe. The airline ceased operations on May 12 and 13, 1982 due to high fuel prices, and competition after implementation of the Airline Deregulation Act in December, 1978. Two attempts were made to resurrect the fabled Texas based glamour line including a Hyatt Hotels backed Braniff, Inc. in 1984, that operated until 1989 and the second attempt Braniff International Airlines, Inc., that operated for one year during 1991 and 1992. History. Paul R. Braniff, Inc.. In 1928, insurance magnate Thomas Elmer Braniff financed and founded an aviation company named Paul R. Braniff, Inc. with his brother Paul Revere Braniff. The airline was initially named Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airways. Service began from Oklahoma City to Tulsa using a 5 passenger Stinson Detroiter single engine aircraft on June 20, 1928. Eventually the small airline operated passenger service between larger cities in Oklahoma. The original Braniff brothers remained a part of the company even as the ownership was repeatedly transferred. Eventually the airline was purchased by the Aviation Corporation (AVCO) holding company, whose other holdings included the predecessors of American Airlines. Braniff Airways, Inc.. The Braniff brothers started a new airline in 1930, named Braniff Airways, Inc. Braniff Airways began service between Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Wichita Falls, Texas, with Lockheed Vega aircraft. Braniff's long-term survival was assured when Paul Braniff, then general manager, flew to Washington, D.C. to petition for the Chicago-Dallas airmail route. The United States Post Office granted Braniff its first airmail route in the wake of the 1934 Air Mail scandal. In 1935 Braniff became the first airline to fly from Chicago, to the U.S.-Mexico border. Paul Braniff left the airline in 1935 to pursue other interests and tour South America for Braniff's eventual service to the region, but Tom Braniff retained control of the carrier and hired Charles Edmund Beard to run day-to-day operations. Beard became President and CEO of Braniff in 1954, and Fred Jones of Oklahoma City remained as Chairman of the Board.  Long and Harmon Airlines Merger. Over the years Braniff acquired other airlines including Long and Harmon Airlines in January, 1935 which took the airline to the far South Texas town of Brownsville as well as Dallas among other Texas points. Douglas DC-2 and World War II Effort. Braniff purchased new Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3 aircraft. Most of its network stayed in the midwestern running north to south in the United States. During World War II the airline leased some aircraft to the United States military, and its facilities at Dallas Love Field that became training sites for pilots and mechanics. Bowen Airlines Merger. Braniff Airways acquired Ft. Worth, Texas, based Bowen Airlines in late 1935. The carrier was headquartered at Ft. Worth's Meacham Field Airport and operated a route system from Chicago to Houston via St. Louis, Springfield, Tulsa and Dallas. From Dallas the airline operated to San Antonio with intermediate stops in Ft. Worth and Austin, Texas. An additional route from Ft. Worth to Houston with an intermediate stop in Dallas was also flown. Bowen did not have any coveted Air Mail Contracts and relied solely on passenger revenue. This was causing a severe financial hardship for the small Texas based carrier. The financial woes caused by the lack of Air Mail Contracts created the necessity for the merger with Braniff. Bowen's slogan was ""From the Great Lakes to the Gulf"" which became the Braniff moniker after the merger was completed. Bowen operated a fleet of Vultee V-1As, Lockheed Vegas and exclusive Lockheed Orions that were built to Bowen's own specifications. Mexico Division and South America. During the 1940s Braniff was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board to serve the Caribbean, Central and South America competing in these regions with Panagra. These routes were served by the new Douglas DC-6s. South American service was once again extended in March, 1950 with service from LaPaz to Asuncion, Paraguay. In May, 1959, service was inaugurated to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Argentine President Juan Perón and his famed wife Evita Peron participated in the festivities at Casa Rosada at Buenos Aires. South American service would be greatly expanded in 1967 with the Braniff acquisition of PANAGRA or Pan American Grace Airways, Inc. Mid Continent Airlines Merger. The acquisition of Mid-Continent Airlines on August 16, 1952 added several cities to Braniff's north-south system. The Mid Continent system incorporation added such destinations as Minneapolis/St. Paul, Sioux City, Sioux Falls in the North, Des Moines, Omaha and St. Louis in the Midwest and finally Tulsa Shreveport and New Orleans in the South. As a result of the merger of the merger Braniff would operate a total of 75 aircraft and employ over 4000 employees including 400 pilots. The airline now ranked 7th in Revenue Passengers carried and 8th in Revenue Passenger Miles and Express Ton Miles among all US certificated air carriers.  In 1939, Braniff had petitioned the CAA for a new route that would connect Minneapolis/St. Paul with Kansas City, Missouri via Des Moines, IA and Rochester, MN. Mid Continent Airlines had also applied for this same route and was ultimately awarded the never before served routing over Braniff. Braniff had also entered into talks with Mid Continent for a possible merger into the Braniff system prior to 1952. However, the discussions between the two companies CEO's did not yield any significant results. The two airline managers did keep the past negotiations in mind which ultimately led to the 1952 merger plan. The Braniff Family. On January 10, 1954, Braniff founder Thomas Elmer Braniff died when a flying boat owned by United Gas crash-landed on the shore of Wallace Lake, 15 miles outside of Shreveport, Louisiana due to icing. According to information from Captain George A. Stevens: ""Mr Braniff was on a hunting expedition with a group of important citizens of Louisiana. They were departing from a small duck hunting lake out of Shreveport in a Grumman Mallard aircraft with no deicing system. The wings iced up and they attempted to land. One of the wings hit cypress stumps and the plane crashed against the shore. It caught fire and all 12 lives aboard were lost."" Paul R. Braniff died later that year of cancer. Tom Braniff's wife Bess Braniff also died in 1954. An only son, Thurman Braniff was killed in a training plane crash at Oklahoma City in 1938, and an only daughter, Jeanne Braniff Terrell, died in 1948 from complications of childbirth. Charles Beard Becomes President. Charles Edmund Beard became the first non Braniff family member to assume the role of President of the airline after Tom Braniff's untimely death in January, 1954. Beard led the airline into the jet age, and was instrumental in transitioning Braniff from a piston powered carrier into a substantially jet powered carrier by 1965, less than a decade after the 1959 introduction of Braniff's first jet, the Boeing 707-227. New Headquarters and Operations Facilities. Braniff opened a new headquarters building at Exchange Park, a high-rise office development within sight of Dallas Love Field in February, 1958. They remained there until the opening of Braniff Place World Headquarters Complex at DFW Airport in 1978.  The airline dedicated a state-of-the-art Maintenance and Operations Base on the East Side of Dallas Love Field at 7701 Lemmon Avenue. The facility contained over 433,000 square feet and was equipped to handle the demands of the jet age. The airline occupied the facility until the late 1980s with the Braniff, Inc., (Braniff II) holding company, Dalfort, remaining in the building until 2001. Supersonic Transport Orders. In April, 1964, Braniff President Charles E. Beard officially put deposits down for two US made Supersonic Transport Aircraft in the amount of 100,000 USD for each aircraft. This would officially give Braniff slots number 38 and 44 when the SST aircraft would begin production.  At the time this deposit was made the SST program was being financed by the US government under an edict from President Kennedy. Three US makers of Boeing, Lockheed and North American were vying for the contract to produce America's first SST. Unfortunately the program would be cancelled under the auspices of the Nixon Administration in the early 1970s. The British/French Concorde would then become the mainstay for high speed jet travel. In 1978 Braniff Chair Harding L. Lawrence would negotiate a unique interchange operation with British Airways and Air France to operate Concorde from DFW to London and Paris via Washington Dulles. Unlike the US SST, Concorde would only carry 100 passengers and its economic viability due to two major fuel crisis during the 1970s since its first flights would cripple the aircraft's sales. Only British Airways and Air France would actually own Concorde aircraft. President Beard noted that the two US SST aircraft that Braniff made the deposits on would be used on the carrier's long range US to Latin America services where the sleek new Boeing 707 was already traversing quite satisfactorily. In addition, to the three airframe designs submitted, General Electric, Curiss-Wright, and Pratt and Whitney would also submit proposals for super high powered turbojet engines capable of moving the massive SST at Mach 3 or 2000 mph. The required four engines would need to be capable of producing 50,000 lbs of thrust and capable of operating at altitudes of up to 70,000 feet and be able to carry 200 passengers. Greatamerica Purchases Braniff. In 1965, Troy Post, Chairman of Greatamerica Corporation, an insurance holding company based in Dallas, Texas, purchased Braniff and National Car Rental as part of an expansion of holdings and growth outside the insurance business. Both Braniff and National were chosen after Greatamerica CFO C. Edward Acker identified them as under utilized and managed companies. As part of the acquisition, Acker became Executive Vice President and CFO of Braniff. Harding L. Lawrence Becomes President. In 1965, Troy Post hired Harding Lawrence, then the Executive Vice President of Continental Airlines, as the new president of Braniff International. In a 1964 study by financier C. Edward Acker, Braniff was found to be to conservatively managed which was hampering growth that would be required in the new jet age. Braniff was also paying for large jet aircraft out of company generated funds rather than financing the aircraft. This caused working capital to be diverted away from growth initiatives. Harding Lawrence was determined to give Braniff a glossy, modern and attention-getting image. Over the next 15 years Lawrence's aggressive expansion into new markets - combined with ideas unorthodox for the airline industry - led Braniff to record industry financial and operating performance, expanding its earnings tenfold despite typical passenger load factors around 50 percent. The End of the Plain Plane. To overhaul the Braniff image Lawrence hired Jack Tinker and Partners, who assigned advertising executive Mary Wells — later known as Mary Wells Lawrence after her 1967 marriage to Harding Lawrence in Paris — as account leader. First on the agenda was to overhaul Braniff's public image — including the red, white, and blue livery which the public perceived as ""staid"". New Mexico architect Alexander Girard, Italian fashion designer Emilio Pucci, and shoe designer Beth Levine were hired, and with this new creative talent, Braniff began the revolutionary ""End of the Plain Plane"" campaign.  At Girard's recommendation the old livery was dropped in favor of planes painted in a single color, selected from a wide palette of bright hues. Girard wanted the planes painted from tail to nose in colors like ""Chocolate Brown"" and ""Metallic Purple."" He also favored a small ""BI"" distinctive logo and small titles. Braniff engineering and Braniff's advertising department modified Girard's colors, enlarged the ""BI"" logo, and added white wings and tails. This, ironically, was based on the 1930s Braniff ""Vega"" Schemes, which also carried colorful aircraft paint with white wings and tails. The new ""jelly bean"" fleet consisted of such bold colors as beige, ochre, orange, turquoise, baby blue, medium blue, lemon yellow, and lavender (lavender was dropped after one month, as lavender and black were considered bad luck in Mexico because of the Black (and lavender) WItch Moth or Ascalapha odorata). Girard also outfitted the interiors with 57 different variations of Herman Miller fabrics. Fifteen colors were used by Braniff for plane exteriors during the 1960s (Harper & George modified Girard's original seven colors in 1968). Girard also designed an extensive line of furniture for Braniff's ticket offices and customer lounges. This furniture was also available to the public by Herman Miller in 1967 and was available for one year only. Many of the color schemes were applied to aircraft interiors, gate lounges, ticket offices, and even the corporate headquarters. Art to complement the color schemes was flown in from Mexico, Latin America, and South America.  Pucci used a series of nautical themes in overhauling the crew's uniforms. For the hostesses, Pucci used ""space age"" themes, including plastic Space Helmets and Bola's as dubbed by Pucci and called Rain Domes by Braniff (resembling Captain Video helmets), which the hostesses could wear between the terminal and the plane to prevent hairstyles from being disturbed by outside elements. However, the ""space bubble"" was dropped after about a month because the helmets cracked easily, there was no place to store them on the aircraft, and jetways at many airports made them unnecessary. For the footwear, Beth Levine created plastic boots and designed two-tone calfskin boots and shoes. Stewardesses were called ""hostesses"" at Braniff and were attired with uniforms and accessories composed of interchangeable parts which could be removed and added as needed. In 1969, Pucci designed ""Pucci IV"", for the intro of ""747 Braniff Place"" (1971). The collection was debuted at the Dallas Hilton by Pucci himself, in 1970. Today, all of the vintage Pucci attire designed for Braniff are valuable.  When You Got It Flaunt It Campaign. In 1968, under the leadership of George Lois and his advertising firm, Braniff expanded the advertising campaign that showed the likenesses of Andy Warhol, Sonny Liston, Salvador Dalí, Whitey Ford, the Playboy Bunny, and other celebrities of the time, all flying Braniff. After the Plain Plane Campaign it became one of the most celebrated marketing efforts Madison Avenue had ever produced, blending style and arrogance. One advertising slogan was ""When you got it — flaunt it!"" Although management considered the campaign a success, some of Braniff's customers thought the campaign exhibited grandiose behavior and bragging when service levels were at times not where they should have been. However, Braniff exhibited an 80 percent increase in business during the time the campaign was in use.  Building The Braniff Jet Fleet. Braniff entered the jet-age in 1959 with the Boeing 707-227. Braniff took delivery of four 707s; one crashed while on the delivery test flight and was still owned by Boeing. Braniff was the only airline to order the B707-227; in 1971 it sold them to BWIA. Boeing 720s were added in the early 1960s. In 1964 Braniff became the launch U.S. customer for the British-built BAC One-Eleven. By 1965 Braniff's fleet was 95 percent jets.  During his first month Braniff Lawrence executed an order for 12 new Boeing 727 aircraft. Lawrence then cancelled most of the remaining British Aircraft Corp. BAC-One11 orders in favor of the larger Boeing 727. The 727s had already been selected before Lawrence's arrival but had not been acted upon. These planes were the C model which came with a large freight loading door at the front of the aircraft. This allowed Braniff to begin late night cargo service while during the day regular passenger service was operated with the aircraft. This new service doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to literally open a new cargo business that was called AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a unique cargo/passenger configuration, if needed. The 727 would become the backbone of the Braniff Fleet and the key aircraft in the 1971 Fleet Standardization Plan that called for only three aircraft types: Boeing 727 on domestic service, 747 for Hawaii, and DC-8 for South America. This Lawrence plan allowed for reduction in costs associated with operating multiple types of aircraft. When Lawrence took office in May, 1965, Braniff operated thirteen different aircraft types. Lawrence also increased daily utilization of its aircraft that allowed Braniff to fly as though it had added aircraft to the fleet.  The Boeing 747 that flew between Dallas and Honolulu starting in 1971 flew an unprecedented 15 hours per day with a 99 percent dispatch reliability rate. Braniff eventually ordered several variants of the 727 including the ""quick change"" cargo/passenger variant, the stretched B727-200, and later the 727-200 Advanced. By 1969 the Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops had all been retired, making Braniff ""all jet"". By the mid-1970s Braniff's fleet of Boeing 727s showed the efficiencies that a single type of aircraft could produce; in 1975 Braniff had one (1) B747, eleven (11) DC-8s, and seventy (70) B727s. PANAGRA Merger and MAC Charters. In 1967 Braniff purchased Pan American-Grace Airways (PANAGRA), buying it from shareholders of Pan American World Airways and W.R. Grace. The purchase increased Braniff's presence in South America. In 1966, Braniff investor Troy V. Post, by now a regular at the Johnson White House, obtained a government contract to transport military personnel from Vietnam to Hawaii for their R&R furloughs during the Vietnam War. The Military Air Command routes were expanded in the Pacific and added to the Atlantic side in 1966.  New Facilities. Braniff opened the ""Terminal of the Future"" at its home base at Dallas Love Field in late 1968. The airline also operated Jetrail from 1970 to 1974, the world's first fully automated monorail system that took passengers from remote parking at Dallas Love Field to the Braniff Terminal. Braniff was a key partner in the planning of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and contributed many innovations to the airline industry during this time. Airline Look Of The 70s. section history in process 1970s redesigns, and the 747 comes to Braniff. In 1970 Braniff accepted delivery of the 100th Boeing 747 built—a 747-127, N601BN—and began ""jumbo jet"" flights from Dallas to Hawaii on January 15, 1971. This plane, dubbed ""747 Braniff Place"" and ""The Most Exclusive Address In The Sky"", was Braniff's flagship. In 1978 N601BN flew the first flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to London. More 747s and 747SPs were acquired for flights to Asia and Europe. The Douglas DC-8s were aging, and there was speculation whether new McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, Boeing 757s, or Boeing 767s would replace the DC-8-62s (which flew South American routes).  Alexander Calder's Flying Artworks. In 1973 Alexander Calder was commissioned by Braniff to paint an aircraft. Calder was introduced to Harding Lawrence by veteran advertising executive George Gordon who would eventually take over the Braniff advertising account. Calder's contribution was a Douglas DC-8 known simply as ""Flying Colors of South America."" In 1975 it was showcased at the Paris Air Show in Paris, France. Its designs reflected the bright colors and simple designs of South America and Latin America, and was used mainly on South American flights. Later in 1975 he debuted ""Flying Colors of the United States"" to commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States. This time, the aircraft was a Boeing 727-200. First Lady Betty Ford dedicated ""Flying Colors of the United States"" in Washington, D.C. on November 17, 1975. Calder died in November, 1976 as he was finalizing a third livery, termed ""Flying Colors of Mexico"" or ""Salute To Mexico"", therefore this livery was not used on any Braniff aircraft. Halston and the Elegance Campaign. In 1977 Braniff dropped Pucci as its designer of uniforms. American Couturier Halston was then commissioned to bring an elegant and refined feel to Braniff. His Ultra Suede uniforms and leather aircraft interiors were part of Braniff's new image, dubbed Ultra Look by Halston who had used the term to describe his elegant fashions. The Ultra Look was applied to all uniforms and the Braniff fleet, including Boeing 727, 747 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft (the Calder aircraft were eventually all painted in the new Ultra Scheme) and were an integral part of Braniff's new Elegance Campaign. The Elegance Campaign was embraced to show the maturing of Braniff and the look and feel of opulence throughout the airline's operation. Halston's uniforms and simplistic designs were praised by critics and passengers.  Deregulation and Global Expansion. Up to 1980 Braniff was one of the fastest-growing and most-profitable airlines in the United States. But deregulation of the airline industry was introduced in December, 1978, and Braniff as well as many of the nation's major air carrier's misjudged this uncharted change in conducting airline business.  Lawrence believed that the answer to deregulation was to expand Braniff's route system dramatically; the domestic system became 50% larger, as an example. On December 15, 1978, Braniff added 16 new cities and 32 new routes, which it said was the ""largest single-day increase by any airline in history"" This historical expansion was successful both operationally and financially. Fuel costs became the main damaging component to Braniff's post-deregulation expansion. These costs increased an unprecedented 94 percent in 1979 alone.  Some of the expected new business never materialized; 747 service from the new Boston hub did poorly, the huge planes flying nearly empty. The expense of the new equipment and the new hubs increased Braniff's debt tremendously. More debt was incurred in shifting Braniff's main base of flight operations from Love Field in Dallas to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. However, this was required by a 1968 agreement signed by Braniff and other airlines then operating at Dallas Love Field. Simultaneous with the move to a new airport, Braniff moved to a sprawling new world headquarters, Braniff Place, just inside the western grounds of the airport. Braniff's sub-par load factors, which were especially intolerable on the expensive-to-run 747s, record breaking fuel cost escalations and the large debts combined to produce massive financial shortfalls. The rising debts caused by fuel costs, debt service, and a nationwide recession led to creditors requesting the retirement of Harding Lawrence in December 1980. Concorde. The airline started service with Concorde in 1979 between Dallas/Fort Worth and Washington, D.C., to Paris and London on interchange flights with Air France and British Airways. Flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Washington Dulles airports were commanded by Braniff cockpit and cabin crews while British or French crews would take over for the remaining segment to Europe. Over U.S. soil Concorde was limited to Mach 0.95, though crews often flew just above Mach 1; the planes flew at Mach 2 over open water. Transfer of ownership took place in Washington each time Concorde flew in the U.S. Braniff actually owned the planes while on U.S. domestic service, and the planes were re-registered with temporary tape. Ownership was then re-transferred to Air France or British Airways on the Trans-Atlantic leg.  Concorde service proved a financial loss for Braniff but an advertising and marketing coup. Though Braniff charged only a 10% premium over standard first-class fare to fly Concorde - and later removed the surcharge altogether - the 100-seat plane often flew with no more than 15 passengers. Meanwhile, Boeing 727s flying the same route were filled routinely. Concorde service ended after little more than a year. However, the notoriety that Braniff received from operating Concorde was advertising that could not be readily bought and further enforced the carrier's cutting edge reputation.  Although many postcards show a Braniff Concorde, the Braniff livery was never applied to the left side of any Concorde, and the aircraft remained in the colors of British Airways and Air France throughout the operation. Braniff ceased Concorde operations at the end of May, 1980. John J. Casey Becomes President. On January 7, 1981, the Braniff Board of Directors elected John J. Casey as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Braniff Airways, Inc and Braniff International Corporation as a replacement to the outgoing and retiring Harding Lawrence. Former Braniff President Russ Thayer was elected as Vice Chairman of the Board, William Huskins as Executive Vice President, Neal J. Robinson as Executive Vice President of Marketing, and Edson ""Ted"" Beckwith as Executive Vice President of Finance.  John Casey expanded Braniff traffic during the Summer of 1980 in an effort to take advantage of the traditional Summer increase in traffic. However, an unforeseen stike by the Professional Air Traffic Controller's (PATCO) union caused airline delays and a decrease in traffic that harmed Braniff creating large losses. Casey implemented the Braniff Strikes Back Campaign in the Fall of 1981, that included streamlining of the carrier's air fare structure into a more simplified two tier fare system. As part of this Campaign Boeing 727 fleet was divided into Braniff Premier Service which featured traditional First Class service on select routings. The remainder of the 727 system featured an all Coach Class configuration with highly reduced fares. The Campaign was not successful and created the unintended effect of pushing Braniff's bread and butter business travelers over to traditional airlines with First Class seating on all flights. Howard Putnam Becomes Final Braniff President. In the Fall of 1981, Braniff Chairman John Casey was told by the Braniff Board that a new President for Braniff must be found to try and curb the losses that the airline had suffered since 1979 but had increased dramatically in 1981. Casey met with Southwest Airlines President Howard A. Putnam and offered him the Braniff executive position. Putnam accepted the offer but required that his own finance person, Phillip Guthrie, from Southwest Airlines be allowed to follow him to Braniff.  Howard Putnam implemented a one fare structure plan called Texas Class Campaign. Texas Class created a one fare one service airline domestically and removed First Class from all Braniff aircraft. Only the international services to South America, London and domestically to Hawaii would retain full First Class services. In the program's first month in operation, December, 1981, Braniff's revenues immediately dropped from slightly over 100 million USD per month to 80 million USD. Braniff no longer had the revenue structure to maintain its cash requirements. Competition throughout the Braniff system coupled with the onslaught of increased services at Braniff's main hub, Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport, by American and Delta Airlines caused a further erosion in the airline's revenue production. Cessation of Operations. On May 11, 1982 the Braniff's final CEO, Howard Putnam, who was President of Southwest Airlines from 1978 to 1981, left a courtroom at the Federal Courthouse in Brooklyn, New York City, after he failed to gain a court injunction to stop a threatened pilot strike. However, Putnam was successful in getting an extension of time from Braniff's principal creditor's until October, 1982. The next day, on May 12, 1982, Braniff Airways ceased all operations, thus ending 54 years of service in the American airline industry. Braniff flights at DFW that morning were suddenly grounded, and passengers on the jets were forced to disembark, being told that Braniff now ceased to exist. According to the book ""Splash Of Colors"", an afternoon thunderstorm provided the perfect cover to cancel many afternoon flights that day, although Braniff flight 501 to Honolulu departed DFW with the crew subsequently refusing to divert the flight to Los Angeles International Airport. In the days that followed, all the Braniff jets based at Dallas/Fort Worth sat idle on the apron by Terminal 2W. With the demise of Braniff, Braniff Place World Headquarters on the West side of DFW Airport eventually became GTE Place, and then Verizon Place. Successor organizations. Three airlines were formed following the shutdown of Braniff. Former Braniff employees founded Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines in 1983. It flew a fleet of Boeing 727-200s and DC-10s until 2001. It reorganized and currently flies a modern fleet of Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. Two other airlines were formed from the assets of Braniff: The book ""Deregulation Knockouts, Round 2"" documents at least two attempts to use the Braniff name in operations subsequent to the above attempts: one would have based the company again at Dallas-Ft.Worth Airport utilizing Boeing 757 aircraft. Another operation would have been based at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport and would have offered discounted fares to members of a ""Braniff Club"". The remains of the original Braniff—including Braniff Airways original Tax ID number (FEIN)—are retained by a company named ""Asworth"" in Dallas. Asworth was formed out of the old ""Dalfort"" corporation and is responsible for paying pilot pensions according to the Braniff Retired Pilots Group, B.I.S.E. "

wikipedia-383851," Joey Santiago  Joseph Alberto ""Joey"" Santiago (born June 10, 1965) is a Filipino-American guitarist and composer. Active since 1986, Santiago is best known as the lead guitarist for the American alternative rock band the Pixies. After the band's breakup in 1993, Santiago produced musical scores for film and television documentaries, and he formed The Martinis with his wife, Linda Mallari. He also contributed to albums by Charles Douglas and former Pixies band-mate Frank Black. Santiago resumed his role as the Pixies' lead guitarist when they reunited in 2004. Santiago has described his guitar technique as ""angular and bent"", and he cites Les Paul, George Harrison, Chet Atkins, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass and Jimi Hendrix as major influences on his style. His guitar playing, as part of the Pixies' sound, was held in high regard by critics: MTV's Laurel Bowman commented that Santiago's ""sonic plow was the key element in the Pixies' monstrous presence"". Early life and education. Santiago was born in Manila, Philippines, on June 10, 1965, the third of six sons of an anesthesiologist. In 1972, when President Marcos declared martial law, the family emigrated to the United States. After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground's ""Rock and Roll"". As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program ""Iggy"" and his second ""Pop"" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money. After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics. He met Charles Thompson, an anthropology student and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars. Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing ""non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock"" with Thompson. Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: ""Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music ... He'd write 'em songs, and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar."" In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a ""weird, psycho roommate,"" Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words ""We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams""; Santiago replied, saying ""Yes, now's the time."" Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago. Pixies. Upon Thompson's return to Massachusetts, the pair dropped out of college and moved to Boston. They both took temporary jobs in warehouses, with Santiago working for a butcher block company. In January 1986, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago. Thompson gave Santiago the choice of bass or lead guitar; Santiago chose to play lead. The pair arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word randomly from a dictionary and liked the definition, ""mischievous little elves."" They recruited Kim Deal a week later after placing a classified ad in a Boston paper for a bassist ""into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary."" Drummer David Lovering was later hired on recommendation from Deal's husband. The Pixies rehearsed throughout 1986, and began performing around Boston in late 1986 and during 1987. Santiago met his future wife, Linda Mallari, when he sat beside her after a 1987 Pixies show at The Rat. Mallari noted their shared Filipino ancestry and suggested they write music together. She then offered to join the Pixies, but Santiago replied, ""We already have a chick in the band."" Throughout Santiago's time with the Pixies, the two often met up to write songs and drink martinis, but they did not release any material. According to Santiago, they ""broke up a couple of times"" early in their relationship. The Pixies signed to the English independent record label 4AD in 1987. On meeting the head of the label, Ivo Watts-Russell, Santiago remarked: ""All I care about is that you make me famous in the Philippines because all the chicks are really pretty"". Watts-Russell later said ""that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say,"" and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, ""Come On Pilgrim"", featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as ""The Holiday Song"" and ""Vamos"". For the release of the album, Thompson adopted the alias ""Black Francis"". After the band's next two albums, 1988's ""Surfer Rosa"" and 1989's ""Doolittle"", the relationship between the band members became strained; the Pixies were constantly touring and had released three albums in two years. During their homecoming Boston concert, on the post-""Doolittle"" ""Fuck or Fight"" tour, Santiago smashed up his instrument and stormed offstage. The band announced a break soon afterwards. During this time, Santiago visited the Grand Canyon to ""find himself."" After the band reconvened in 1990, Santiago contributed to the band's later releases, 1990's ""Bossanova"" and 1991's ""Trompe le Monde"", adopting a surf guitar style in the former. The Pixies eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Francis and Deal, although the breakup was not publicly announced until 1993. The Martinis and composing. After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, ""Frank Black"", contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including 1994's ""Teenager of the Year"", and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album ""Mangled"". He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded ""Free"" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of ""Empire Records"". The band played live only occasionally until 2001. In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including ""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia"" in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series ""Undeclared"" with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album ""Statecraft"". He scored the 2003 film ""The Low Budget Time Machine"" and wrote two songs, ""Birthday Video"" and ""Fake Purse,"" for the Showtime television series ""Weeds"" in 2005. Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, ""Smitten"", took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, during the recording. Santiago described the album as ""a lot poppier and quirkier"" than the band's previous material. The band simultaneously released ""The Smitten Sessions"", a limited edition EP. Pixies reunion and future projects. After the Pixies broke up in 1993, Santiago had stayed in touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: ""He called me on my cellphone and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'"" Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and by the summer of 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the ""Shrek 2"" soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, ""worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing"", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, ""Bam Thwok"". Aside from the Pixies and The Martinis, Santiago scored the soundtrack of the documentary ""Radiant City"" in 2006. He signed with the commercial sound agency Elias Arts in the same year, and focused on composing music for television commercials. In a March 2006 Billboard.com interview, he dismissed the possibility of a new Pixies album for the time being: ""I'd only be interested if it happens in an organic manner; if all our schedules are aligned and we're all feeling it. That's the only reason to do it."" Santiago also played a benefit concert for drummer Wally Ingram in February 2007 as part of The Martinis; the band's first gig for six years. Musical style. Santiago describes his guitar playing as ""angular and bent,"" ""all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up"". Notable in his style is how he uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' ""Savoy Truffle"", where ""George Harrison played that bent note that I fell in love with and later milked it for all it was worth."" He used such techniques with the Pixies: ""Doolittle's"" ""Dead"" begins with Santiago's guitar ""squawking"" on an E-flat like ""a wounded animal"". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing. Santiago, rather than listening to popular radio, borrowed rock and roll records from the public library as he was growing up; he first discovered Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix, who led to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Santiago later commented on Montgomery's influence: ""And that's when I said, 'Ah, that's a hook. That's some hooky stuff in the jazz world'"". He discovered jazz and country artists such as Joe Pass and Chet Atkins after studying the liner notes of albums. Santiago was directly influenced by the ""Hendrix chord"", the sharp 9th dominant chord which, in the words of author Ben Sisario, ""tapped a hidden rage that matched the horror of Thompson's scream"". As a teenager, Santiago also listened to classic rock and protopunk artists such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop. The stage antics of Santiago often contrasted with his generally quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal's husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of ""Vamos"", which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to ""whack the crap out of his amp"", often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up to his mouth and break guitar strings with his teeth. Discography. Santiago is credited as guitar unless otherwise specified: "

Before 1997 he had also served as the director of Canadians Against Forced Unionism, an organization related to the National Citizens Coalition. Parliamentarian. Anders was first elected as the Reform Party MP for Calgary West in 1997, at age 25. The seat had been vacated when the former MP for the riding, Stephen Harper, resigned unexpectedly in 1996. Despite his relative youthfulness, Anders was already a veteran political organizer, and was able to win a hotly contested nomination in one of the safest Reform ridings in Canada. Along with fellow newly elected MPs Jason Kenney and Rahim Jaffer and advisor Ezra Levant, Anders was part of an up-and-coming group of young Reformers which pundits dubbed the ""Snack Pack"" due to their relative youth and girth. Anders was a supporter of Stephen Harper's successful 2002 bid for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance, providing significant assistance with the campaign's phone-banking. In 2003, Anders voted for a Bloc Québécois proposition which stated that the Québécois form a nation and could withdraw from any federal initiative. He was the only non-Québécois to vote for this proposition. Anders was formerly a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. He was removed from that position, partly based on his tendency to fall asleep during meetings. He has been reassigned to the House-Senate Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. He is also a former member of the Reform Party (1997–2000) and the Canadian Alliance (2000–2003). He is a former Official Opposition Critic for National Defense and former Co-Chair of the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper has indicated his support of Anders, stating that ""Rob is a true reformer and a true conservative. He has been a faithful supporter of mine and I am grateful for his work."" In 2011 Rob Anders began to lobby for the government to stop funding the CBC. Controversies. Anders was the sole parliamentarian to vote against making Nelson Mandela an honorary citizen of Canada in 2001, which prevented the act from passing unanimously. He defended his actions by stating that Mandela was a communist and a terrorist, causing widespread criticism. As a result, during the past two federal elections, Anders has been the target of a mostly unsuccessful non-partisan ""Vote Out Rob Anders"" campaign in his riding, but his popular vote percentage has increased every federal election since he was first elected in the 1997 Canadian federal election. Until 2006, his percentage of popular vote progressively increased from 51.79% in 1997 to 58.7% in 2006. His raw numbers in the popular vote dropped in 2004 by less than 2000 votes over his 2000 election but rebounded in 2006 to his highest vote total to date. Voter turnout in his riding for the 2006 election was the highest in Alberta [http://www.elections.ca/scripts/OVR2006/25/table12.html] at 69.9%. In 2008, Anders' share of the popular vote declined slightly to 57.4%.  In December 2005, Anders used public funds to send pamphlets to residents in Richmond, B.C., a constituency far removed from his own. The leaflets caused bewilderment for including a survey question about ""homosexual sex marriage"" in a flyer otherwise addressing crime and crystal meth abuse. Anders has been a consistent critic of the human rights record of the People's Republic of China. He has described the PRC as ""the worst human-rights abuser in the world,"" and compared the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He argued that ""China is the wrong choice to host the Games... I absolutely 100% think it compares to the Berlin Olympics in 1936."" Anders highlights that the fact that Falun Gong practitioners are not allowed to participate in the Olympics is comparable with Adolf Hitler's issue with Jewish participation in the 1936 Berlin Olympics."" Anders has also said that no Canadian politician should attend the games, nor should any Canadian athletes be used as ""propaganda tools."" His comments were criticized by local Chinese trade association as well as fellow Calgary Tory MP Deepak Obhrai who disclaimed Anders ""was speaking as an individual and his comments are not reflective of government policy."" In 2010, in a card supporting Canadian troops, Anders wrote: ""When in doubt, pull the trigger"". Anders' decision to become involved in the newly formed Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta has generated controversy, as the Wildrose Alliance Party had hoped to defeat the ruling Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta in the province's 2012 election. Ron Liepert, Alberta's Minister of Energy, accused Anders of campaigning against him. In February 2010, nineteen members of Anders' Calgary West riding association resigned ""en masse"", citing interference from the Conservative Party. The 32 member board had been planning to ask Conservative Party members at the riding's upcoming annual general meeting whether they wanted to hold a nomination contest. The party's national council intervened, saying it had already declared Anders as the candidate for the next federal election, and threatened to take control of the annual general meeting of the constituency association. The resignations brought the total number of board members who had resigned over the course of one year to twenty-four. In March 2012, Anders was removed from the Veterans Affairs Committee following controversial comments in response to arriving late, texting, and falling asleep at a committee meeting (including calling his accusers NDP hacks who praise Vladimir Putin). In July 2012, Anders opposed his own party and criticized Treasury Board President Tony Clement for funding a visitors' centre honouring to Norman Bethune, a Canadian physician who died while performing emergency medicine for the Chinese resistance against the Japanese occupation of China. According to Anders, ""You don't need taxpayer money to go ahead and memorialize somebody who was a fan of the biggest killer in human history Zedong"", referring to Bethune's communist ideals although Bethune had died ten years before Mao took power. In September and October 2012, fellow Conservative Party members disassociated themselves from Anders' belief that New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair ""Hastened the death"" of former NDP leader Jack Layton by encouraging an election while being in questionable health. In October 2012, Anders attracted some controversy by calling Bill C279, a private member's bill that would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and hate crime section of the Criminal Code to include ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"" as grounds for discrimination, a ""bathroom bill"". Community involvement. Anders has devoted his time to a variety of right-wing organizations. Some of these include lobby groups and think tanks such as Focus on the Family, the Canada Family Action Coalition, and to several causes opposing the Government of China's policies regarding Tibet and Falun Gong.

wikipedia-383854," Parasitology  Parasitology is the study of parasites, their hosts, and the relationship between them. As a biological discipline, the scope of parasitology is not determined by the organism or environment in question, but by their way of life. This means it forms a synthesis of other disciplines, and draws on techniques from fields such as cell biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, genetics, evolution and ecology. Fields. The study of these diverse organisms means that the subject is often broken up into simpler, more focused units, which use common techniques, even if they are not studying the same organisms or diseases. Much research in parasitology falls somewhere between two or more of these definitions. In general, the study of prokaryotes falls under the field of bacteriology rather than parasitology. Medical parasitology. ""Humans are hosts to nearly 300 species of parasitic worms and over 70 species of protozoa, some derived from our primate ancestors and some acquired from the animals we have domesticated or come in contact with during our relatively short history on Earth"".  One of the largest fields in parasitology, medical parasitology is the subject which deals with the parasites that infect humans, the diseases caused by them, clinical picture and the response generated by humans against them. It is also concerned with the various methods of their diagnosis, treatment and finally their prevention & control. A parasite is an organism that live on or within another organism called the host . These include organisms such as: Medical parasitology can involve drug development, epidemiological studies and study of zoonoses. Veterinary parasitology. The study of parasites that cause economic losses in agriculture or aquaculture operations, or which infect companion animals. Examples of species studied are: Structural parasitology. This is the study of structures of proteins from parasites. Determination of parasitic protein structures may help to better understand how these proteins function differently from homologous proteins in humans. In addition, protein structures may inform the process of drug discovery. Quantitative parasitology. Parasites exhibit an aggregated distribution among host individuals, thus the majority of parasites live in the minority of hosts. This feature forces parasitologists to use advanced biostatistical methodologies. Parasite ecology. Parasites can provide information about host population ecology. In fisheries biology, for example, parasite communities can be used to distinguish distinct populations of the same fish species co-inhabiting a region. Additionally, parasites possess a variety of specialized traits and life-history strategies that enable them to colonize hosts. Understanding these aspects of parasite ecology, of interest in their own right, can illuminate parasite-avoidance strategies employed by hosts Conservation biology of parasites. Conservation biology is concerned with the protection and preservation of vulnerable species, including parasites. A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction, partly due to efforts to eradicate parasites which infect humans or domestic animals, or damage human economy, but also caused by the decline or fragmentation of host populations and the extinction of host species. Taxonomy and phylogenetics. The huge diversity between parasitic organisms creates a challenge for biologists who wish to describe and catalogue them. Recent developments in using DNA to identify separate species and to investigate the relationship between groups at various taxonomic scales has been enormously useful to parasitologists, as many parasites are highly degenerate, disguising relationships between species. History of parasitology. ""Our knowledge of parasitic infections extends into antiquity, and descriptions of parasites and parasitic infections are found in the earliest writings and have been confirmed by the finding of parasites in archaeological material"".

wikipedia-383864," Joe Piscopo  Joseph Charles John ""Joe"" Piscopo (pronounced PIS-ka-po) (born June 17, 1951) is an American comedian and actor best known for his work on ""Saturday Night Live"" where he played a variety of recurring characters. Early life. Born in Passaic, New Jersey, Piscopo attended West Essex High School and was a member of the drama club ""the Masquers"". He developed a reputation for never playing a part the way it was written. When he was not clowning around he could usually be found lifting weights with his cousins Paul LaMagna and Bill Dolphin (Scarecrow). Graduating high school in 1969, Joe went on to attend Jones College in Jacksonville, Florida. There he received his degree in broadcast management. Although his mother wanted him to follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer, Joe ultimately went into stand-up comedy in the late 1970s, becoming a cast member of the short-lived sketch-comedy series ""Madhouse Brigade"" in 1978. ""Saturday Night Live"". In the summer of 1980, he was hired as a contract player for ""Saturday Night Live"". The show had gone through major upheaval when all the writers, major producers, and cast members had left that spring. The all-new cast bombed with critics and fans with the exception of Piscopo and Eddie Murphy; thus they were the only two cast members to be kept when Dick Ebersol took over the show the following spring. With the success of SNL, both Murphy and Piscopo moved to Alpine, New Jersey. Piscopo was best known for his impressions of such celebrities as Frank Sinatra, although he feared for his life due to Sinatra's alleged Mafia ties. Piscopo thus rewrote the lyrics for a Sinatra sketch with the help of Sinatra lyricist Sammy Cahn, and recalled that ""by the grace of God, the old man loved it."" Piscopo left ""SNL"" in 1984, but unlike Eddie Murphy he did not find major success. He appeared in a few successful films such as ""Johnny Dangerously"" and ""Wise Guys"", and also had his own HBO comedy special. One of Piscopo's more successful bits on ""SNL"" included his sports commentary on the Weekend Update portion of the show (called ""SNL Newsbreak"" at that time), led by a series of rhyming or otherwise associated words, rather than a sentence, leading up to his first story. One example surrounded one of Muhammad Ali's last bouts during the 1980s, with Eddie Murphy in Rick Baker makeup as Ali. ""The big story, Muhammad Ali! Last night... fight... drama... Bahama... LOST!"" and... ""The big story! Baseball! Yankees! Billy Martin hired! The big question: When will he be fired?"" Piscopo's sports reports provided NBC network officials enough confidence to allow him to continue this persona on NBC's Sportsworld program in the early 1980s. During his time on SNL, Piscopo recorded two singles. The first, ""I Love Rock 'n Roll (Medley)"" was released in 1982 using his impression of Frank Sinatra, and included big-band arrangements of the title song by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, ""Cold as Ice"" by Foreigner, ""Under My Thumb"" by The Rolling Stones, ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot"" by Pat Benatar, ""Born to Run"" by Bruce Springsteen, ""I Know What Boys Like"" by The Waitresses, ""Smoke on the Water"" by Deep Purple, and ""Life During Wartime"" by The Talking Heads. The second single was ""The Honeymooners Rap,"" in which he performed as Jackie Gleason's character Ralph Kramden of ""The Honeymooners"". Also appearing on the single was Eddie Murphy as Art Carney's character Ed Norton. ""The Honeymooners Rap"" also appeared on Piscopo's 1985 comedy album ""New Jersey"". In the character of Paulie Herman, Piscopo lampooned Piscataway Township, New Jersey, triggering an immediate outcry from officials of that Township, and the character was dropped. Part of the reparteé of the Paulie Herman character was a Piscopo catchphrase in response to other characters mentioning New Jersey: ""You from Jersey? What Exit?!"" In the 1980s, Piscopo starred in a series of Miller Beer commercials. In 1984, Piscopo made a cameo appearance at the end of the Billy Joel music video ""Keeping the Faith"". (He gives a shoe-shine boy $100 and says ""Keep the faith kid."") In 1986 Piscopo appeared in the ""Lets Go Mets"" music video. He also co-starred with Treat Williams in the 1988 film ""Dead Heat"". In 1988 he appeared in the """" episode ""The Outrageous Okona"" as a holographic comedian, for which he provided all of his own jokes and dialogue. In 1992 he provided the voice for Sheriff Terrorbull in the Saturday-morning animated series ""Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa"". He also supplied the voice of a manager in an episode of """" and The Dogfather in the revived ""Pink Panther"" series in 1993. He also lent his voice to the Canadian animated special ""The Real Story of Rain, Rain Go Away"". In the early 1990s, Piscopo became a subject of controversy after appearances of his newly buff physique on the covers of fitness magazines led many to speculate he was using steroids. Piscopo has repeatedly denied the allegations and says he began a campaign to improve himself after battling thyroid cancer from 1981 to 1982. He has also appeared in anti-steroid public service announcements. Piscopo lampooned the controversy in his HBO special, wherein he appeared to undergo a drug test during the show. Personal information. In 1973, Piscopo married television producer Nancy Jones (""Wheel of Fortune""). The couple divorced in 1988. Piscopo's second wife, Kimberly Driscoll, filed for divorce on July 10, 2006. Piscopo is a resident of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, and is an avid New Jersey Devils fan. Piscopo starred in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" at the Gateway Playhouse in August 2009, playing 8 performance per week for a three week run. He has also been a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey. "
wikipedia-383876," Crenarchaeota  The Crenarchaeota (Greek for ""spring old quality"") (also known as Crenarchaea or eocytes) are Archaea that have been classified as a phylum of the Archaea kingdom. Initially, the Crenarchaeota were thought to be sulfur-dependent extremophiles but recent studies have identified characteristic Crenarchaeota environmental rRNA indicating the organism may be the most abundant archaea in the marine environment. Originally, they were separated from the other archaea based on rRNA sequences; however, other physiological features, such as lack of histones have supported this division, although some crenarchaea were found to have histones. Until recently all cultured Crenarchaea had been thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms, some of which have the ability to grow at up to 113 °C. These organisms stain Gram negative and are morphologically diverse having rod, cocci, filamentous and oddly shaped cells. ""Sulfolobus"". One of the best characterized members of the Crenarcheota is ""Sulfolobus solfataricus"". This organism was originally isolated from geothermally heated sulfuric springs in Italy, and grows at 80 °C and pH of 2–4. Since its initial characterization by Wolfram Zillig, a pioneer in thermophile and archaean research, similar species in the same genus have been found around the world. Unlike the vast majority of cultured thermophiles, ""Sulfolobus"" grows aerobically and chemoorganotrophically (gaining its energy from organic sources such as sugars). These factors allow a much easier growth under laboratory conditions than anaerobic organisms and have led to ""Sulfolobus"" becoming a model organism for the study of hyperthermophiles and a large group of diverse viruses that replicate within them. Marine species. Beginning in 1992, data were published that reported sequences of genes belonging to the Crenarchaea in marine environments., Since then, analysis of the abundant lipids from the membranes of Crenarchaea taken from the open ocean have been used to determine the concentration of these “low temperature Crenarchaea” (See TEX-86). Based on these measurements of their signature lipids, Crenarchaea are thought to be very abundant and one of the main contributors to the fixation of carbon . DNA sequences from Crenarchaea have also been found in soil and freshwater environments, suggesting that this phylum is ubiquitous to most environments. In 2005, evidence of the first cultured “low temperature Crenarchaea” was published. Named ""Nitrosopumilus maritimus"", it is an ammonia-oxidizing organism isolated from a marine aquarium tank and grown at 28 °C. Eocyte hypothesis. The eocyte hypothesis proposed in the 1980s by James Lake suggests that eukaryotes evolved from the prokaryotic eocyte. One possible piece of evidence supporting a close relationship between Crenarchaea and eukaryotes is the presence of a homolog of the RNA polymerase subunit Rbp-8 in Crenarchea but not Euryarchaea  "
wikipedia-383884," John D. MacDonald  John Dann MacDonald (July 24, 1916 – December 28, 1986) was an American writer of novels and short stories, known for his thrillers. MacDonald was a prolific author of crime and suspense novels, many of them set in his adopted home of Florida. His best-known works include the popular and critically acclaimed Travis McGee series, and his novel ""The Executioners"", which was adapted into the film ""Cape Fear"". In 1972, MacDonald was named a grandmaster of the Mystery Writers of America, and he won a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Mystery.  Stephen King praised MacDonald as ""the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller."" Kingsley Amis said, MacDonald ""is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow, only MacDonald writes thrillers and Bellow is a human-heart chap, so guess who wears the top-grade laurels?"" Early life. MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, where his father worked for Savage Arms. The family moved to Utica, N.Y. in 1926, where his father was now Treasurer of the Utica branch of the Savage Arms Corporation. In 1934, Young John was sent to Europe for several weeks, and this whetted his appetite for travel and for photography. MacDonald enrolled at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, but was not doing well and dropped out during his sophomore year. He worked menial jobs in New York City for a short time and then was accepted at Syracuse University. While there, he met Dorothy Prentiss and they married in 1937.  McDonald graduated from Syracuse the following year. In 1939, he received an MBA from Harvard University. MacDonald was later able to make good use of his education in business and economics by incorporating elaborate business swindles into the plots of a number of his novels. In 1940, MacDonald accepted a direct commission as a First Lieutenant in the Army Ordnance Corps. He later served in the OSS in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations during World War II. He was discharged in September 1945 as a Lieutenant Colonel. Writing career. Early pulp story. MacDonald's literary career began accidentally; in 1945, while in military service, he wrote a short story and mailed it home to his wife. He had grown tired of trying to write when everything had to pass the military censors. She submitted it to ""Esquire"" magazine, where it was rejected, and then she submitted it to ""Story"" magazine. It was accepted for $25.00. He was informed of this just after disembarking from the ship home.  After his discharge from service, MacDonald spent the next four months writing short stories, generating some 800,000 words and losing while typing during 14-hour daily sessions, seven days a week. This effort netted him only hundreds of rejection slips, but in the fifth month, a $40 sale to the pulp magazine ""Dime Detective (magazine)"" set his career in motion, and he continued to sell close to 500 short stories to the detective, mystery, adventure, sports, Western, and science fiction pulps. In a couple of instances, MacDonald's stories were the only ones in an issue of the magazine, but hidden via pseudonyms. Hardboiled thrillers. As the boom in paperback novels expanded, MacDonald successfully made the jump to longer fiction with his first novel, ""The Brass Cupcake"", published in 1950, by Fawcett Publications' Gold Medal Books.  His science fiction included the story ""Cosmetics"" in ""Astounding"" (1948) and the three novels ""Wine of the Dreamers"" (1951), ""Ballroom of the Skies"" (1952), and "" The Girl, the Gold Watch, & Everything"" (1962), which were collected as an omnibus in ""Time and Tomorrow"" (1980). Between 1953 and 1964, MacDonald specialized in crime thrillers, many of which are now considered masterpieces of the hardboiled genre. Most of these novels were published as paperback originals, although some were later republished in hardbound editions. Many, such as ""Dead Low Tide"" (1953), were set in his adopted home of Florida, and were effective in suggesting a sinister aura lurking beneath the glittery surface of that state. Novels such as ""The Executioners"" (1957) (which was twice filmed as ""Cape Fear"", first in 1962 and again in 1991) and ""One Monday We Killed Them All"" (1962) penetrated the minds of psychopathic killers. As MacDonald honed his craft, he developed his narrative ""voice,"" one of the most distinctive in the suspense fiction field. He is credited with writing about the effect of the building boom on the environment, and his novel ""A Flash of Green"" (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1962) is a good example of this effort. Many later Florida crime, detective and mystery writers, such as Randy Wayne White, James Hall and Jonathon King, have followed suit. Travis McGee. MacDonald's protagonists were often intelligent and introspective men, sometimes with a hard cynical streak. Travis McGee, the ""salvage consultant"" and ""knight-errant,"" was all of that. McGee made his living by recovering the loot from thefts and swindles, keeping half to finance his ""retirement,"" which he took in pieces as he went along. He first appeared in the 1964 novel ""The Deep Blue Good-by"" and was last seen in ""The Lonely Silver Rain"" in 1985. All titles in the 21-volume series include a color, a mnemonic device which was suggested by his publisher so that when harried travelers in airports looked to buy a book, they could at once see those MacDonald titles they had not yet read. The McGee novels feature an ever-changing array of female companions, some particularly nasty villains, exotic locales in Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean, and appearances by a sidekick known only as ""Meyer,"" an economist of international renown and a Ph.D. As Sherlock Holmes had his well-known address on Baker Street, McGee had his trademark lodgings on his houseboat, the ""Busted Flush"", named for the poker hand that started the run of luck in which he won her. She is docked at Slip F-18, Bahia Mar marina, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Death. MacDonald died at the age of 70, on December 28, 1986, at St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from complications of an earlier heart bypass operation. Media adaptations. Thrillers and science fiction. MacDonald's novel ""Soft Touch"" was the basis for the 1961 film ""Man-Trap"".  His 1957 novel ""The Executioners"" was filmed in 1962 as ""Cape Fear"", a dark thriller of strong suspense and menace starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. Martin Scorsese directed the 1991 remake of ""Cape Fear"".  The novel ""Cry Hard, Cry Fast"" was adapted as a two-part episode of the TV series ""Run for Your Life"" in November 1967. The novella ""Linda"" was filmed twice for television, in 1973 (with Stella Stevens in the title role) and 1993 (with Virginia Madsen).  ""The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything"" was adapted for a 1980 TV movie. It led to a 1981 sequel, ""The Girl, the Gold Watch and Dynamite"".  The 1980 TV movie ""Condominium"", based on MacDonald's novel, starred Dan Haggerty and Barbara Eden. The 1984 ""A Flash of Green"" with Ed Harris. Travis McGee. When Travis McGee arrived on the big screen in 1970 with ""Darker Than Amber"", starring Rod Taylor, the film received favorable reviews from Roger Ebert and other critics, but there was no follow-up into a series. The 1983 TV movie ""Travis McGee: The Empty Copper Sea"" starred Sam Elliott. Influence. Various writers have acknowledged the trail that MacDonald and McGee blazed, including Carl Hiaasen in an introduction to a 1990s edition of ""The Deep Blue Good-by"": ""Most readers loved MacDonald's work because he told a rip-roaring yarn. I loved it because he was the first modern writer to nail Florida dead-center, to capture all its languid sleaze, racy sense of promise, and breath-grabbing beauty."" Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., wrote another memorable tribute: ""To diggers a thousand years from now . . . the works of John D. MacDonald would be a treasure on the order of the tomb of Tutankhamen.""  Most of the current crop of Florida-based mystery writers acknowledge a debt to MacDonald, including Randy Wayne White, James Hall, Les Standiford, Jonathon King and Tim Dorsey. Lawrence Block's New York-based fictional hero, Matthew Scudder, is a character who makes his living doing just what McGee does—favors for friends who have no other recourse, then taking his cut. Homage to MacDonald was evident in the 1981-88 CBS-TV series ""Simon & Simon"" with scenes showing Rick Simon's boat docked at Slip F-18 in San Diego. Stephen King stated in the book ""Faces of Fear"": ""John D. MacDonald has written a novel called ""The End of the Night"" which I would argue is one of the greatest American novels of the twentieth century. It ranks with ""Death of a Salesman"", it ranks with ""An American Tragedy""."" The science fiction writer Spider Robinson has made it clear that he is also among MacDonald's admirers. The bartender in Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, Mike Callahan, is married to Lady Sally McGee, whose last name is almost certainly a tribute to Travis. In a recent sequel to the Callahan's series, ""Callahan's Key"", a group of regulars from the former saloon decide they've had enough of Long Island, so they move to Key West, Florida, in a colorful caravan of modified school buses. On their way to Key West, they stop at a marina near Fort Lauderdale specifically to visit Slip F-18 (where ""Busted Flush"" was usually moored) and meet a local who was the prototype for McGee's sidekick Meyer. The slip is empty, with a small plaque mentioning ""Busted Flush"". The popular mystery writer Dean Koontz has also acknowledged in an interview with Bookreporter.com's Marlene Taylor that MacDonald is ""(His) favorite author of all time... I've read everything he wrote four or five times."" Bibliography. Travis McGee novels. In chronological order: "
wikipedia-383893," Cyan Worlds  Cyan Worlds, Inc. (formerly Cyan, Inc.) is an American video game development company, founded by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller in 1987, and best known as the creators of the ""Myst"" series. After ""Myst"" and its sequel ""Riven"" sold several million copies each, Cyan went on to create the massively multiplayer online adventure, """", which was cancelled and re-opened several times. To clarify new directions for the company, CEO Rand Miller changed the name from ""Cyan"" to ""Cyan Worlds,"" after the release of ""Riven"". The company is located in Mead, Washington, just outside Spokane. History. Pre-Myst. Founded in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, Cyan originally produced adventure games for children. The company's early titles, ""The Manhole"" (1988), ""Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel"" (1989) and ""Spelunx"" (1991) were whimsical fantasy adventures for a young audience. The games offered numerous graphical screens with puzzles, mini-games and activities. Some of these titles were early forays of Cyan into both construction of interactive worlds using HyperCard, and the CD-ROM medium, both of which would later be used for ""Myst"". Myst franchise. In 1993, Cyan shot to worldwide fame with the release of ""Myst"", a 3D pre-rendered adventure game aimed at an older audience unlike their previous games. ""Myst"" was one of the earliest CD-ROM games, in a time when CD-ROM drives were beginning to become mainstream. The title sold more than six million copies, and was the best-selling PC game ever until ""The Sims"" exceeded its sales in 2002. With the revenue from ""Myst"", Cyan quickly moved to a new headquarters to accommodate a bigger staff, where they remain today. During this time, three novels set in the ""Myst"" universe were co-authored by the Millers and David Wingrove. ""Riven: The Sequel to Myst"", was released in 1997. This same year, company co-founder Robyn Miller left Cyan to pursue other interests, ten years after he began ""The Manhole"". The next eight years saw a huge amount of expansion in the ""Myst"" franchise, both from within and outside of Cyan. While the publishing rights were transferred from Brøderbund to Mattel, and then to Ubisoft, Cyan prepared for the next game in the Myst universe, which was to be a massively multiplayer online game, and not a direct sequel to ""Myst"". During this time, the company changed its name to ""Cyan Worlds"". Partly as a test of their new real-time 3D engine, Cyan released ""realMyst"" in 2000, a complete recreation of the original ""Myst"" game. At the same time, the next ""Myst"" game, """", was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft, and released in 2001. In 2003, Cyan announced that their multiplayer adventure, ""Uru"", formerly known under the working titles ""DIRT"" (""D'ni In Real Time""), ""Mudpie"" (""Multi-User DIRT – Persistent Interactive Environment""), ""Parable"" and ""Myst Online"", would be split into separate single-player and multiplayer components, at the request of the publisher Ubisoft. The single-player component, """", was released later that year. The multiplayer component, ""Uru Live"" had a short beta test, but was cancelled before being officially released. In 2004, Cyan released two ' expansion packs (""To D'ni"" and ""The Path of the Shell"") that included content originally intended for the online component. The same year, Ubisoft independently developed and released ', the second game in the series not developed by Cyan. In the following year, Cyan developed the final chapter in the Myst series, """". After ""Myst V"", the company laid off most of its employees due to financial difficulties, but shortly after rehired almost everyone after negotiating a deal with Turner Broadcasting. Prior to this, the company was working on an as yet unannounced project (reportedly named ""Latus"" by Richard A. Watson) and negotiating with an undisclosed publisher, but its status is now unclear, though Rand Miller made mention of it in August 2011 and confirmed its name as Latus. Post-Myst. After ""Uru Live"" closed, fans began developing their own server software. In response to this demand, Cyan Worlds released ""Untìl Uru"" in late 2004, a modified version of the client and server software of ""Live"". This version of the game was unsupported – servers were owned and operated by fans, and no new content was provided. Later, through funding by GameTap, Cyan managed to offer the ""D'mala"" shard, an official game server. Fans also began developing new content for the game, in an unofficial context.

Despite this success, GameTap announced on February 4, 2008, that it would be closing ""Uru Live"". Game servers remained online for 60 days following, and were finally shut down on April 10, 2008.

wikipedia-383899," Seth MacFarlane  Seth Woodbury MacFarlane (; born October 26, 1973) is an American actor, voice actor, animator, screenwriter, comedian, producer, director, and singer. He is the creator of the show ""Family Guy"" (1999–2002, 2005–present) and co-creator of ""American Dad!"" (2005–present) and ""The Cleveland Show"" (2009–2013), for which he also voices many of the shows' various characters. A native of Kent, Connecticut, MacFarlane is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design where he studied animation, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Recruited to Hollywood during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert, he was an animator and writer for Hanna-Barbera for several television shows, including ""Johnny Bravo"", ""Cow and Chicken"", ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""I Am Weasel"" and his own ""Family Guy"" sort-of 'prequel', ""Larry and Steve"". MacFarlane created his own series for 20th Century Fox called ""Family Guy"" in 1999. MacFarlane went on to co-create ""American Dad!"" in 2005 along with Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the ""Animation Domination"" lineup on Fox. Also for the same network lineup, he co-created ""The Cleveland Show"" in 2009. He later served as executive producer on the Fox sitcom ""The Winner"". As an actor, he has made guest appearances on shows such as ""Gilmore Girls"", ""The War at Home"" and ""FlashForward"". MacFarlane's interest in science fiction and fantasy has led to cameo and guest appearances on ' and voicing the character of Johann Kraus in Guillermo del Toro's '. In 2008, he created his own YouTube series entitled ""Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy"". As a singer MacFarlane has performed at several venues, including Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. MacFarlane has won several awards for his work on ""Family Guy"", including two Primetime Emmy Awards and an Annie Award. In 2009 he won the Webby Award for Film & Video Person of the Year. He occasionally speaks at universities and colleges throughout the United States, and he is a supporter of gay rights. On an episode of ""Conan"" that aired on February 10, 2011, MacFarlane announced that he was directing his first feature-length comedy film, ""Ted"". The film stars Mark Wahlberg as an adult who, as a kid, wished his teddy bear would come to life. MacFarlane voiced and provided motion capture for the bear. It was released on June 29, 2012, and went on to become the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time. In September 2011, MacFarlane released a debut album of American standards, ""Music Is Better Than Words"". Also in 2011 he began a revival of Hanna-Barbera's ""The Flintstones"" for the Fox network. The first episode was due to air in the U.S. in 2013, but production has been indefinitely delayed due to MacFarlane's schedule. Early life and education. Seth Woodbury MacFarlane was born in Kent, Connecticut. His parents, Ann Perry (née Sager, 1947-2010) and Ronald Milton MacFarlane (1946- ), were born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. He has a younger sister, Rachael MacFarlane. Some of his recent ancestors emigrated from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Quebec, Canada, and London, England; MacFarlane also descends from Mayflower passenger William Brewster. MacFarlane's parents met in 1970, when they both lived and worked in Boston, Massachusetts, and married later that year. The couple moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann Perry began working in the Admissions Office at South Kent School. She later worked in the College Guidance and Admissions Offices at the Kent School, a selective college preparatory school where Ronald also was a teacher. During his childhood, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration and began drawing cartoon characters Fred Flintstone and Woody Woodpecker, as early as two years old. By the age of five, MacFarlane knew that he would want to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating flip books, after his parents found a book on the subject. Four years later, aged nine, MacFarlane began publishing a weekly comic strip entitled ""Walter Crouton"" for ""The Kent Good Times Dispatch"", the local newspaper in Kent, Connecticut, which paid him five dollars per week. In one anecdote from the time, MacFarlane said in a 2011 interview he was ""always like just weirdly fascinated by the Communion ceremony I did a strip that had a guy kneeling at the altar taking Communion and saying 'Can I have fries with that?' And to my 11-year-old brain that was comedy ..."" The paper printed it and he got ""an angry letter from our local priest ... It created sort of a little mini-controversy in our little town."" MacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School. While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and was given an 8 mm camera by his parents. MacFarlane went on to study film, video and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. As a student, he had originally intended to work for Disney, but changed his mind upon graduating. At RISD MacFarlane created a series of independent films, eventually meeting future ""Family Guy"" cast member Mike Henry, whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate. In his senior year at RISD MacFarlane created a thesis film entitled ""The Life of Larry"", which eventually would become the inspiration for ""Family Guy"". MacFarlane's professor submitted his film to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera, where he was later hired. Film career. Hanna-Barbera years. After college MacFarlane was hired at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of ""The Life of Larry"", rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent. He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network's ""Cartoon Cartoons"" series. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an ""old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another"". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: ""Dexter's Laboratory"", ""Cow and Chicken"", ""I Am Weasel"" and ""Johnny Bravo"". Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on ""Johnny Bravo"". He found it easier to develop his own style at ""Johnny Bravo"" through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ""Dexter's Laboratory"", ""Cow and Chicken"" and ""I Am Weasel"" did not use. As a part of the ""Johnny Bravo"" crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ""Family Guy"" series. He also did freelance work for Walt Disney Television Animation, writing for ""Jungle Cubs"", and for Nelvana, where he wrote for """". Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ""Ace Ventura""). MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ""Zoomates"" for Frederator Studios' ""Oh Yeah! Cartoons"" on Nickelodeon. In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ""The Life of Larry"" entitled ""Larry and Steve"", which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of Cartoon Network's ""World Premiere Toons"". Executives at Fox saw both ""Larry"" shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series. ""Family Guy"". Although MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched ""Family Guy"" to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was trying to get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Collins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of ""King of the Hill"" in 1997, MacFarlane called Collins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of $50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least $1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with ""The New York Times"", MacFarlane stated, ""I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot"". After six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a ""very, very simply, crudely animated film – with just enough to get the tone of the show across"" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and ordered the series immediately. In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of ""Family Guy"" for a January 1999 debut. ""Family Guy"" was originally intended to be a series of shorts on ""MADtv"", much in the same way ""The Simpsons"" had begun on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's ""MADtv"" connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns. At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer. ""Family Guy"" first aired January 31, 1999. MacFarlane's work in animating ""Family Guy"" has been influenced by Jackie Gleason and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from ""The Simpsons"" and ""All in the Family"". In addition to writing three episodes, ""Death Has a Shadow"", ""Family Guy Viewer Mail 1"" and ""North by North Quahog"", MacFarlane voices ""Family Guy""'s main characters – Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin and Glenn Quagmire as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake and additional characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and established fan loyalty, ""Family Guy"" developed into a $1-billion franchise. On May 4, 2008, after approximately two and a half years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a $100-million agreement with Fox to keep ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" until 2012. The agreement makes him the world's highest paid television writer. MacFarlane's success with ""Family Guy"" has opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer Walter Murphy created """". The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track ""Stewie's Sexy Party"". A fan of Broadway musicals, MacFarlane comments on using musicals as a component to ""Family Guy"": In addition, a ""Family Guy"" video game was released in 2006. Two years later, in August 2007, he closed a digital content production deal with AdSense. MacFarlane takes cast members on the road to voice characters in front of live audiences. ""Family Guy Live"" provides fans with the opportunity to hear future scripts. In mid-2007 Chicago fans had the opportunity to hear the then upcoming sixth season premiere ""Blue Harvest"". Shows have been played in Montreal, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On July 22, 2007, in an interview with ""The Hollywood Reporter"", MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although ""nothing's official"". In September 2007, Ricky Blitt gave TV.com an interview confirming that he had already started working on the script. Then in ""TV Week"" on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released ""Family Guy"" feature film sometime ""within the next year"". He came up with an idea for the story, ""something that you could not do on the show, which him is the only reason to do a movie"". He later went on to say he imagines the film to be ""an old-style musical with dialogue"" similar to ""The Sound of Music"", saying that he would ""really be trying to capture, musically, that feel"". Despite its popularity, ""Family Guy"" has not been immune to criticism. The Parents Television Council frequently criticizes the show for its content, once organized a letter-writing campaign aimed at removing it from FOX's lineup, and has filed complaints with the Federal Communications Commission alleging that some episodes of the show contained indecent content. MacFarlane has responded to the PTC's criticism by saying, among other things, ""That's like getting hate mail from Hitler. They're literally terrible human beings."" ""Family Guy"" has been cancelled twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider. MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers each time Fox approved the show. ""One of the positive aspects of 'Family Guy' constantly being pulled off air is that we were always having to restaff writers"". During the sixth season, episodes of ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad!"" were delayed from regular broadcast due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike (which MacFarlane participated in to support the writers while FOX aired three ""Family Guy"" episodes without MacFarlane's permission). On February 12, 2008, the strike ended, and the series resumed airing regularly, beginning with ""Back to the Woods"". ""American Dad!"". MacFarlane has a second long-running, successful adult animated series in ""American Dad!"" which has been in production since early 2005. To date, ""American Dad!"" is MacFarlane's only animated series never to have suffered a cancellation. Though ""American Dad!"" will undergo a network relocation from Fox to TBS in late 2014, following the show's current 10th season (2013–14). As announced on July 16, 2013, TBS has picked up the adult animation for a 15-episode 11th season. MacFarlane co-created the series along with Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman. While he regularly does extensive voice acting work for the program, MacFarlane has left much of the show's creative direction up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity. ""American Dad!"" was first shown after Super Bowl XXXIX, debuting with the episode ""Pilot."" Somewhat of an early sneak preview, the series premiere aired on February 6, 2005. However, the program wouldn't begin airing regularly as part of the ""Animation Domination"" lineup on Fox until May 1, 2005. Because of atypical scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, ""American Dad!"" has a controversial season number discrepancy in which many are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between ""American Dad!"" creators and the show's official website from Fox. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, ""American Dad!"" co-creator Mike Barker hinted that an ""American Dad!"" movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. MacFarlane has described the initial seasons of ""American Dad!"" as being similar to ""All in the Family"", likening title character Stan Smith's originally bigoted persona to Archie Bunker. MacFarlane has also stated that his inspiration to create ""American Dad!"" derived from his and Weitzman's exasperation with George W. Bush's policies as former United States President. After the early couple of seasons however, the series discontinued using these elements of political satire and began to serve up its own very distinguished brand of entertainment and humor. MacFarlane was described as having difficulty understanding the series in its early going; however, he heavily warmed up to the series after its early seasons once he felt the show truly came into its own. His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed to being a huge ""American Dad!"" fan himself. He has taken note of the increasing fondness and excitement over the ""Roger"" character from fans via his Twitter. The show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the insanely drastic, endangering, dog-eat-dog, rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's breadwinner, he works as a CIA officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show known for its story arc elements and other distinguishing plot techniques); Stan's paradoxically moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, Francine; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter Hayley and nerdy son Steve. Accompanied with the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which are non-human species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien Roger, who's full of disguises/alter egos and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from Area 51; Klaus, the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus's unenviable situation came about from a brain of an East German Olympic skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and Jeff Fischer, Hayley's boyfriend turned ""whipped"" husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley's mom, Francine. Together, the Smiths and their three housemates run what is only at a first glance the typical middle-class American lifestyle, but is anything but. Seth MacFarlane provides the voices of Stan and Roger, basing Roger's voice on Paul Lynde (who played Uncle Arthur in ""Bewitched""). His sister Rachael MacFarlane provides the voice of Hayley. ""The Cleveland Show"". MacFarlane developed the now cancelled ""Family Guy"" spin-off called ""The Cleveland Show"", which focuses on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by ""Family Guy"" writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the back nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. This is also the only series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character. ""The Winner"". MacFarlane was the executive producer of a live-action sitcom starring Rob Corddry called ""The Winner"". The show premiered on Fox on March 4, 2007. The plot has a man named Glen discussing the time he matured at 32 and has him pursuing his only love after she moves in next door. Glen meets her son and both become good friends. After six episodes, the show was officially cancelled on May 16, 2007. However, at ""Family Guy Live"" in Montreal on July 21, 2007, Seth MacFarlane stated, ""It is looking like there could be a future life for ""The Winner"""". After MacFarlane's statement, neither Fox nor MacFarlane has released any details of plans for the show to return. The show was mentioned in the ""Family Guy"" episode ""Family Gay"", where all of the horses at a racing track are named after failed Fox shows, ""The Winner"" being one of them. ""Dads"". In 2013, MacFarlane announced that he will be working on a live-action sitcom called ""Dads"". The series, which has been given the go-ahead for a six-episode season, revolves around Eli, played by Seth Green and Warner, played by Giovanni Ribisi, two successful guys in their 30's whose world is turned upside down when their dads move in with them. MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild are executive producing the series, with Sulkin and Wild writing. ""Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy"". On September 10, 2008, MacFarlane released a series of webisodes known as ""Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy"" with its animated shorts sponsored by Burger King and released weekly. ""Ted"". MacFarlane made his directorial live-action film debut with the release of ""Ted"" in 2012. Along with directing the film, he also wrote the screenplay, served as producer and starred as the titular character. The film tells the story of John (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking teddy bear (MacFarlane) who keeps John and his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) from moving on with their lives. It received generally favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and was a box office success, opening with the highest weekend gross of all time for an original R-rated comedy. The movie is currently the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time, beating ""The Hangover Part II"". ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". It has been announced that he is planning on co-writing and starring in his second film, called ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild are also co-writers for the film. The movie follows a cowardly sheep farmer (MacFarlane) who chickens out of a gunfight and sees his girlfriend leave him for another man. When a mysterious woman rides into town, she helps him find his courage. But when her outlaw husband arrives seeking revenge, the farmer must put his newfound courage to the test. Other work. MacFarlane usually participates as one of the ""roasters"" in the annual Comedy Central Roasts.

However, at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2012, while promoting ""Ted"", MacFarlane revealed that the project had been shelved, due to the unimpressed response garnered by the production company, Fox. In August 2011, Fox announced that they had ordered a 13-part updated series of """" which MacFarlane will co-produce with Ann Druyan and Steven Soter. The new series will be hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson and is expected to begin airing on the channel in 2013, with repeats airing on the National Geographic Channel on the same night.

He went on to say, ""I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time"". MacFarlane continued, ""Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?"" MacFarlane, in recognition of ""his active, passionate commitment to Humanist values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues"", was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011. Despite his position on gay rights, MacFarlane was criticized for his portrayal of transsexualism in the ""Family Guy"" episode ""Quagmire's Dad"". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — as well as a scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be transgender (a satirical reference to the iconic film ""The Crying Game"") — to be ""shockingly insensitive"". Hartinger continued, ""Frankly, it's literally ""impossible"" for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot"". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared ""serious concerns being voiced from members of the community"" about the episode. MacFarlane said he was ""surprised"" by the negative reaction to ""Quagmire's Dad"", saying that ""it seemed that commentators were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character"". He further added, ""Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"" 2008 Writers Guild of America strike. During the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, MacFarlane publicly sided with the Writers Guild, and fully participated in the strike. Official production of ""Family Guy"" was halted for most of December 2007 and various periods afterwards. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, and although he refused to work on the show during the strike, his contract with Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it subsequently produced. Rumors of continued production on ""Family Guy"" prompted the statement from MacFarlane that ""...it would just be a colossal dick move if they did that"". The strike ended on February 12, 2008. The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive. MacFarlane donated money to create The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive at the Library of Congress.  MacFarlane said, ""The work of Carl Sagan has been a profound influence in my life, and the life of every individual who recognizes the importance of humanity's ongoing commitment to the exploration of our universe,"" He also, said, ""The continuance of our journey outward into space should always occupy some part of our collective attention, regardless of whatever Snooki did last week."" Personal life. MacFarlane identifies himself as a ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"" and science fiction fan. He appeared at a ""Star Wars"" convention to promote his new ""Family Guy"" episode ""Blue Harvest"" on May 26, 2007. MacFarlane's interest in science fiction and music are regular themes for his birthday and Christmas parties in Los Angeles. In 2009 he held a ""Star Wars""-themed Christmas party. In 2010 he held a Rat Pack-themed party for his birthday with a 60-piece orchestra and performance by Frank Sinatra, Jr. MacFarlane is an outspoken atheist, and many of his works have been critical of religion in general, although he has stated that he is not anti-religious. In a 2004 interview with ""The Daily Princetonian"", MacFarlane noted his similarities to Brian Griffin on ""Family Guy"", revealing, ""I have some Brian type issues from time to time – looking for the right person – but I date as much as the next guy"". MacFarlane has also revealed that Brian is his favorite character from Family Guy, because he feels most comfortable when playing that role. In early 2007, fellow comedian Alex Borstein reported in an interview that MacFarlane is old-fashioned in several aspects of his life in that ""his pop culture knowledge is very retro. Seth doesn't have e-mail at home, doesn't own a computer, and he doesn't really watch television. He doesn't understand MySpace and despises most new music."" On July 16, 2010, MacFarlane's mother, Ann Perry MacFarlane, died after a long battle with cancer. Her death was reported by Larry King on his show ""Larry King Live"", who acknowledged a conversation he had with her during an interview with her son in May 2010. A brief opening scene from the first episode of the ninth season of ""Family Guy"" (""And Then There Were Fewer"") mentions her lifespan, and dedicates the episode to her. September 11, 2001 experience. On the morning of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was scheduled to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover from the previous night's celebrations, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15 a.m. instead of 7:45 a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46 a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, obliterating the airplane, and killing everyone on board. In an interview with TVShowsOnDVD.com, MacFarlane said the following about his close call: Lawsuits. On October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing ""Family Guy"" of infringing its copyright on the song ""When You Wish upon a Star"", through a parody song entitled ""I Need a Jew"" appearing in the episode ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a ""thinly veiled"" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, and Walter Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that ""I Need a Jew"" uses the copyrighted melody of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in ""Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc."" On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that ""Family Guy"" did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode. In December 2007, ""Family Guy"" was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in """", in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature ""magic"" act involving absurd ""faux"" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune ""Fine and Dandy"". MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox, Steve Callaghan, and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit. In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—""purpose and character of the use"", ""nature of the infringed work"", and ""amount and substantiality of the taking""—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—""economic impact""—had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers—not Metrano or his act. The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms. "
wikipedia-383902," Modified Frequency Modulation  Modified Frequency Modulation, commonly MFM, is a run-length limited (RLL) coding scheme used to encode the actual data-bits on most floppy disks. It was first introduced in disk drives with the IBM 3330 hard disk drive in 1970. Floppy disk drive hardware examples include Amiga, most CP/M machines as well as IBM PC compatibles.  MFM is a modification to the original FM (frequency modulation) scheme for encoding data on single-density floppy disks and some early hard disk drives. Due to the minimum spacing between flux transitions that is a property of the disk and head design, MFM, which guarantees at most one flux transition per data bit, can be written at higher density than FM, which can require two transitions per data bit. It is used with a data rate of kbit/s ( kbit/s encoded) on industry standard 5¼"" and 3½"" ordinary and high density diskettes. MFM was also used in early hard disk designs, before the advent of more efficient types of run-length limited coding. Except for the steadily disappearing 880 kiB and 1.4 MiB floppy disk formats, MFM encoding is obsolete in magnetic recording. Coding. As is standard when discussing hard drive encoding schemes, FM and MFM encodings produce a bit stream which is NRZI encoded when written to disk. A 1 bit represents a magnetic transition, and a 0 bit no transition. Data encoding has to balance two factors: Both FM and MFM encodings can also be thought of as having data bits separated by clock bits, but with different rules for encoding the bits. Still, both formats encode each data bit as two bits on disk (because of delimiters that are required at the beginning and end of a sequence, the actual density is slightly lower). The basic encoding rule for FM is that all clock bits are 1: zeros are encoded as 10, ones are encoded as 11. The number of magnetic transitions per bit is on average 1.5 (50%*1 + 50%*2). The basic encoding rule for MFM is that (x, y, z, ...) encodes to (x, x NOR y, y, y NOR z, z, z NOR...). A zero is encoded as 10 if preceded by a zero, and 00 if preceded by a one (each of these cases occurs 25% of the time); a one is always encoded as 01 (which happens 50% of the time); thus the number of magnetic transitions is on average 0.75 (25%*1 + 25%*0 + 50%*1). Note that the surrounding clock bits are sometimes known, but sometimes require knowledge of the adjacent data bits. A longer example: In FM encoding, the number of 0 bits that may appear between consecutive 1 bits is either 0 or 1. In MFM encoding there is a minimum of 1 zero bit between adjacent ones (there are never two adjacent one bits), and the maximum number of zeros in a row is 3. Thus, FM is a (0,1) RLL code, while MFM is a (1,3) code. A special “sync mark” is used to allow the disk controller to figure out where the data starts. This sync mark must follow the RLL code so that the controller can recognize it, but it does not follow the FM and MFM rules for clock bits. This way, it will never occur in any bit position in any encoded data stream. The shortest possible sync bit pattern, which follows the (1,3) RLL coding rules but cannot be produced by normal MFM coding, is 100010010001. In fact, the sync mark that is commonly used in MFM encoding starts with these twelve bits; it is called an “A1 sync” since the data bits form the hexadecimal value A1 (10100001), but the fifth clock bit is different from the normal encoding of the A1 byte. MMFM. MMFM, (Modified Modified Frequency Modulation), also abbreviated M²FM, or M2FM, is similar to MFM, but suppresses additional clock bits, producing a longer maximum run length (a (1,4) RLL code). In particular, a clock pulse is only inserted between a pair of adjacent 0 bits if the first bit of the pair did not have a clock pulse inserted before it. In the example below, clock bits that would have been present in MFM are noted in bold:  In this system, sync marks are made by inserting additional clock pulses between adjacent zero bits (following the MFM rule) where they would normally be omitted. In particular, the data bit pattern ""10001"" has a clock pulse inserted in the middle, where it would normally be omitted: "
wikipedia-383906," Honorificabilitudinitatibus  Honorificabilitudinitatibus is the dative and ablative plural of the mediaeval Latin word ""honorificabilitudinitas"", which can be translated as ""the state of being able to achieve honours"". It is mentioned by the character Costard in Act V, Scene I of William Shakespeare's ""Love's Labour's Lost"". As it appears only once in Shakespeare's works, it is a hapax legomenon in the Shakespeare canon. It is also the longest word in the English language featuring alternating consonants and vowels. Use in ""Love's Labour's Lost"". The word is spoken by the comic rustic Costard in Act V, Scene 1 of the play. It is used after an absurdly pretentious dialogue between the pedantic schoolmaster Holofernes and his friend Sir Nathaniel. The two pedants converse in a mixture of Latin and florid English. When Moth, a witty young servant, enters, Costard says of the pedants, ""O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words. I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word; for thou art not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier swallowed than a flap-dragon."" Flap-dragon was a game which involved trying to eat hot raisins from a bowl of burning brandy. Use in Baconianism. The word has been used by adherents of the Baconian theory—who believe Shakespeare's plays were written in steganographic cypher by Francis Bacon. In 1905 Isaac Hull Platt argued that it was an anagram for ""hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi"", Latin for ""these plays, F. Bacon's offspring, are preserved for the world"". His argument was given wide circulation by Edwin Durning-Lawrence in 1910, complete with a cryptonumerical attempt to prove it justified. The anagram assumes that Bacon would have Latinized his name as ""Baco"" (the genitive case of which is ""Baconis"") rather than as ""Baconus"" (the genitive of which would be ""Baconi""). Samuel Schoenbaum argues that Bacon would have Latinized his name as ""Baconus"", with genitive ""Baconi"". It is far from the only possible anagram. John Sladek noted in the 1970s that the word could also be anagrammatized as ""I, B. Ionsonii, uurit [""writ""] a lift'd batch"", thus ""proving"" that Shakespeare's works were written by Ben Jonson. (The two ""u""s, rendered as ""v""s in the original literation, are put together to form - literally - ""a double u"" (w), as was common practice in Shakespeare's day.) In 2012, a columnist writing on the English language in the Calcutta 'Telegraph', Stephen Hugh-Jones, mocked it with the deliberately anachronistic ""If I built it in, is author ID Bacon?"", attributing this to a derisive William Shakespeare; and counter-""proved"" that Shakespeare wrote Bacon by converting the latter's famous opening phrase ""What is truth, said jesting Pilate..."" into ""Truth? A lasting jape. Hide it. WS"".  Other uses. Historical. Long before ""Love's Labour's Lost"", ""honorificabilitudo"" appears in a Latin charter of 1187, and occurs as ""honorificabilitudinitas"" in 1300. Dante cites ""honorificabilitudinitate"" as a typical example of a long word in ""De Vulgari Eloquentia"" II. vii. It also occurs in the works of Rabelais and in ""The Complaynt of Scotland"" (1549). The year after the publication of ""Love's Labours Lost"" it is used by Thomas Nashe in his 1599 pamphlet ""Nashe’s Lenten Stuff"": ""Physicians deafen our ears with the Honorificabilitudinitatibus of their heavenly Panacaea, their sovereign Guiacum"", referring to the exotic medicinal plant Guaiacum, the name of which was also ""exotic"", being the first Native American word imported into the English language. The word also appears in Marston's ""Dutch Courtezan"" (1605). Modern. James Joyce also used this word in his mammoth novel ""Ulysses"", during the Scylla and Charybdis episode when Stephen Dedalus articulates his interpretation of ""Hamlet"". In 1993 ""U.S. News & World Report"" used the word in its original meaning with reference to a debate about new words being used in the game of Scrabble: ""Honorificabilitudinity and the requirements of Scrabble fans dictated that the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary's makers be open-minded enough to include dweeb (a boringly conventional person), droob (an unprepossessing or contemptible person, esp. a man), and droog (a member of a gang: a young ruffian)."" In reality, however, it contains more letters of the alphabet than what the Scrabble board can accommodate. ""Jeff Noon""'s 2001 book of experimental poetry, ""Cobralingus"" used the fictional Cobralingus Engine to remix this word in the style of electronic music to create a prose poem entitled Pornostatic Processor. In Suzanne Selfors' 2011 children's novel ""Smells Like Treasure"", her spelling champion character, Hercules Simple, uses the word to describe the main character in the book. "
wikipedia-383916," Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: ""Federacija Bosne i Hercegovine"" ; Cyrillic script: Федерација Босне и Херцеговине) is one of the two political entities that compose the sovereign country of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the other entity is the Republika Srpska). The two entities are delineated by the Inter-Entity Boundary Line. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is inhabited primarily by Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, which is why it is sometimes informally referred to as the Bosniak-Croat Federation (with the Bosnian Serbs as the third constituency of the entity). The Federation was created by the Washington accords signed on 18 March 1994 ending the part of the conflict whereby Bosnian Croats fought with Bosniaks. It established a constituent assembly that continued its work until October 1996. The Federation has a capital, government, president, parliament, customs and police departments, two postal systems and airline (BH Airlines). It used to have its own army, the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though along with the Army of the Republika Srpska it merged into Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 6 June 2006. History. Bosnian War. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army attacked Croatia from Bosnia and Herzegovina.. First target was Croatian village Ravno that was attacked on 2 November 1991 and completely destroyed. Yugoslavia made economic blockade on Bosnia and Herzegovina thus trying to keep it as part of Yugoslavia. Later, Yugoslavia claimed territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Serb majority and capital Sarajevo. Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was declared on 27 March 1992 with goal to include parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Yugoslavia. Plan of Serbian politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina was to unite illegal Serbian autonomous provinces into the single unit that would join Yugoslavia and with total blockade of Sarajevo break Bosnia and Herzegovina into the smaller, unconnected and hardly defensible enclaves. Because of superiority in armament, support from Belgrade and embargo on import of arms in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbs achieved their goals already in June 1992. Bosniak leadership was still in indecision for major conflict, so Croats were first to oppose Serbian aggression. They organized military units, Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) in November 1991 and Croatian Defence Council in April 1992. Those units were partly composed of Bosniaks. The Territorial Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively organized in autumn of 1992. On Serb-controlled areas, Serbs executed mass murders, ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs, primarily Bosniaks and Croats, established concentration camps and destroyed Bosniak and Croat cultural inheritance. Until November 1992 Serbs conquered 70% of territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and held Sarajevo in hoop by terrorizing the population of Sarajevo by shelling and constant sniper fire. Relationship between Bosnians and Croats during the Serbian aggression decreased. The existing diversity was increased because of chaotic and war situation but also because of conflicting views and moves by individual leaders of both sides and United Nations. The creation of Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia was in dispute for Bosniaks. Croats accused Bosniaks for islamization of the country and attempts for Bosniak domination in all areas, so they withdrew Croat representatives from Parliament, Government and Presidency. Serbian aggression of Bosnia and Herzegovina had catastrophic consequences, primarily because of disrupted relation between nationalities and religious communities. By Serbian expulsion of Bosniaks, Bosniaks moved to other areas and thus disrupted living area of Croats and their pre-war ratio. Political disputes and minor incidents in central and northern Bosnia and in northern and central Herzegovina led to Croat-Bosniak War in November 1992. The Vance-Owen plan was presented in January 1993. It was planned to create 10 cantons on territory of all Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered large area which was under control of HVO; almost whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and wider area around those towns and Usora, part of Municipality of Travnik, Zavidovići and part of Municipality of Vareš) and part of Herzegovina, Konjic, Jablanica and eastern and northern parts of Mostar. Number of crimes against civilians were committed on both sides. Hostility between Croats and Bosniaks ended with mediation of the United States and sign of Washington Agreement on 18 March 1994. The cooperation between Croats and Bosniaks was renewed, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Bosniak and Croat-controlled area was established. There was also proposal to create a confederation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Croatia. The joint command of ARBiH, HVO and Croatian Army (HV) was established in March 1995. The closer cooperation between Croats and Bosniaks was made through the Split Agreement where Bosnia and Herzegovina allowed Croatian Army to free western part of Bosnia and Herzegovina with cooperation with ARBiH. After the Operation Storm, the Serbian hoop around Bihać was broken and Croatian and Bosnian armies continued to liberate western Bosnia. The UN unsuccessfully tried to establish peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by trying to make a successful structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina. UN showed a total inability when Serbs conquered UN-protected towns, Srebrenica and Žepa. Serbs also launched on UN-protected town of Bihać, but they were stopped by Croatian army during the Operation Storm. Joint Croatian-Bosnian military successes made peace negotiations possible. Washington Agreement. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed by the Washington Agreement of March 1994. Under the agreement, the combined territory held by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council forces was divided into ten autonomous cantons. The cantonal system was selected to prevent dominance by one ethnic group over another. In 1995, Bosnian government forces and Bosnian Croat forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina defeated forces of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, and this territory was added to the federation. By the Dayton Agreement of 1995, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was defined as one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and comprised 51% of the federation area. The Republika Srpska comprised the other 49%. On 8 March 2000, the Brčko District was formed as an autonomous entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina and it was created from part of the territory of both Bosnian entities. Brčko District is now a shared territory that belongs to both entities. Geography. Boundary. The Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) that distinguishes Bosnia and Herzegovina's two entities essentially runs along the military front lines as they existed at the end of the Bosnian War, with adjustments (most importantly in the western part of the country and around Sarajevo), as defined by the Dayton Agreement. The total length of the IEBL is approximately  km. The IEBL is an administrative demarcation and not controlled by the military or police and there is free movement across it. Cantons. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into ten cantons (Bosnian: ""kantoni"" Croatian: ""županije""): Five of the cantons (Una-Sana, Tuzla, Zenica-Doboj, Bosnian Podrinje and Sarajevo) are Bosniak majority cantons, three (Posavina, West Herzegovina and Canton 10) are Croat majority cantons, and two (Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva) are 'ethnically mixed', meaning there are special legislative procedures for protection of the constituent ethnic groups. A significant portion of Brčko District was also part of the Federation; however, when the district was created, it became shared territory of both entities, but it was not placed under control of either of the two, and is hence under direct jurisdiction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Currently the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has 79 municipalities. Cities and towns. List of largest cities and towns (with population in 2012): Demographics. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina comprises 51% of the land area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is home to 62.1% of the country's total population. All data dealing with population, including ethnic distributions, are subject to considerable error because of the lack of official census figures. Government and politics. The government and politics of the Federation are dominated by two large parties, the Bosniak Party for Democratic Action (""Stranka demokratske akcije"", SDA) and the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (""Hrvatska demokratska zajednica"", HDZ). Since the 2010 Bosnian elections, HDZBiH is in opposition, while SDA is the second largest party in FBiH. The biggest party in FBiH is the Socialdemocratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDPBiH) now. In September 2010, the International Crisis Group warned that ""disputes among and between Bosniak and Croat leaders and a dysfunctional administrative system have paralysed decision-making, put the entity on the verge of bankruptcy and triggered social unrest"". Symbols. The Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Coat of arms of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and were due to be replaced by September. On 31 March 2007, the Constitutional Court placed its decision into the ""Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina"" officially removing them. The federation has not yet adopted a new anthem or coat of arms, but uses the symbols of the central state as a provisional solution. "
wikipedia-383925," Hamilton Fish  Hamilton Fish (August 3, 1808September 7, 1893) was an American statesman and politician who served as the 16th Governor of New York, a United States Senator and United States Secretary of State. Fish has been considered one of the best Secretaries of State in the United States' history, known for his judiciousness and reform efforts during the Grant Administration. Fish settled the controversial Alabama Claims with Great Britain through his development of the concept of international arbitration. Fish kept the United States out of war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile Virginius Incident. In 1875, Fish initiated the process for Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's abundant sugar supply. Fish organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between South American countries and Spain. Fish worked with James Milton Turner, America's first African American consul, to settle the Liberian-Grebo war. President Grant stated that Hamilton Fish, above all, was the person whom he most trusted for political advice. Fish came from a prominent wealthy New York family and attended Columbia College of Columbia University. Upon graduation, Fish passed the bar, worked as New York's commissioner of deeds, and ran unsuccessfully for New York State Assembly as a Whig candidate in 1834. After his marriage, Fish returned to New York politics in 1843 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Fish ran for New York's Lieutenant Governor in 1846, however, he was defeated by a Democratic Anti-Rent Party contender. When the office was vacated in 1847, Fish ran and was elected Lieutenant Governor. In 1848 Fish ran and was elected Governor of New York having served only one term. In 1851, Fish was elected U.S. Senator for the state of New York and served only one term. Fish gained valuable experience serving on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. During the 1850s Fish became a Republican after the Whig party dissolved. In terms of the slavery issue, Fish was a moderate; having disapproved of the Kansas Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery. After traveling to Europe, Fish returned to America and supported Abraham Lincoln as the Republican candidate for President in 1860. During the American Civil War Fish raised money for the Union war effort and served on Lincoln's presidential commission that made successful arrangements for Union and Confederate troop prisoner exchanges. Fish returned to his law practice, after the Civil War, and was thought to have been retired from political life. When Ulysses S. Grant was elected President in 1868, he appointed Fish as U.S. Secretary of State in 1869. Fish took on the State Department with vigor, reorganized the office, and established civil service reform. During his 8 year tenure, Fish had to contend with Cuban belligerency, the settlement of the Alabama claims, Canadian border disputes, and the Virginius Incident. Fish implemented a new concept of international arbitration, where disputes between countries were settled by negotiations, rather than military conflicts. Fish was involved in a political feud between Sen. Charles Sumner and President Grant's unsuccessful controversial attempt for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. Fish organized a naval expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to open trade with Korea in 1871. Leaving office and politics in 1877, Fish returned to private life and continued to serve on various historical associations. Fish's male descendants would later serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for three generations. Fish died of old age in his luxurious New York State home in 1893. Early life and career. Hamilton Fish was born on August 3, 1808 at what is now known as the Stuyvesant–Fish House in Greenwich Village, New York City, to Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a great-great-granddaughter of New Amsterdam's Peter Stuyvesant), and his parents named him after their friend Alexander Hamilton. Nicholas Fish (1758–1833) was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War. Col. Fish was active in the Yorktown Campaign that resulted in the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.  Fish graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1827 and was admitted to the New York bar in 1830, practicing briefly with William Beach Lawrence. At Columbia Fish became fluent in French, a language that would later help him as U.S. Secretary of State. He served as commissioner of deeds for the city and county of New York from 1832 through 1833, and was an unsuccessful Whig candidate for New York State Assembly in 1834. Marriage and family. On December 15, 1836 Hamilton Fish married Julia Kean (a descendant of a New Yorker who was a New Jersey governor, William Livingston). The couple's lengthy married life was described as happy and Mrs. Fish was known for her ""sagacity and judgement"". The couple would have three sons and five daughters. Hamilton Fish had multiple notable descendants and relatives. New York political career. U.S. Representative. For eight years after his defeat as a Representative in the New York State Assembly, Fish was reluctant to run for office. However, Whig party leaders in 1842 convinced him to run for the House of Representatives. In November, Fish was elected to the House of Representatives; having defeated Democrat John McKeon and serving in the 28th Congress from New York's 6th District between 1843 and 1845. The Whigs at this time were in the minority in the House, however, Fish gained valued national experience serving on the Committee of Military Affairs. After losing his bid for re-election, he returned to private practice as a lawyer. Lieutenant Governor. Fish was the Whig candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1846, but was defeated by Democrat Addison Gardiner who had been endorsed by the Anti-Rent Party. Leasing farmers in New York refused to pay rent to large land tract owners and sometimes resorted to violence and intimidation. Fish had opposed the use of illegal tactics not to pay rent. Gardiner was elected in May 1847 a judge of the New York Court of Appeals and vacated the office of lieutenant governor. Fish was then in November 1847 elected to fill the vacancy, and was Lieutenant Governor in 1848. Lieut. Gov. Fish had a favorable reputation for being ""conciliatory"" and for his ""firmness"" over the New York Senate. Governor. In November 1848, he was elected Governor of New York, defeating John A. Dix and Reuben H. Walworth, and served from January 1, 1849, to December 31, 1850. At 40 years of age, Fish was one of the youngest governors to be elected in New York history. Gov. Fish spoke out against the extension of slavery from land acquired from the Mexican American War. Gov. Fish advocated and signed into law free public education facilities throughout New York state. Gov. Fish advocated and signed into law the building of an asylum and school for the mentally retarded. In 1850, Gov. Fish recommended that the State legislature form a committee to collect and publish the Colonial Laws of New York. All the bills Gov. Fish vetoed were never overturned by the New York legislature. U.S. Senator. After Gov. Fish had retired from office he did not openly seek the nomination to be elected U.S. Senator. However, Fish's supporters, in January, 1851, nominated him as a candidate for U.S. Senator. Though Fish was a popular governor a deadlock ensued over his nomination. There had been misgivings by certain state Senators in the New York legislature over Fish's views on slavery. Before the election Fish had declined to speak specifically on compromise legislation over slavery, but had only stated government should enforce the laws. Although Fish did not favor the spread of slavery he was hesitant to support the free soil movement. Finally, when two Democratic Senators who were against Fish's nomination were conspicuously absent, the Senate took action and voted. On March 19, 1851, Fish was elected a U.S. Senator from New York and he took his seat on December 1, serving alongside future Secretary of State William H. Seward.  In the United States Senate, he was a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations until the end of his term on March 4, 1857. Fish became friends with President Franklin Pierce's Secretary of State William L. Marcy and Attorney General Caleb Cushing. He was a Republican for the latter part of his term and was part of a moderately anti-slavery faction. During the 1850s the Republican Party replaced the Whig Party as the central party against the Democratic Party. By 1856, Fish privately considered himself a Whig although he knew that the Whig Party was no longer viable politically. Fish was a quiet Senator, rather than an orator, who liked to keep to himself. Fish often was in disagreement with Senator Sumner, who was firmly opposed to slavery and advocated equality for blacks. His policy was to vote for legislation on the side of ""justice, economy, and public virtue."" He strongly opposed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Fish often voted with the Free Soil faction and was strongly against the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. In February 1855, merchants represented by Moses H. Grinnell, criticized Fish's bill on immigration and maritime commerce. Fish's bill was designed to protect Irish and German immigrants who were dying on merchant ships during oceanic passage to America. The merchants believed that Fish's bill was oppressive to commercial interests over human interests.  During his tenure, the nation and Congress were in tremendous political upheaval over slavery, that included violence, disorder, and disturbances of the peace. In 1856, pro slavery advocates invaded Kansas and used violent tactics against those who were anti-slavery. In May 1856, Senator Charles Sumner was viciously attacked by Preston Brooks in the Senate Chamber. At the expiration of his term, he traveled with his family to Europe and remained there until shortly before the opening of the American Civil War, when he returned to begin actively campaigning for the election of Abraham Lincoln. While in France, Fish studied foreign policy with diplomats and distinguished Americans; having gained valuable experience that would eventually benefit his tenure as Secretary of State. American Civil War. After Abraham Lincoln had been elected President in 1860, Fish spent time with Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, commander of the Federal Army. Fish's private secretary had aided the efforts of the ""Star of the West"", an American merchant ship sent by President James Buchanan to bring relief supplies to Major Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter. While Fish was dining with General Scott in New York a telegram was received that announced the Confederates had attacked the ""Star of the West"" in Charleston Bay. When Fish stated that this meant war, Scott replied ""Don't utter that word, my friend. You don't know what a horrid thing war is.""  In 1861 and 1862 Fish joined and participated on the ""Union Defense Committee of the State of New York"", that from April 22, 1861, to April 30, 1862 co-operated with the New York City government in the raising and equipping troops, and disbursed more than $1 million for the relief of New York volunteers and their families. The committee included chairman John A. Dix, William M. Evarts, William E. Dodge, A.T. Stewart, John Jacob Astor and other New York men. Fish was appointed chairman of the committee after Dix joined the Union Army. In 1862 Fish was appointed by President Lincoln on a commission to serve with Bishop Edward R. Ames to visit the Union Army prisoners being held in the Confederate States of America capital in Richmond, Virginia. The Confederate government, however, refused to allow the commission to enter the city. Instead, Fish and Rev. Ames were able to start a system of prisoner exchange that remained virtually unchanged throughout the American Civil War. After the War ended Fish went back to private practice as a lawyer in New York. U.S. Secretary of State. Hamilton Fish was appointed Secretary of State by President Ulysses S. Grant and served between March 17, 1869 and March 12, 1877. He was President Grant's longest-serving Cabinet officer. Upon assuming office in 1869, Fish was initially underrated by some statesmen including former Secretaries of State William H. Seward and John Bigelow. Fish, however, immediately took on the responsibilities of his office with diligence, zeal, and intelligence. Fish's tenor as Secretary of State was lengthly, almost eight years, and he had to contend with many foreign policy issues including the Cuban insurrection, the Alabama Claims, and the Franco-Prussian War.  Reformed U.S. State Department 1869. When Fish assumed office he immediately began a series of reforms in the Department of State. After appropriations were given to his office by Congress, Fish cataloged and organized 700 volumes of miscellaneous State Department documents and created the ""Bureau of Indexes and Archives"". Fish introduced indexing of State Department files so subordinates could easily find documents. Fish implemented Civil Service reform by having State Department applicants be required to pass an entry examination before being appointed consultant. This policy was sometimes hampered, since President Grant could appoint any person to office without the person having to take an examination. However, the policy of testing overall improved the staff at the State Department. Fish's methods of organization included disciplined staff and prompt copying of dispatches. The method of record keeping, however, was cumbersome, having remained the same since John Quincy Adams. Rather than world regions, countries were listed in alphabetical order; the correspondence was embedded in bound diplomatic and consular category archives, rather than by subject matter. Added to countries' information was a miscellaneous category filed chronologically. This resulted in a tedious and time consuming process to make briefings for Congress. Diplomatic ministers, only 23 in 1877, were not kept informed of current world events that took place in other parts of the world. Cuban belligerency and insurrection 1869-1870. By 1869, Cuban nationals were in open rebellion against their mother country Spain, due to the unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared to be on the verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency. Fish, who desired settlement over the Alabama Claims, did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since Queen Victoria and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861. Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain. In February 1870, Senator John Sherman authored a Senate resolution that would have recognized Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain. The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish, worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels. On June 13, 1870 the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by the President and Congress, after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency. President Grant continued the policy of Cuban belligerent non recognition for the rest of his two administrations. This policy, however, was tested in 1873 with the Virginius Affair. Dominican Republic annexation treaty 1869-1870. After President Grant assumed office on March 4, 1869 one of his immediate foreign policy interests was the annexation of the Caribbeann island nation of the Dominican Republic, at that time referred to as Santo Domingo, to the United States. President Grant believed the annexation of Santo Domingo would increase the United States' mineral resources and alleviate the effects of racism against African Americans in the South. Hamilton Fish, though loyal to President Grant, did not desire annexation; the divided island nation, run by African leader President Buenaventura Báez, had been troubled with civil strife. Báez had imprisoned an American citizen, Davis Hatch, for speaking out against the Báez government. Fish told Grant that the Senate would not be ready to pass a Santo Domingo annexation treaty. In April 1869 Fish gave Grant’s private secretary Orville Babcock “special agent” status to search the island. In September 1869, Babcock made a preliminary treaty that would annex Santo Domingo to the United States and give it the opportunity to apply for statehood. In October 1869, Fish drew up a formal treaty that included: a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt; Samaná Bay would be leased to the United States for $150,000 yearly payment; Santo Domingo would eventually be given statehood.  In a private conference with President Grant, Fish agreed to support the Santo Domingo annexation if President Grant sent Congress a non-belligerency statement not to get involved with the Cuban rebellion against Spain. Charles Sumner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was against the treaty, believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent, and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be dealt with in the continental United States. Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values. On January 10, 1870 Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the United States Senate. Fish believed Senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option. The Senate took its time deliberating, and finally rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870. Eighteen Senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty. Pres. Grant, angered at Sumner's refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner's friend J. Lothrop Motley, Grant's ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish's instructions regarding the Alabama Claims. Grant believed Sumner had in January 1870 stated support for the Santo Domingo treaty. Sumner was then deprived of his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1871 by Grant's allies in the Senate. Colombian inter-oceanic canal treaty 1870. President Grant and Secretary Fish were interested in establishing an inter-oceanic canal through Panama. Secretary Fish organized a treaty signing on January 26, 1870 in Bogota between the United States and Colombia that established a Panama route for the inter-oceanic canal. The Colombian Senate, however, amended the treaty so much that the strategic value of the inter-oceanic canal construction became ineffective. As a result, the United States Senate refused to ratify the treaty. Treaty of Washington 1871. During the previous administration under President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State Seward attempted to resolve the Alabama Claims with the Johnson-Clarendon convention and treaty. The Alabama Claims had arisen out of the American Civil War, when Confederate cruiser ships built in British ports had damaged Union shipping. The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, presented to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly defeated by the Senate and the claims remained unresolved. Anglophobia led by Charles Sumner was at an all-time high when Fish became Secretary of State. Sumner had demanded Britain cede Canada to the United States as payment for the Alabama Claims. In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William E. Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the door was open for renewed negotiations with Britain. On January 9, 1871, Fish met with British representative Sir John Rose in Washington and an agreement was made, under much negotiations, to establish a Joint Commission to settle the Alabama claims to be held in Washington under the direction of Hamilton Fish. At stake was the financing of America's debt with British bankers during the Civil War, and peace with Britain was required. On February 14, 1871 both distinguished High Commissioners representing Britain, led by the Earl of Ripon, George Robinson, and the United States, led by Fish, met in Washington D.C. and negotiations over settlement went remarkably well. Also representing Britain was Canadian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. After 37 meetings, on March 8, 1871 the Treaty of Washington was signed at the State Department and became a ""landmark of international conciliation"". The Senate ratified the treaty on May 24, 1871. On August 25, 1872, the settlement for the Alabama claims was made by an international arbitration committee meeting in Geneva and the United States was awarded $15,500,000 in gold for damaged done by the Confederate warships. Under the treaty settlement over disputed Atlantic fisheries and the San Juan Boundary (concerning the Oregon boundary line) was made. The treaty was considered an ""unprecedented accomplishment"", having solved border disputes, reciprocal trade, and navigation issues. A friendly perpetual relationship between Great Britain and America was established, with Britain having expressed regret over the Alabama damages. South American détente and armistice 1871. On April 11, 1871 a peace conference, presided by Hamilton Fish, was held in Washington D.C. between Spain and the South American republics of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, that resulted in an armistice between the countries. These countries had been in a ""technical"" state of war since 1866, and the United States in 1871 served as mediator, directed by Hamilton Fish. Representing Spain was Mauricio Lopez Roberts; Manuel Freyer represented both Peru and Bolivia; Joaquin Godoy represented Chile; and Antonio Flores represented Ecuador. President Grant gave Fish full powers to control negotiations at the détente meeting between the five countries. The signed armistice treaty consisted of seven articles; hostilities were to cease for a minimum of three years and the countries would allow commercial trade with neutral countries. Korean expedition and conflict 1871. In 1871, Korea was known as the ""Hermit Kingdom"", a country determined to remain isolated from other nations, specifically from commerce and trade from Western nations, including the United States. In 1866, U.S. relations with Korea were troubled when Christian missionaries were beheaded by the Korean ""tacwongun"", regent to King Kojong, and the crew of the ""General Sherman"", a U.S. trading ship, were massacred. Secretary William H. Seward, under President Andrew Johnson demanded redress for what was perceived as the outrageous actions of the Korean government. U.S. Naval warships were ordered to the Orient, however, when Seward's term ended in 1869, he was unable to organize a naval expedition. When Fish took office he organized the Korean naval expedition and broadened the purposes. In April, 1871 Fish ordered Frederick F. Low, minister to China, to take the Asiatic Fleet and voyage to Seoul. The purpose of the expedition was to seek retribution for the assaulted sailors and to open up a commercial treaty with the King of Korea. Fish had told the fleet not to use force unless the honor of the U.S. Flag was infringed by the Koreans.  On May 8, 1871 Low and Rear Admiral John Rodgers, commander of the Asiatic Squadron, voyaged to Korea with five warships, eighty-five guns, and 1,230 sailors and marines. On May 16, the naval squadron reached Nagasaki Bay and a week later lowered anchor near the mouth of the Han. The Koreans sent unofficial representatives to stall for time and hope the American Squadron would leave. In June, the American fleet while doing nautical survey was fired upon by the Korean Forts on the Han River leading to Seoul. The American fleet fired back damaging the forts. An apology was demanded, since the honor of the American flag had been violated. On June 10, a U.S. military expedition was launched, after the Koreans failed to apologize for the attack; the objective to destroy the Korean forts on Kanghoa Island. The U.S.S. Monocacy pounded the forts with 9 inch guns while 546 sailors and 105 marines landed on the island ; captured and destroyed the Korean forts. The ""Citadel"" fortress, on a steep 115 foot hillside, posed the most difficulty in taking for the American troops, fighting in hand to hand combat with the Korean Tiger Hunters. All of the Korean forts taken, were destroyed and leveled on June 11. 350 Korean Tiger Hunters were killed; versus only one officer and two American sailors. Lieut. Hugh W. McKee was the first U. S. Navy officer to die in battle in Korea. The Asiatic Squadron remained on the Han River for three weeks, however, the Koreans would not open negotiations for a commercial treaty. As the American Squadron left, the Koreans believed that they had won a great victory over the Americans. The attempt to open Korea up to trade was similar to how Admiral Matthew Perry in 1854 had opened up Japan to Western trade. Korea, however, proved to be more isolated then Japan. In 1881, Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt, without using a naval fleet, went to a more conciliatory Korean government and made a commercial treaty. The U.S. was the first Western nation to establish formal trade with Korea. Virginius affair 1873. During the 1870s Cuba was in a state of rebellion against Spain. In the United States, Americans were divided on whether to militarily aid the rebel Cubans. Many jingoists believed the United States needed to fight for the Cuban rebels and pressured the Grant Administration to take action. A privately owned ship, the Virginius, was used to run guns, ammunition, and vital supplies to the Cuban rebels. The captain of the Virginius was Joseph Fry, former officer of the Confederate and Federal Navies. On October 31, 1873 the Virginius was run down in neutral waters by the Spanish warship, the Tornado, off of Morant Bay, Jamaica. After being hit, the Virginius took on water and was forced to surrender to the Spanish authorities. The 103 crew members consisted of Cuban rebel recruits and 52 American and British citizens. The Spanish hauled down and trampled the American flag, and brought the prisoners to Santiago. A total of 53 Virginius crew members were executed by the Spanish authorities. The Spanish finally stopped the carnage as a British warship appeared with guns ready to fire on Santiago. The American Navy, at this time, although formidable world wide, was in decline after the American Civil War. When news reached the United States of the executions, President Grant and Secretary Fish were forced to make an immediate response. Many Americans demanded a full scale war with Spain. Fish found out that the registration was falsified under American ownership, however, the executions of Americans demanded action. Fish, coolly handled the situation, called upon Spanish minister, Admiral José Polo de Bernabé in Washington D.C. and held a conference. A settlement was made where Spain relinquished the severely damaged Virginius to the U.S. Navy, while survivors were released that included 13 Americans. The Spanish Captain who ordered the executions was censured, and Spain paid $80,000 reparations to American families whose family members were executed in Santiago. The national honor of both Spain and the United States was preserved and it was chiefly due to the restraint and moderation of Fish and Bernabé that a satisfactory settlement of the Virginius Affair was reached by the United States and Spain. Hawaiian reciprocal trade treaty 1875. Fish also negotiated the reciprocity treaty of 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii. Hawaiian sugar was made duty free; while the importation of manufactured goods and clothing was allowed into the island kingdom. By opening Hawaii to free trade the process for eventual statehood into the United States had begun. Liberian-Grebo war 1876. The U.S. settled the Liberian-Grebo war in 1876 when Hamilton Fish dispatched the USS ""Alaska"", under President Grant's authority, to Liberia. Liberia was in practice an American colony. U.S. envoy James Milton Turner, the first African American ambassador, requested a warship to protect American property in Liberia. Turner, bolstered by U.S. naval presence in harbor and support of the USS ""Alaska"" captain, negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia. Republican convention 1876. As the 1876 Republican convention approached during the U.S. Presidential Election, President Grant, unknown to Fish, had written a letter to Republican leaders to nominate Fish for the Presidential ticket. The letter was never read at the convention and Fish was never nominated. President Grant believed that Fish was a good compromise choice between the rival factions of James G. Blaine and Roscoe Conkling. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a caricature of Fish and Rutherford B. Hayes as the Republican Party ticket. Fish, who was ready to retire to private life, did not desire to run for President and was content at returning to private life. Fish found out later President Grant had written the letter to the convention. Nicaragura inter-oceanic canal negotiations 1877. President Grant at the close of his second term, and Secretary Fish, remained interested in establishing an inter-oceanic canal treaty. Fish and the State Department negotiated with a special envoy from Nicaragua in February, 1877 for an inter-oceanic treaty. Negotiations, however, failed as the status of the neutral zone could not be established. Later life, death. After leaving the Grant Cabinet in 1877 and briefly serving under President Hayes, Fish returned to private life, practicing law and managing his real estate in New York City. Fish was revered in the New York community and enjoyed spending time with his family. Fish resided in Glen Clyffe, his estate near Garrison, New York, in Putnam County, New York, in the Hudson River Valley. His health remained good until around 1884, having suffered from neuralgia. On September 6, 1893 Fish had retired from the evening having played cards with his daughter. The following morning on September 7, Fish, at the age of 84, suddenly died. His death was attributed to old age.  On September 11, 1893 Fish was buried in Garrison at St. Philip's Church-in-the-Highlands Cemetery under waving trees along on the hills by the Hudson River shoreline. He was buried next to his wife and oldest daughter. Fish was buried near the grave of Edwards Pierrepont, President Grant's U.S. Attorney General. Many notable persons attended Fish's funeral, while Bishop Potter conducted services. Julia Grant, widowed wife of Ulysses S. Grant, attended Fish's funeral. Charles Francis Adams describe Fish as ""a quiet and easy-going man; but, when aroused, by being, as he thought, 'put upon', he became very formidable. Neither was it possible to placate him."" Fish's 20th Century biographer, A. Elwood Corning, stated that Fish was free from ""petty jealousies and prejudices which so often drag the reputation of statesmen down to the level of politicians"" and that Fish ""used the language and practiced the manners of a gentleman."" As an invaluable member of the Grant Administration, Fish commanded ""men's confidence, and respect by his firmness, candor, and justice."" Notable descendants. Three of Fish's direct descendants, all named Hamilton, served in the U.S. House of Representatives for the state of New York. Hamilton Fish II, Fish's son, served one term as U.S. Representative from 1909 to 1911. Fish II also served as assistant to Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. Hamilton Fish III, Fish's grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1920 to 1945. Hamilton Fish IV, Fish's great-grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1969 to 1995. Another son Stuyvesant Fish was an important railroad executive. Another son, Nicholas Fish II, was a U.S. diplomat, who was appointed second secretary of legation at Berlin in 1871, became secretary in 1874, and was chargé d'affaires at Berne in 1877–1881, and minister to Belgium in 1882–1886, after which he engaged in banking in New York City. Hamilton Fish, Fish's grandson by Nicholas, was an 1895 graduate of Columbia College of Columbia University, saw service in the Spanish-American War as one of the storied Rough Riders. He was the first member of that regiment to be killed in action, at the Battle of Las Guasimas, Cuba. "

wikipedia-383936," Venezuelan bolívar  The bolívar fuerte (sign: Bs.F. or Bs.; plural: ""bolívares fuertes;"" ISO 4217 code: VEF) is the currency of Venezuela since 1 January 2008. It is subdivided into 100 céntimos and replaced the ""bolívar"" (sign: Bs.; plural: ""bolívares""; ISO 4217 code: VEB) at the rate of Bs.F. 1 = Bs. 1,000 because of inflation. History. Bolívar. The bolívar was adopted by the monetary law of 1879, replacing the short-lived venezolano at a rate of five bolívares to one venezolano. Initially, the bolívar was defined on the silver standard, equal to 4.5g fine silver, following the principles of the Latin Monetary Union. The monetary law of 1887 made the gold bolívar unlimited legal tender, and the gold standard came into full operation in 1910. Venezuela went off gold in 1930, and in 1934 the bolívar exchange rate was fixed in terms of the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.914 bolívares = 1 U.S. dollar, revalued to 3.18 bolívares = 1 U.S. dollar in 1937, a rate which lasted until 1941. Until 18 February 1983 (now called Black Friday (""Viernes Negro"") by many Venezuelans), the bolívar had been the region's most stable and internationally accepted currency. It then fell prey to high devaluation. Exchange controls were adopted since February 5, 2003 to limit capital flight, pegged to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate of 1600 VEB to the dollar. Bolívar fuerte. The government announced on 7 March 2007 that the bolívar would be revalued at a ratio of 1 to 1000 on 1 January 2008 and renamed the ""bolívar fuerte"" in an effort to facilitate the ease of transaction and accounting. The new name is literally translated as ""strong bolívar"", but also references an old coin called the ""Peso fuerte"" worth 10 Spanish reales. The name ""bolívar fuerte"" is only used temporarily to distinguish it from the older currency that is being used along with the bolívar fuerte. The Central Bank of Venezuela is promoting the new currency with an ad campaign and the slogan: """"Una economía fuerte, un bolívar fuerte, un país fuerte"""" (lit. ""a strong economy, a strong bolívar, a strong country""). Nevertheless, the black market value of the ""bolívar fuerte"" has been significantly lower than the fixed exchange rate of 2.15 (in February 2008 it was as high as 7.0 to 1). It is illegal to publish this ""parallel exchange rate"" in Venezuela. Some estimations suggest that the government spent more than US$320 million to introduce the new currency. On 8 January 2010, the value was changed by the government from the fixed exchange rate of 2.15 bolívares fuertes to 2.60 bolívares for some imports (certain foods and healthcare goods) and 4.30 bolívares for other imports like cars, petrochemicals, and electronics. On 4 January 2011, the fixed exchange rate became 4.30 bolívares for 1.00 USD for both sides of the economy. It should be noted that the official exchange rate is restricted to individuals by CADIVI, which imposes an annual limit on the amount available for travel (up to $3000 annually depending on the location and duration of travel) and $400 for electronic purchases. Since Hugo Chavez imposed strict currency controls in 2003, there have been a series of five currency devaluations, disrupting the economy. There was another devaluation on 13 February 2013 (to 6.30 bolivars per dollar), in an attempt to counter budget deficits. Coins. Bolívar. In 1879, silver coins were introduced in denominations of , ½, 1, 2, and 5 bolívares, together with gold 20 bolívares. Gold 100 bolívares were also issued between 1886 and 1889. In 1894, silver ¼ bolívar coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 5 and 12½ céntimos in 1896. In 1912, production of gold coins ceased, whilst production of the 5 bolívares ended in 1936. In 1965, nickel replaced silver in the 25 and 50 céntimos, with the same happening to the 1 and 2 bolívares in 1967. In 1971, cupro-nickel 10 céntimo coins were issued, the 12½ céntimos having last been issued in 1958. A nickel 5 bolívares was introduced in 1973. Clad steel (first copper, then nickel and cupro-nickel) was used for the 5 céntimos from 1974. Nickel clad steel was introduced for all denominations from 25 céntimos up to 5 bolívares in 1989. In 1998, after a period of high inflation, a new coinage was introduced consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 bolívar denominations. The former coins were: All the coins had the same design. On the obverse the left profile of the ""Libertador"" Simón Bolívar is depicted, along with the inscription """"Bolívar Libertador"""" within a heptagon, symbolizing the seven stars of the flag. On the reverse the coat of arms is depicted, circled by the official name of the country, with the date and the denomination below. In 2001, the reverse design was changed, putting the denomination of the coin at the right of the shield of the coat of arms, Semi-Circled by the official name of the country and the year of its emission below. Bolívar fuerte. Coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 12½, 25, 50 céntimos, and 1 bolívar. However, the coin of 1 céntimo is not widely used as most prices are rounded up to the next 5 céntimos. It will be noticed that there is a coin of 12½ céntimos and a coin of 1 céntimo; but no coin of ½ céntimo. It is therefore inconvenient to give correct change for a purchase of (for example) 53½ céntimos; this is however a largely academic ""problem"" as goods are priced (if they use the ½ at all) in 12½ céntimos increments. This nevertheless still presents theoretical mathematical problems, as there is also no 2½ céntimos coin.  Banknotes. Bolívar. In TACO 1940, the Banco Central de Venezuela began issuing paper money, introducing by 1945 denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 bolívares. 5 bolívar notes were issued between 1966 and 1974, when they were replaced by coins. In 1989, notes for 1, 2 and 5 bolívares were issued. As inflation took hold, higher denominations of banknotes started being introduced: 1,000 bolívares in 1991, 2,000 and 5,000 bolívares in 1994, and 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 bolívares in 1998. The first 20,000 banknotes were made in a green color similar to the one of the 2,000 banknotes, which caused confusion, and new banknotes were made in the new olive green color. The following is a list of a former Venezuelan bolívar banknotes. Bolívar fuerte. Banknotes are in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 bolívares.

wikipedia-383947," Fokker F27 Friendship  The Fokker F27 Friendship is a turboprop airliner designed and built by the defunct Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. Design and development. Design of the Fokker F27 started in the 1950s as a replacement to the successful Douglas DC-3 airliner. The manufacturer evaluated a number of different configurations before finally deciding on a high-wing twin Rolls-Royce Dart engine layout with a pressurised cabin for 28 passengers. The first prototype, registered PH-NIV, first flew on 24 November 1955. The second prototype and initial production machines were 0.9 m (3 ft) longer, addressing the first aircraft's slightly tail-heavy handling and also providing space for four more passengers, bringing the total to 32. These aircraft also used the more powerful Dart Mk 528 engine. Production. The first production model, the F27-100, was delivered to Aer Lingus in November 1958. Other early Friendship customers included Braathens SAFE, Luxair, Ansett, New Zealand National Airways Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines and Turkish Airlines.  In 1956, Fokker signed a licensing deal with the US aircraft manufacturer Fairchild for the latter to construct the F27 in the USA. The first U.S.-built aircraft flew on April 12, 1958. Fairchild also independently developed a stretched version, called the FH-227. Most sales by Fairchild were made in the North American market. Basic price for an RDa.6 powered F-27 in 1960 was £239,000. At the end of the Fokker F27’s production in 1987, 586 units had been built (plus another 207 F-27s and FH-227s in the USA by Fairchild), more than any other western European civil turboprop airliner at the time.  Many aircraft have been modified from passenger service to cargo or express-package freighter roles and remain in service in 2009. The last major cargo user of the F27 in the United States was FedEx Express, as cargo ""feeder"" aircraft. These were retired and replaced by ATR42 and ATR72 aircraft by the end of 2009, with the last of the aircraft being donated to Hickory Aviation Museum. The United States Army Parachute Team continues to use a C-31A Troopship for its diving exhibitions in 2011. In the early 1980s, Fokker developed a successor to the Friendship, the Fokker 50. Although based on the F27-500 airframe, the Fokker 50 is virtually a new aircraft with Pratt & Whitney Canada engines and modern systems. Its general performance and passenger comfort were improved over the F27. "
wikipedia-383950," Female submission  Female submission describes a relationship in which a female submits to usually the dominance of a man. The submission can be voluntary and consensual or may be obtained as a result of rape or duress. The dominant partner is usually a man, but could also be another woman, or more than one person. The term ""female submission"" most commonly refers to a woman who derives sexual pleasure from the act of submission to men, the pleasure arising passively, incidentally, as a side-effect of the practice of submission to a man.  Submission can take the form of passivity or obedience in relation to any aspect of conduct and behaviour. Submission can be to a partner in an interpersonal relationship, such as allowing the sex partner to initiate all sexual activity as well as setting the time and place and sex position. It can also be in relation to the type of sexual activity that the partners will engage in, including non-conventional sex such as anal sex, or BDSM or sexual roleplay. Some sex positions, such as doggy style, require a woman to be passive while an active sex partner performs sex acts on her, and this may be seen as a form of submission. Obedience may be a part of a sexual roleplay or activity, and can also be in the relation to the style of dress, if any, or behavior or any other manner. In fact, any act that is performed on a passive woman, such as undressing her, may be regarded as submissive behaviour on the part of the woman. A 1985 study suggests that about 30% of participants in BDSM activities are females. A 1995 study indicates that 89% of heterosexual females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for a submissive-recipient role in sexual bondage, suggesting also a preference for a dominant male, and 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role. Submission may be manifested in a multitude of ways whereby a woman relinquishes sexual or personal control to another, such as acts of servitude, submission to humiliation or punishment such as erotic spanking, or other activities, at times in association with bondage. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one time to another. Some women choose to include occasional sexual submission in an otherwise conventional sex life. For example, a woman may adopt a submissive role during a sexual activity to overcome a sexual inhibition she may have. A woman may choose to submit full-time, becoming a lifestyle slave. Some people derive erotic pleasure from the submissiveness of a sex partner, which they may regard as a turn-on; and some people regard obvious passivity as a form of feminine flirting or seduction. Some women sexually submit to the sexual wishes of their partner for the pleasure of the partner, which may itself result in sexual pleasure for the submissive woman. Some feminist writers argue that female sexual submission can amount to sexual objectification. When female subservience occurs as a consequence of a social system in which males, either as fathers or husbands, hold legal or ""de facto"" authority and power over related women, children, and household property, the arrangement is generally known as patriarchy and has historically been the norm in many (but not all) human cultures.

wikipedia-383952," Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais  Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Federal University of Minas Gerais or UFMG) is a federal university located in Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The students are admitted through yearly exams called vestibular. UFMG is one of Brazil's five largest universities, being the largest federal university. It offers 75 undergraduate degrees, including a Medicine degree, Law and Economics, plus Engineering and Science and Art degrees. It offers 57 PhD programs, 66 MSc programs, 79 Post-Baccalaureate programs and 38 medical internship programs. UFMG has a population of 49,254 students.  Its undergraduate courses were ranked in 1st place in the 2007 results for the National Student's Performance Exam (ENADE) and 4th place in the 2008 results. Its Computer Science course was considered the best in the country, as well the Social Sciences course, from FAFICH. by the latest edition of ENADE. The rector of UFMG is Prof. Clélio Campolina Diniz. Past students include former Brazilian presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and Tancredo Neves; writer, medical doctor and diplomat João Guimarães Rosa, writers Fernando Sabino, Pedro Nava and Cyro dos Anjos; plastic surgeon Ivo Pitanguy, poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade and musicians Samuel Rosa of Skank and Fernanda Takai of Pato Fu. UFMG is the tenth in the rankings of best universities in Latin America, according QS World University Rankings (2011/12). Location. UFMG campus is located in the northern part of Belo Horizonte, in the neighborhood of Pampulha. The campus area totals 8,775,579 square meters, while built area reaches 620,735 square meters. This is divided in three main campuses - Pampulha Campus, Health Sciences Campus in Central Belo Horizonte and Rural Sciences Institute in Montes Claros, together with a few buildings in other parts of Belo Horizonte, such as the School of Architecture.  Inside the Pampulha Campus there is the CDTN, a Federal Institute for Nuclear Sciences Research; it includes 38 buildings, dozens of scientific research laboratories and a 250 kW TRIGA nuclear reactor from General Atomics. There is also an extensive area of secondary forest known as the Estação Ecológica (""Ecological Station""), where some university scientists - mainly ecologists and zoologists - carry out research; this is the largest ""green"" area within the city boundaries, and is home to endemic insect species.  In the academic years of 2007 and 2009, the Ministry of Education ranked UFMG as the best university in Brazil. History. The origins of the university go back to the 19th century, when it first appeared in the Republic as a continuation of a process that began during the Empire, with the opening of the first institutions of higher education. In 1898, the Ouro Preto Faculty of Law was transferred to Belo Horizonte, which at the time was set to be the new state capital. A few new unconnected faculties would be founded later: in 1907, the Free School of Dentistry; in 1911, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Engineering, and a course in pharmacy attached to the Free School of Dentistry. A group of patriots, the ""Inconfidentes,"" who rebelled against Portuguese domination, conceived of the idea of a university in the state of Minas Gerais, which was founded as the Universidade de Minas Gerais (UMG) in 1927. The state-subsidized private institution brought together the four institutions of higher learning that existed in Belo Horizonte. UMG remained within the state system until 1949, when it was federalized.  In 1927, these four schools merged to found UMG, University of Minas Gerais, a private institution subsidized by the state government. The UMG remained funded by Minas Gerais government until 1949, when funding had been delegated to Brazilian Government. Even though, the name UFMG was not adopted until 1965. In the 1940s, a large area in the Pampulha region became the site for the construction of University City. The first structures erected were the Institute of Mechanics (now the Vocational School) and the Main Building. The effective occupation of the campus by the university community started only in the 1960s, when the construction of the buildings that today house most of the academic units was started. At the time of federalization, the schools of architecture, philosophy and economics were already integrated in the university. As its expansion carried on, the School of Nursing (1950), Veterinary Science (1961), Information Science (1962), Music (1962) and Physical Education (1969) were founded. In 1968, a university reform altered profoundly the structure of UFMG. The College of Philosophy spawned multiple institutions: the College of Philosophy and Human Sciences, the Institute of Biological Sciences, the Institute of Exact Sciences, the Institute of Geosciences and the Colleges of Literature and Education. Additional courses have been established, among them agronomy, archival science, theater, museology, control and automation engineering, computational mathematics, and speech therapy/audiology. Research. The Office of the Dean of Research advises the university administration on scientific and technological research, as well as encouraging research. The Center for Technology Innovation and Transfer promotes activities that apply technology development and transfer knowledge between UFMG and the community, via the creation of partnerships between researchers and business. Applied Social Sciences. Information Science. The School of Information Science (former School of Librarian Science) has a full-time academic staff that explores research topics in the areas of Scientific and Technological, Managerial, and Social and Historical Information. In addition, using the Lab of Information Treatment, the unit works on topics related to information storage and diffusion. Law. The Law School of UFMG has four main departments, which are devoted to the following areas: General Theory of Law (Jurisprudence), Legal History, Private Law and Civil Procedural Law, Criminal Law and Criminal Procedural Law, International Law, Conflict of Laws, Public Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, Economic Law, Tax Law, Labour Law amongst others. On 20th December 2012, the School of Law will celebrate its 120th anniversary, being one of the oldest Law Schools in Brazil after University of São Paulo (USP) and Universities of Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro.  Between 1892 - year of its foundation - and 1927 the Law School was an autonomous institution and congregated several important lawyers and politicians in national context. In the year of 1927, the Free Law Faculty of Minas Gerais (Faculdade Livre de Direito de Minas Gerais) joined the administrative framework of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Since then, it is one of UFMG's main Schools and Research Centres. Architecture. One of the research centers at the School of Architecture, which is divided into four departments, is the Graphic Laboratory for the Teaching of Architecture (Lagear), equipped with computer-assisted design programs. Among the research topics are Computer-Assisted Photogrametry, Computer-Assisted Photo-Documentation, Photorealistic Representations, as well as studies on accessibility (Architecture without barriers for disabled people). Economics. Most research topics explored at the School of Economics (Face) are related to work done at the Center for Regional Development and Planning (Cedeplar), at the Center for Research and Graduate Studies in Business Administration (Cepead), and at the Research Institute in Economics, Business Administration, and Accounting (Ipead). At Cedeplar, where 25 teachers have a doctoral degree and 10 have a master’s degree, there is research on Demographics and on Economics, with projects on Fecundity, Historical Demographics and Labor, Agricultural and Industrial Economics, Economic History, Economics and Environment, and Privatizations. At Cepead, 11 teachers have a doctoral degree and eight have a master’s. They study Sectors of Support for Decision Making, Human Behavior in Organizations, Performance and Financial Strategy in Organizations. With four teachers holding a doctoral degree and two holding a master’s, the Ipead provides consultancy and calculates monthly rates of indices, such as price and rent variation. Biological Sciences. Six graduate programs and around 300 topics of research occupy 290 teachers at the Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB), 90% of whom holding doctoral, master’s or post-baccalaureate degrees. The laboratories of the institute’s ten departments conduct research in Biology, some of them being national standards, such as the Center of Electronic Microscopy. ICB has developed a simple non-radioactive methodology for the study of DNA impressions and the American visceral leishmaniasis vaccine. Among the ICB topics of research responsible for the largest number of publications are those related to the development of new vaccines and medications – Biochemistry, Immunology, and Microbiology – to Genetics and to Ecology. The unit makes contributions to Botany, Zoology, Morphology, and Parasitology. To assist researchers and teachers, ICB has four laboratory animal facilities with hundreds of guinea pigs kept in accordance to international principles of animal experimentation. College of Veterinary Medicine. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3x2gHU_xqw&feature=player_embedded http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyiXXKwEHM Founded in 1932, the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) (Veterinary_College_of_UFMG) completed 80 years in 2012, and has trained over 5,000 veterinarians. CVM conducts animal science and veterinary medicine education and research. In addition to Veterinary Medicine, CVM offers an undergraduate degree in Aquaculture. MSc and PhD degrees in Animal Science and Animal Husbandry, Veterinary Medical Residency, and Professional MSc are available in 19 areas of knowledge. The college is located in the Pampulha Campus and has four departments: Veterinary Clinic and Surgery (DCCV), Preventive Veterinary Medicine (DMVP), Technology and Inspection of Animal Products (DTIPOA) and Animal Science (DZOO). Two experimental farms and the Veterinary Hospital are available.  The five-year Veterinary Medicine course takes 120 students per year and over 95% of undergraduate students complete the course. Most faculty at teaching are full-time, permanent and have PhD degrees (more than 90%). About 1/3 of undergraduate students participate in research activities in 112 laboratories and produce around 250 academic research abstracts per year. More than 140 scientific papers are produced per year by faculty members. Engineering. Around 70% of the 280 teachers at the School of Engineering work on 60 topics of research.  Most research work done in Engineering is related to technological development, with application in industry, funded by national and international agencies. By means of agreements and service contracts signed through the Christiano Otonni Foundation, the school makes contact with companies from the public and private sectors. In Sanitary and Environmental Engineering, an Environmental Monitoring and Water Treatment Project has been run in collaboration with the German agency TGZ. Three topics of research are pursued in Electric Engineering, monitored by the department’s Research Center: High Tension, which includes studies on protection against atmospheric discharges, Power Electronics, and Control of Industrial Processes. In the Department of Civil Engineering, research is carried out at the Laboratory of Structural Analysis, where structures submitted to very high pressure are evaluated. Work is being done on Energy Alternatives, mainly on Photovoltaic Energy (the transformation of sun light into energy) and Solar Collectors. The projects are supported by the Minas Gerais Energy Company (Cemig) and Eletrobrás. At the Department of Chemical Engineering, there is research on Liquid/Liquid Separation and on Heat Sensitive Substances. At the Department of Mining Engineering, two of the most important research topics are Mineral Treatment and Prospecting. The School of Engineering’s largest department is Metallurgic Engineering, which has an X-Ray Lab and an Electronic Microscopy Lab, among others. Research involves Extractive Metallurgy, Physical Metallurgy, which deals with material molding, and “Trefilação”.  Still at the School of Engineering, there is the Center for Electronic Computation, linked to the Scientific Computation Lab. Human Sciences. Fafich. Six academic units conduct research in Human Sciences and Applied Social Sciences. At the School of Philosophy and Human Science (Fafich), 90% of its near 220 teachers from the six departments have master’s or doctoral degrees and are doing research. At the Department of Sociology, researches focus mainly on Urban and Industrial Sociology and Sociology of Culture. At the Department of History, the characteristic topics are Oral, Political, and Economic History. The Department of Political Sciences works mostly with Public and Administrative Policies, Brazilian and International Politics, and Political Theory. At the Department of Philosophy, most works focus on the relationship between Philosophy and Psychoanalysis, Marxism, Social and Political Philosophy, Esthetics, Art Philosophy, and Logic. Also connected to Fafich, the Esthetics Laboratory does research and documentation work on Esthetics and Art and Civilization History. Education. The School of Education (FAE) has three departments, which carry out interdisciplinary activities with other university sectors. The Center for Literacy, Reading, and Writing (Ceale), which develops projects on child and adult literacy, has been the major source of publication at FAE. The Center for Mathematics and Science Teaching in Minas Gerais (Cecimig) studies the learning processes in the area and offers permanent courses for primary and secondary teachers. Health Sciences. Medicine. The UFMG School of Medicine’s ten departments research more than 100 topics, using the infrastructure of the Hospital das Clínicas and its 14 labs. Around 60% of the unit’s more than 470 teachers hold a master’s or a doctoral degree, and most of them take part in scientific production. A large part of the research stems from the 12 Medicine graduate programs offered by UFMG. Among the topics are Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Hematology and Oncology, Gastroenterology and Digestive Tract Surgery, Ophthalmology, and Endocrinology. There also publications on Pathology, Surgery, Ambulatory Surgery, Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Spider and Snake Poisons, Transplants, Toxicology, Tropical Medicine, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, AIDS, Fetal Medicine, Oncology, Gynecology and Obstetrics, and Preventive and Social Medicine. Nursing. More than half the 82 teachers of the School of Nursing, most of whom have master’s and doctoral degrees, are involved in projects that are largely interdisciplinary.  Distributed among the unit’s three departments, they work at the university hospitals and in the public health system. Some of their research topics are Education and the Nursing Curriculum, Transmitted Diseases, Work Force, Workers’ Health Quality, and Rites of Death in Senior Citizens’ Memories. Dentistry. Many of the School of Dentistry’s 100 teachers, one-fifth of whom hold a master’s or doctoral degree, does research. Research includes Bio-Safety in Dental Practice, Dental Trauma, Social Representation of Health and Mouth Disease, Orthodontics for Deciduous and Permanent Teeth, Surgery, Peridental Disease and Cyst, and Prevention and Epidemiology of Cavities and other Diseases. Pharmacy. The School of Pharmacy, which has four departments, does mostly experimental research. Of the unit’s more than 70 teachers, about 35% hold a doctoral degree and approximately the same percentage have a master’s degree. Research includes the development of new substances and medicines at the school’s laboratories, mainly the Labs of Medicines and of Pharmacognosis and Plant Chemistry. The Department of Food does research on Biotechnology (quality control and food science and technology). The Department of Clinical Analyses has work on Parasitology and Applied Toxicology, as well as on Clinical Bio-Chemistry. Physical Education. The School of Physical Education investigates about 20 research topics. At the two departments linked to the Physical Education program, nearly half the 35 teachers do research, most of which is done in the Labs of Exercise Physiology and of Sport Psychology. Research includes studies of the behavior of the human organism, athlete conditioning, prevention of temperature accidents during exercises, effects of caffeine on the body, and neuroendocrinologic response to exercise. In the Department of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, there are projects related to Neuropediatrics and to Physiotherapy in Geriatrics.

wikipedia-383962," Sac spider  The sac spiders of the family Clubionidae have a very confusing taxonomic history. Once this family was a large catch-all taxon for a disparate collection of spiders, similar only in that they had eight eyes arranged in two rows, conical anterior spinnerets that touched and were wandering predators that built silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark or under rocks. These are now recognized to include several families, some of which are more closely related to the three-clawed spiders, like lynx and wolf spiders, than to true ""clubionoids."" Genera. Among the families formerly classified as sac spiders, some of which have common names including the words ""sac spider"", include: as well as the remnant Clubionidae (now consisting of a little over 500 species in 15 genera worldwide). However ""sac spider"" used on its own should imply a member of the family Clubionidae. In North America the family as it is now recognised consists of only two genera, ""Clubiona"" and ""Elaver"" (formerly ""Clubionoides""). ""Clubiona"" is nearly worldwide in distribution. "
wikipedia-383963," Elisa Maza  Elisa Maza, voiced by Salli Richardson, is a fictional character and the human protagonist of the Disney animated television series ""Gargoyles"". In the series, she is a NYPD detective who is the steadfast ally (and honorary member) of the titular gargoyles' Manhattan Clan.  Elisa has an especially close relationship with the gargoyle Goliath, the clan's leader (a subject originally evaded by both of them and left deliberately ambiguous for over two seasons). She also serves as the clan's guide to the modern world as well as its voice of reason, often curbing the irrational impulses of its members. Character design. The character of a strong, female human lead was a part of the ""Gargoyles"" universe's conception since the development of Goliath as the gargoyle protagonist. Much as Xanatos began as a descendant or reincarnation of the prototypical Avalon Clan, Magus or Archmage character, Elisa was originally conceived as the reincarnation of the character that would later become Avalon Clan, Princess Katharine. This idea did not last, but the character endured as a potential love interest and equal for Goliath. Elisa had originally been designed as a Hispanic woman with the surname of Chavez. When Salli Richardson was cast as Elisa's voice actor, the character's race and ethnicity was adapted to match hers. Elisa became half-African American and half-Native American, which suited the show's allegory of human intolerance for gargoyles representing racial prejudice. Her last name was changed to Maza, which the creators believed to be a Sioux word for ""iron"", and which suited the character's strong will. The name Chavez was later used for Elisa's police captain. Fictional biography and characteristics. A Detective Second Grade in the NYPD 23 precinct, Elisa first encountered the gargoyles when investigating a series of disturbances in the castle atop the skyscraper of billionaire David Xanatos. The sudden appearance of Goliath while she was snooping around shocked her into falling over the battlements, and he swooped down to rescue her. The two developed a bond almost immediately, at first connecting by their shared duty to ""protect and serve"", and an attraction grew over time. This soon made Elisa the avowed enemy of Goliath's ex-mate, Demona, who first ""met"" Elisa when the latter thwarted Demona's attempt on Goliath's life. Elisa largely dubbed herself the protector of the protectors, although on a number of occasions she did display a certain unwillingness to share her secret (the existence of gargoyles) with anyone else, even her friends and family. She convinced the clan to leave the home of David Xanatos and move into the clock tower above the police station where she works. She then did everything she could to make them feel at home, bringing them food and even supplying a television set and old recliner chair. It was in part due to Elisa's role as a police detective that the Manhattan Clan realized what their new role was in the world, as they then dedicated themselves to defending the citizens of Manhattan. Elisa is most closely associated with Goliath. Her relationship with the noble gargoyle, despite their different species, was the series' backbone, and Hudson noticed it building as early as in the episode ""Awakening: Part 3"". Despite this, the relationship was never rushed: for much of the series, only Demona, Goliath's estranged and genocidal former lover, behaved as though aware of the unspoken tie between Elisa and Goliath. Demona's jealousy and hatred for humanity would lead her to fixate upon Elisa. A major turning point in the series was the episode ""The Mirror"". In this episode, a magic spell briefly transforms Elisa into a gargoyle. Elisa, who by this time has realized her own feelings for Goliath, sees this as the destruction of the only barrier preventing their relationship. For Goliath (himself briefly turned into a human later in the episode), the transformation is all he needs to finally understand that he also harbors romantic feelings for Elisa. He says at one point, ""I never realized before how beautiful you are."" However, after Elisa playfully counters about the prospect that she was ugly as a human, Goliath nervously changes the subject back to their flight lesson in progress. Though at the end of the episode, both give evidence of awareness of the other's feelings; but while Goliath tries to talk to Elisa, she cuts him off just before the sun rises stating, after he is changed into stone, ""...that's the way it is."" In the final arc of the show's second season, ""Hunter's Moon"", Elisa begins a relationship with her newly assigned partner on the police force, Jason Conover, little realizing that he is in fact Jason Canmore, a Hunter. Goliath's pain and jealousy when he learns this is palpable, but he forces himself not to act on it, and Elisa herself breaks the relationship off because ""There's someone... who comes first."" At the end of the episode, Elisa and Goliath finally admit their feelings to each other, and share their first kiss. In the comics, after breaking up with him because she wants children and insisting that he date Delilah, Elisa realizes that she loves Goliath and can't stand to lose him. As Goliath lies severely injured from one of Thailog's attacks, they both say that they love each other and kiss. Though Elisa is closest to Goliath, she has an effect on every gargoyle in the Manhattan Clan. It is Elisa that convinces Goliath's mentor to choose his own name Hudson, after the river —an act that is soon followed by the rest of the clan. Elisa is also supportive of Lexington's technological curiosity, providing many of the gizmos that he tinkered with. She even seemed to impress Brooklyn, who was slower than the others to forgive humans for the Wyvern Massacre. Besides Goliath, though, she seemed to make closest friends with Broadway. On several occasions, Broadway would arrive at Elisa's apartment unannounced. He showed an unparalleled interest in Elisa's police work, mostly because of detective movies that he had seen, joining her as her ""partner"" sometimes even without telling her first (such as in ""the Silver Falcon""). Despite this, he always managed to come through for her in the end. Broadway's relationship with Elisa was the focus of the episode ""Deadly Force"", which stresses the importance of gun safety: Broadway finds and plays with Elisa's gun, and he ends up accidentally shooting Elisa, nearly killing her. Broadway's guilt after this incident leads him to eschew all use of firearms (and Elisa is later shown taking far more precautions about her use of guns as well). Demona harbors, out of nearly the entire human race, the greatest resentment for Elisa, given her position in Goliath's (love) life; several of Demona's schemes include a plan for dealing specifically with Maza, either eliminating her outright or attempting to cause Goliath's trust in her to falter. Despite Demona's greater physical abilities and keen mind, Elisa has always stood up to the gargoyle, selflessly placing herself between her friends (the Manhattan clan) and the threat at hand. Finally, during the Avalon saga of the series, Elisa comes to meet and befriend Goliath's daughter, Angela, who is delighted to have a woman to converse with in the predominantly male clan. Elisa often functions as Angela's confidante, giving advice about various things and providing the same care and trust she gives to the rest of the clan. Elisa's upbringing in a multiracial household may have made her more open-minded when befriending the gargoyles, and particularly in her relationship with Goliath. Elisa is the eldest of three children born to Peter Maza, a retired NYPD sergeant of American Indian ethnicity, and his wife Diane, an African-American of Nigerian descent and an anthropologist specializing in the African culture. Elisa's siblings are her brother Derek (a.k.a. Talon) and her sister Beth. Elisa's family became more and more important as the series progressed, exploring each member's background in greater detail. Elisa and Derek both became police officers like their father, Derek somewhat ambivalently, whereas Beth followed more in her mother's footsteps, becoming an anthropologist, albeit specializing in her father's Native American heritage. Beth goes to university in Flagstaff, Arizona, while Diane would spend time in Nigeria and became a village griot in order to get in touch with her roots. Elisa's relationship with her brother became problematic when Derek was enticed to quit the police force and work for David Xanatos, stubbornly refusing to believe his sister's warnings about the industrialist's amoral ruthlessness. The incident of Derek paying the price of that naivetè, when he was manipulated by Xanatos through being mutated into a winged pantherine humanoid by the amoral geneticist Anton Sevarius, proved most troubling for Elisa (literally bringing her to tears) and her deepest grievance with the villain. By the conclusion of the episode ""The Cage"", however, Elisa and her family come to accept Derek's pantherine form as Talon, along with a beginnings of a romantic relationship with Maggie Reed, likewise given a similar winged felinoid form earlier by Sevarius. The relationship with her mother, Diane Maza, is a bit strained at first. This is easily seen in the beginning of the episode ""Mark of the Panther"", of the ""Avalon World Tour"" story arc. She is irritated by her mother's questions about her whereabouts during the Avalon World Tour and frustrated at Diane's inquiries of her well-being. At the end of the episode, Elisa learns to appreciate her mother more after realizing that Angela wishes for Goliath to show the same attitude Diane displays towards Elisa. After meeting with Goliath and talking to him about how to deal with Angela, Diane finally approves of his and the other gargoyles' presences in Elisa's life and comes to terms with the fact Elisa can live her own life. The episode ""Cloud Fathers"" explored Peter's background, and revealed that he and his father, Carlos Maza, had both taken part in a Kachina ritual in their youth. The ritual had specifically Hopi or possibly Zuni overtones (general consensus is that Peter's ancestors are largely, but not exclusively, Hopi). Interestingly enough, one of Oberon's children, Coyote, who is a revered figured in Native American mythology, took on the appearance of first a kachina dancer and then Peter in his youth in order to approach him. Likely this background may have made Peter more open to a relationship with Diane. This distinction helps tie Elisa even closer to her father: Peter's background and its influence on his choice of wife mirrors that affect that Elisa's own background had on her relationship with Goliath. Reception. In 2009, Elisa was ranked as sixth on the Retro Junk's list of top cartoon women of the 1990s. In 2011, she was included on UGO.com's list of ""the fifty imaginary women that really need to be brought to life by science somehow"", called ""one of the hottest female supporting characters in animation history.""

wikipedia-383969," Paradise Garage  The Paradise Garage was a discotheque notable in the history of modern dance and pop music, as well asLGBT and nightclub cultures It was founded by Michael Brody (its sole proprietor) and initially financed by music entrepreneur Mel Cheren. Paradise Garage was located at 84 King Street, in the Hudson Square neighborhood of New York City. It operated from 1976 to 1987 and was the base for DJ Larry Levan. The club's name derives from its origins as a parking garage. The Paradise Garage's business model was largely inspired by David Mancuso's parties at The Loft: no liquor was served, there were no sales of food or beverages, and the club was not open to the general public. The sound system was developed, designed, and installed by Richard Long of Richard Long & Associates (RLA), and was said by those who attended to be the best in New York City at that time. The club has been credited for its influence on the development of the modern dance club as it is today; unlike other clubs of its time, the Paradise Garage was focused on dancing rather than social interaction, and it was the first to put the DJ at the center of attention. It was known for its enthusiasm, though unforgiving nature if a performer was struggling. Musicians who have attended include Diana Ross and a young Madonna. Among those to benefit from what became known as ""The Garage Sound"" or ""Garage Music"" was Mel Cheren's own New York label West End Records. Among West End's successes were ""Sessomatto"" by Sessa Matto, ""Hot Shot"" by Karen Young, ""Heartbeat"" by Taana Gardner (remixed by Levan), ""Do it to the Music"" by Raw Silk, and ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by the Peech Boys (produced by Levan). West End Records folded for a number of years, re-opening in the late 90s and releasing one of Levan's DJ sets recorded live at the Garage.  The building which housed the Paradise Garage is now a facility for Verizon Communications. As of 2008, the Paradise Garage trademark is now owned by Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC).  Music. The unique and eclectic style of disco and dance music played at the Garage gave rise to the descriptive terms ""New York house"", ""garage"", ""garage style"", and ""garage classic"" (to describe a record that was made famous at or is associated with the Paradise Garage). When the term ""garage music"" is used in reference to the Paradise Garage, it does not exclusively mean house music, although certain house tracks may be considered to be garage classics.  House music as a genre originated with the Garage's house DJ Larry Levan and his contemporaries, Frankie Knuckles and Nicky Siano. These DJs played all kinds of music at the Paradise Garage so long as it was danceable - for example The Clash and The Police as well as traditional ""disco"" artists like Gwen Guthrie and Sylvester. Levan is remembered for his ability to seamlessly play music from different genres. The term ""garage"" has changed meaning over time, see UK garage for a more detailed description. This form of music is not related to garage rock. "

Professional biography. Moglen started out as a computer programming language designer and then received his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1980, where he won the Hicks Prize for Literary Criticism. In 1985, he received a Master of Philosophy in history and a JD from Yale University. He has held visiting appointments at Harvard University, Tel Aviv University and the University of Virginia since 1987. He was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall (1986–87 term). He joined the faculty of Columbia Law School in 1987, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1988. He received a Ph.D. in history from Yale University in 1993. Moglen serves as a director of the Public Patent Foundation. Moglen was part of Philip Zimmermann's defense team, when Zimmermann was being investigated over the export of Pretty Good Privacy, a public key encryption system, under US export laws.  In 2003 he received the EFF Pioneer Award. In February 2005, he founded the Software Freedom Law Center. Moglen is closely involved with the Free Software Foundation, serving as general counsel since 1994 and board member from 2000 to 2007. As counsel, Moglen was charged with enforcing the GNU General Public License (GPL) on behalf of the FSF, and later became heavily involved with drafting version 3 of the GPL. On April 23, 2007 he announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down from the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation. Moglen stated that after the GPLv3 Discussion Draft 3 had been released, he wanted to devote more time to writing, teaching, and the Software Freedom Law Center. Freedom Box Foundation. In February 2011, Moglen created the Freedom Box Foundation to design software for a very small server called the FreedomBox. The FreedomBox is an affordable personal server which runs only free software, with a focus on anonymous and secure communication. The foundation's purpose is to raise funds for the creation and expansion of software for the FreedomBox. Moglen hopes for upwards of $500,000 to be able to launch FreedomBox officially within a year. Stances on free software. Moglen says that free software is a fundamental requirement for a democratic and free society in which we are surrounded by and dependent upon technical devices. Only if controlling these devices is open to all via free software, can we balance power equally. ""Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law"" is the idea that the information appearance and flow between the human minds connected via the Internet works like induction. Hence Moglen's phrase ""Resist the resistance!"" (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information). Statements and perspectives. While speaking in New Delhi, India, in 2006, he remarked: ""Anything that is worth copying is worth sharing."" His other quotes: ""The more we give away, the richer we become."" And: ""Note how even the smallest encounter with Free Software can make a man cheerful about the future of our judge"" (said after hearing a judge of the Allahabad high court, India speak on the subject). Moglen believes the idea of proprietary software is as ludicrous as having ""proprietary mathematics"" or ""proprietary geometry"". This would convert the subjects from ""something you can learn"" into ""something you must buy"", he has argued. He points out that software is among the ""things which can be copied infinitely over and over again, without any further costs"". Moglen has criticized what he calls the ""reification of selfishness"". He has said, ""A world full of computers which you can't understand, can't fix and can't use (because it is controlled by inaccessible proprietary software) is a world controlled by machines."" He has called on lawyers to help the Free Software movement, saying: ""Those who want to share their code can make products and share their work without additional legal risks."" He urged his legal colleagues, ""It's worth giving up a little in order to produce a sounder ecology for all. Think kindly about the idea of sharing."" On the subject of Digital Rights Management, Moglen once said, ""We also live in a world in which the right to tinker is under some very substantial threat. This is said to be because movie and record companies must eat. I will concede that they must eat. Though, like me, they should eat less."" External links. more links can be found on wikisource "
wikipedia-383976," ABN AMRO  ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is a Dutch state-owned bank with headquarters in Amsterdam. It was re-established, in its current form in 2009, following the acquisition and break-up of the original ABN AMRO by a banking consortium consisting of Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Santander Group and Fortis. Following the collapse of Fortis, who acquired the Dutch business, it was nationalized by the Dutch government along with Fortis Bank Nederland. The bank is a product of a long history of mergers and acquisitions that date to 1765. In 1991, Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) and AMRO Bank (itself the result of a merger of the Amsterdamsche Bank and the Rotterdamsche Bank in the 1960s) agreed to merge to create the original ABN AMRO. By 2007, ABN AMRO was the second-largest bank in the Netherlands and the eighth-largest in Europe by assets. At that time the magazine ""The Banker"" and Fortune Global 500 placed it 15th in the list of world’s biggest banks and it had operations in 63 countries, with over 110,000 employees. In October 2007, a consortium of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander, known as RFS Holdings B.V. acquired the bank, in what was the world's biggest bank takeover to date. Consequently, the bank was divided into three parts, each owned by one of the members of the consortium. However, RBS and Fortis soon ran into serious trouble: the large debt created to fund the takeover had depleted the banks' reserves just as the financial crisis of 2007–2010 started. As a result, the Dutch government stepped-in and bailed out Fortis in October 2008, before splitting ABN AMRO's Dutch assets (which had primarily been allocated to Fortis) from those owned by RBS, which were effectively assumed by the UK government due to its bail-out of the British bank. The operations owned by Santander, notably those in Italy and Brazil, were merged with Santander, sold or eliminated. The Dutch government appointed former Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm as CEO to restructure and stabilise the bank, and in February 2010 the assets it owned were legally demerged from those owned by RBS. This demerger created two separate organisations, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. The former was merged with ABN AMRO Private Banking, Fortis Bank Nederland, the private bank MeesPierson (formerly owned by the original ABN AMRO and Fortis) and the diamond bank International Diamond & Jewelry Group to create ABN AMRO Group N.V., with the Fortis name being dropped on 1 July 2010. The remaining parts of the original ABN AMRO still owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., meanwhile, were renamed, sold or closed. The Dutch government has said that ABN AMRO would remain state-owned until at least 2014, after which it would consider a public stock market listing for the bank. History. Early years. In 1824, King William I established the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM) a trading company to revive trade and financing of the Dutch East Indies and it would become one of the primary ancestors of ABN AMRO. The NHM merged with the ""Twentsche Bank"" in 1964 to form Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN). In the same year, the ""Amsterdamsche Bank"", established in 1871, merged with the ""Rotterdamsche Bank"", established in 1873 (as part of merger that included ""Determeijer Weslingh & Zn."" from 1765), to form AMRO Bank. In 1991, ABN and AMRO Bank agreed to merge to create ABN AMRO. Through these mergers and acquisitions, ABN AMRO gained a large number of overseas companies and branches. From NHM, it owned a significant branch network in Asia and the Middle East. One of these, the Saudi Hollandi Bank was owned by the NHM Jeddah branch and in which ABN AMRO still had a 40% stake, caused questions in the Dutch parliament from the political Party for Freedom. Another, the Hollandsche Bank-Unie (HBU), which grew from the merger of the ""Hollandsche Bank voor de Middellandsche Zee"" (HBMZ) and the ""Hollandsche Zuid-Amerika Bank"" in 1933, gave ABN AMRO an extensive network of branches in South and Central America. In 1979, ABN expanded into North America with the acquisition of Chicago-based LaSalle National Bank. After the merger of ABN and AMRO Bank in 1991, the corporation continued to grow through a number of further acquisitions, including the 1996-purchase of suburban Detroit based Standard Federal Bank followed five-years later by the acquisition of its Detroit-based competitor Michigan National Bank which was rebranded as Standard Federal. In 2005, Standard Federal became ""LaSalle Bank Midwest"" to unite the two components. ABN AMRO purchased The Chicago Corporation, an American securities and commodities trading and clearing corporation in fall 1995. Other major acquisitions included the Brazilian bank Banco Real in 1998 and the Italian bank Antonveneta in 2006. It was also involved in the controversial acquisition of the Dutch local government mortgage and building development organisation, the Bouwfonds in 2000. ABN AMRO sold the Bouwfonds as a going concern in 2006. Reaching a cross roads. ABN AMRO had come to a crossroads in early 2005. The bank had still not come close to its own target of having a return on equity that would put it among the top-five of its peer group, a target that the CEO, Rijkman Groenink had set upon his appointment in 2000. From 2000 until 2005, ABN AMRO's stock price stagnated. Financial results in 2006 added to concerns about the bank's future. Operating expenses increased at a greater rate than operating revenue, and the efficiency ratio deteriorated further to 69.9%. Non-performing loans increased considerably year on year by 192%. Net profits were only boosted by sustained asset sales. There had been some calls, over the prior couple of years, for ABN AMRO to break up, to merge, or to be acquired. On 21 February 2007, The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) hedge fund called to ask the Chairman of the Supervisory Board to actively investigate a merger, acquisition or breakup of ABN AMRO, stating that the current stock price did not reflect the true value of the underlying assets. TCI asked the chairman to put its request on the agenda of the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in April 2007. Events accelerated on 20 March, when the British bank Barclays and ABN AMRO both confirmed they were in exclusive talks about a possible merger. Acquisition battle. On 28 March 2007, ABN AMRO published the agenda for the shareholders' meeting of 2007. It included all items requested by TCI, but with the recommendation not to follow the request for a breakup of the company. However, on 18 April, another British bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) contacted ABN AMRO to propose a deal in which a consortium of banks, including RBS, Belgium's Fortis, and Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano (now Banco Santander) would jointly bid for ABN AMRO and thereafter divide the components of the company among them. According to the proposed deal, RBS would receive ABN's United States operations, LaSalle, and ABN's wholesale operations; Banco Santander would take the Brazilian operations; and Fortis, the Dutch operations. On 23 April, ABN AMRO and Barclays announced the proposed acquisition of ABN AMRO by Barclays. The deal was valued at €67 billion and included the sale of LaSalle Bank to Bank of America for €21 billion. Two days later, the RBS-led consortium brought out its indicative offer, worth €72 billion, if ABN AMRO would abandon its sale of LaSalle Bank to Bank of America. During the shareholders' meeting the next day, approximately 68 percent of the shareholders voted in favour of the breakup as requested by TCI. The sale of LaSalle was seen as obstructive by many: as a way of blocking the RBS bid, which hinged on further access to the US markets, in order to expand on the success of the group's existing American brands, Citizens Bank and Charter One. On 3 May 2007, the Dutch Investors' Association (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters), with the support of shareholders representing up to 20 percent of ABN's shares, took its case to the Dutch commercial court in Amsterdam, seeking an injunction against the LaSalle sale. The court ruled that the sale of LaSalle could not be viewed apart from the current merger talks of Barclays with ABN AMRO, and that the ABN AMRO shareholders should be able to approve other possible merger/acquisition candidates in a general shareholder meeting. However in July 2007, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that Bank of America's acquisition of LaSalle Bank could proceed and Bank of America absorbed LaSalle effective 1 October 2007. On 23 July 2007, Barclays raised its offer for ABN AMRO to €67.5bn, after securing investments from the governments of China and Singapore, but it was still short of the RBS consortium's offer. Barclay's revised bid was worth €35.73 a share — 4.3% more than its previous offer. The offer, which included 37% cash, remained below the €38.40-a-share offer made the week before by the RFS consortium. The revised offer did not include an offer for La Salle Bank, since ABN AMRO could proceed with the sale of that subsidiary to Bank of America. RBS would now settle for ABN's investment-banking division and its Asian Network. Acquisition and break up. On 30 July 2007, ABN AMRO withdrew its support for Barclays’ offer which was lower than the offer from the group led by RBS. While the Barclays offer matched ABN AMRO’s “strategic vision,” the board couldn’t recommend it from “a financial point of view.” The US$98.3bn bid from RBS, Fortis and Banco Santander was 9.8% higher than Barclays’ offer. Barclays Bank withdrew its bid for ABN AMRO on 5 October, clearing the way for the RBS-led consortium's bid to go through, along with its planned dismemberment of ABN AMRO. Fortis would receive ABN AMRO's Dutch and Belgian operations, Banco Santander would get Banco Real in Brazil, and Banca Antonveneta in Italy and RBS would get ABN AMRO's wholesale division and all other operations, including those in Asia. On 9 October, the RFS consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland, bidding for control of ABN AMRO, formally declared victory after shareholders, representing 86 percent of the Dutch bank’s shares, accepted the RFS group’s €70bn offer. This level of acceptance cleared the way for the consortium to take formal control. The group declared its offer unconditional on October 10, when Fortis completed its €13bn rights issue. Thus the financing required for the group’s €38-a-share offer, which included €35.60 in cash, was realised. Rijkman Groenink, Chairman of the Managing Board of ABN AMRO, who heavily backed the Barclays offer, decided that he would step down. The decline and fall of ABN Amro is reconstructed in the book ""De Prooi"" (Dutch for ""The Prey"") by journalist and professor Jeroen Smit. Impact of the 2008 financial crisis. RBS. On 22 April 2008, RBS announced the largest rights issue in British corporate history, which aimed to raise £12billion in new capital to offset a writedown of £5.9billion resulting from the bad investments and to shore-up its reserves following the purchase of ABN AMRO. On 13 October 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a UK government bailout of the financial system. The Treasury would infuse £37 billion ($64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds TSB and HBOS Plc, to avert financial sector collapse. This resulted in a total government ownership in RBS of 58%. As a consequence of this rescue, the chief executive of the group Fred Goodwin offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. In January 2009, RBS announced a loss of £28bn of which £20bn was due to the ABN AMRO acquisition. At the same time, the government converted its preference shares to ordinary shares resulting in a 70% ownership of RBS. Fortis. On 11 July 2008, Fortis CEO Jean Votron, stepped down after the ABN AMRO deal had depleted Fortis's capital. The total worth of Fortis, as reflected by its stock value, was at that time one-third of what it had been before the acquisition, and just under the value it had paid for the Benelux activities of ABN AMRO. Fortis announced in September of that year that it would sell its stake in RFS Holdings, which included all activities that had not been transferred yet to Fortis (i.e. everything except asset management). Disposals and renaming. In 2008, RFS Holdings completed the sale of a portfolio of private equity interests in 32 European companies managed by AAC Capital Partners to a consortium comprising Goldman Sachs, AlpInvest Partners and the Canada Pension Plan for $1.5 billion through a private equity secondary market transaction. In September 2009, RBS rebranded the Morgans sharedealing business in Australia as RBS Morgans. This followed the rebranding of the ABN AMRO Australia unit to RBS Australia in March that year. On 10 February 2010, RBS announced that branches it owned in India and the United Arab Emirates were to be rebranded under its name. HSBC Holdings said it would buy the Indian retail and commercial banking businesses of Royal Bank of Scotland for $1.8bn, however the deal fell-through in December 2012. Dutch government ownership. Continuing problems with Fortis operations during the 2008 financial crisis led to the Dutch government to obtain full control of all Fortis operations in the Netherlands, including those parts of ABN-AMRO then belonging to Fortis for €16.8bn. The government and the De Nederlandsche Bank president have announced the merger of Dutch Fortis and ABN AMRO parts will proceed while the bank is in state ownership. This was completed in July 2010 when Fortis operations in the Netherlands were rebranded ABN AMRO. In November 2008, a Belgian court dismissed a suit by shareholders of Fortis objecting to the Belgian government's handling of the Fortis/ABN AMRO transaction and subsequent break-up. ABN Amro acquired the specialist on-line mortgage provider ""Direktbank Hypotheken"" as part of the nationalisation and from the 1 January 2011 it stopped selling these products under this brand to the public. It absorbed the mortgage business into its own products under the ABN AMRO brand as well as Florius brand. Goldman Sachs SEC lawsuit. ABN AMRO was mentioned by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court filings when it sued Goldman Sachs and one of Goldman's collateralized debt obligation (CDO) traders on 16 April 2010. The SEC alleges that Goldman created defrauded both IKB Deutsche Industriebank and ABN AMRO by its failure to disclose that the CDOs it sold to both banks were not assembled by a third party, but instead through the guidance of a hedge fund that was counterparty in the CDS transaction. This hedge fund, Paulson & Co., stood to reap great financial benefit in the event of default. Default on gold delivery contracts. On March 2013, ABN AMRO issued a letter to its gold contract customers notifying that it would default on its obligation to deliver allocated gold to its clients. By taking advantage of legal tender laws, the firm offered to compensate the loss to its clients using fiat currency rather than actual gold. Bank operations. ABN AMRO Bank has offices in 15 countries with 32,000 employees, most of whom are based in the Netherlands with only 5,000 in other countries. Its operations include private banking division which focuses on high-net worth clients in 14 countries as well as commercial and merchant banking operations that play a major role in energy, commodities and transportation markets as well as brokerage, Clearing & Custody. Alumni. Former employees of ABN AMRO: Marketing. Name usage and spelling. The bank refers to itself as ABN AMRO in all capitals, based on an acronym of the two originating banks names Algemene Bank Nederland and the Amsterdam and Rotterdam Bank, in the second case the first two letters of each town make up the AMRO. The letters in 'ABN' are pronounced separately and 'AMRO' is pronounced as a word. For this reason some media spell the name as 'ABN Amro'. In written text both versions are used, although the bank itself uses only the uppercase version. In conversations, the bank is sometimes referred to as simply ABN or AMRO bank depending on one's location around the world. Logo and style. The green and yellow shield logo was designed by Landor Associates for ABN AMRO in 1991 and has been used as a brand for the bank and all its subsidiaries. Sponsorships. ABN AMRO was the main sponsor of Dutch football club AFC Ajax between from 1991 to 2008. The sponsor logo was (at the time) the only one in the world to be printed vertically down the right hand side of the front of the shirt. "

wikipedia-384009," L.A. Woman  L.A. Woman is the sixth studio album by The Doors, and the last recorded with lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in July 1971, less than 3 months after the album's release. Its style signified a return to blues, following in the footsteps of ""Morrison Hotel"". Production. Following the departure of their record producer Paul A. Rothchild (who, contrary to popular myth, loved ""Riders on the Storm"" but dismissed the group's differing style on ""Love Her Madly"" as ""cocktail music"") around November 1970, the band fell in to a state of depression and Jim Morrison was obviously bored with Sunset Sound, the studio in which their first two albums were recorded. Bruce Botnick, their engineer, suggested they record at the Doors' workshop. He and the band began production on the album at The Doors Workshop in Los Angeles. Most of the tracks were recorded live, except for a few overdubbed keyboard parts by Ray Manzarek. Morrison recorded his singing in the studio's bathroom to get a fuller sound. Elvis Presley's bass player Jerry Scheff was brought in to play bass on the album, and rhythm guitarist Marc Benno was brought in so that Robbie Krieger could focus on playing lead guitar during live takes. Botnick later produced and mixed a new version of the album, which was released on DVD-Audio on December 19, 2000. It was produced from the original eight-track analog 1"" master tapes. Early LP editions of the album were uniquely packaged: the album's cover was die-cut to remove a near-rectangular piece of it, with a sheet of transparent plastic on which the cover photo of the Doors was printed, glued in place in its stead. Later pressings featured a conventional cover without the die-cut hole and plastic window, and with the group photo printed on the cover itself. Release and reception. The Doors embarked on a tour before completing the album, although it would only comprise two dates. The first was held in Dallas, Texas on December 11, 1970 and reportedly went well. The second performance took place at The Warehouse in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 12, where Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show. John Densmore recalls the incident in his biography ""Riders on the Storm"", where after the show he met with Manzarek and Krieger; they decided to end their live act, citing their mutual agreement that Morrison was ready to retire from performing. By the time the album was released in April 1971, Morrison had moved to Paris, France, where he died three months later, on July 3, 1971. In 2003, ""L.A. Woman"" was ranked #364 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Track listing. The 40th anniversary reissues (released 2007) were completely remixed along with being remastered. This practice extended to incorporating vocal and instrumental components which were not part of the original album. As Manzarek said, ""There are background vocals by Jim Morrison, piano parts of mine that weren't used, and guitar stingers and solos by Robby Krieger that never made the original recordings, that can now be heard for the first time."" "
wikipedia-384011," Moonlight Drive  ""Moonlight Drive"" is a song from The Doors' second album ""Strange Days"", and a B-side of ""Love Me Two Times"". Though a conventional blues arrangement, ""Moonlight Drive""'s defining feature was its slightly off-beat rhythm, and Robby Krieger's 'Bottle-neck' guitar which creates an eerie sound. The song is known to fans as being one of the first written by lead singer Jim Morrison. According to the Morrison biography ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" by Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman, Morrison wrote ""Moonlight Ride"" during his halcyon days on a rooftop in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California in 1965. Later on, when he happened upon friend and future band member Ray Manzarek, he uttered the memorable lines, ""Let's swim to the moon, let's climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide."" Reportedly Manzarek was awestruck, and they decided to form a band. Morrison already had a band name picked out; The Doors. Recordings of live performances of the song reveal a link to a sort of death by drowning - whether murder, suicide or simply going too far. Morrison sings in live performances, probably improvising, referring to ""fishes for your friends"" and ""pearls for your eyes"" conjuring an image of a rotten corpse lying at the bottom of the ocean while simultaneously referencing Shakespeare.  Popular culture. The song was featured in the 1971 film ""Two-Lane Blacktop"". The song was featured in the 1987 film ""Less Than Zero"". The song title is used as the name of professional wrestler John Hennigan's corkscrew neckbreaker finishing move under his Jim Morrison-esque ""John Morrison"" character. "
wikipedia-384013," Carol J. Adams  Carol J. Adams (born 1951) is an American writer, feminist, and animal rights advocate. She is the author of several books, including ""The Sexual Politics of Meat"" (1990) and ""The Pornography of Meat"" (2004), focusing in particular on what she argues are the links between the oppression of women and that of non-human animals. Adams has published around 100 articles or entries in journals, books, magazines, and encyclopedias on vegetarianism, animal rights, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. Biography. Adams was born in Texas. As an undergraduate at the University of Rochester, she was involved in bringing women's studies courses to the University's course catalog. She graduated from there with a BA in 1972, and obtained her MDiv from Yale Divinity School in 1976. She was executive director of the Chautauqua County Rural Ministry, Inc., Dunkirk, New York from the late 1970s to 1987. Adams lives in Texas with her husband, the Reverend Dr. Bruce Buchanan, and is a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Dallas, where her husband is an associate pastor. Adams recalls hearing of the death of her family pony in a hunting accident while at Yale, then eating a hamburger that night. She concluded that it was hypocritical for her to mourn the death of her pony, yet have no problem eating a slaughtered cow. She became a vegetarian that night. She is also a pioneer of feminist care theory in animal ethics. Career. ""The Sexual Politics of Meat"". ""The Sexual Politics of Meat"" discusses how, especially in times of shortage, women often give men the meat they perceive to be the ""best"" food. She also discusses the connections between feminism and vegetarianism, and patriarchy and meat eating, historically and through the reading of literary texts. This describes what she calls the structure of the ""absent referent"", which in this context is that, ""which separates the meat eater from the animal and the animal from the end product."" Other works. She is the author of several other books, including ""Living Among Meat Eaters: The Vegetarian's Survival Handbook"". This book advises vegetarians to ask if they are at peace with their own vegetarianism and provides communication skills for avoiding abuse while dining with meat-eating friends, family, and coworkers who may be hostile. Her book ""The Pornography of Meat"" explores her thesis that United States culture conflates women and meat by analyzing its verbal and visual imagery. Adams was one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book ""Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism"" (2008) by Mark Hawthorne. "
wikipedia-384020," Sarah Emma Edmonds  Sarah Emma Edmonds (December 1841—September 5, 1898), was a Canadian-born woman who is known for serving as a man with the Union Army during the American Civil War. A master of disguise, Edmonds exploits were described in the bestselling ""Nurse and Spy in the Union Army"". In 1992 she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.  Biography. Sarah Emma Edmonds had always been adventurous and her interest in adventure was sparked by a book she read in her youth called Fanny Campbell seriously, the female sailor, telling the story of Fanny Campbell and her adventures on a pirate ship while dressed as a man. Fanny remained dressed as a man in order to pursue other adventures, which Edmonds attributes to her desire to cross dress. During the Civil War, she enlisted in the 2nd Michigan Infantry on her second try, disguising herself as a man named ""Franklin Flint Thompson,"" the middle name possibly after the city she volunteered in, Flint, Michigan. She felt that it was her duty to serve her country and it was truly patriotic. Extensive physical examinations were not required for enlistment at the time, and she was not discovered. She at first served as a male field nurse, participating in several campaigns under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg,and others. However, some historians today say she could not have been at all these different places at the same time. Frank Thompson's career took a turn before the war when a Union spy in Richmond, Virginia was discovered and went before a firing squad, and a friend, James Vesey, was killed in an ambush. She took advantage of the open spot and the opportunity to avenge her friend's death. She applied for, and won, the position as Franklin Thompson. Although there is no proof in her military records that she actually served as a spy, she wrote extensively about her experiences disguised as a spy during the war. Traveling into enemy territory in order to gather information required Emma to come up with many disguises. One disguise required Edmonds to use silver nitrate to dye her skin black, wear a black wig, and walk into the Confederacy disguised as a black man by the name of Cuff. Another time she entered as an Irish peddler woman by the name of Bridget O'Shea, claiming that she was selling apples and soap to the soldiers. Yet another time she was ""working for the Confederates"" as a black laundress when a packet of official papers fell out of an officer's jacket. When Thompson returned to the Union with the papers, the generals were delighted. Another time, she worked as a detective in Maryland as Charles Mayberry, finding an agent for the confederacy Edmonds' career as Frank Thompson came to an end when she contracted malaria. She abandoned her duty in the military, fearing that if she went to a military hospital she would be discovered. She checked herself into a private hospital, intending to return to military life once she had recuperated. Once she recovered, however, she saw posters listing Frank Thompson as a deserter. Rather than return to the army under another alias or as Frank Thompson, risking execution for desertion, she decided to serve as a female nurse at a Washington, D.C. hospital for wounded soldiers run by the United States Christian Commission. There was speculation that Edmonds may have deserted because of John Reid having been discharged months earlier. There is evidence in his diary that she had mentioned leaving before she had contracted malaria. Her fellow soldiers spoke highly of her military service, and even after her disguise was discovered, was considered a good soldier. She was referred to as a fearless soldier and was active in every battle her regiment faced. In 1864 Boston publisher DeWolfe, Fiske, & Co. published Edmonds' account of her military experiences as ""The Female Spy of the Union Army"". One year later her story was picked up by a Hartford, CT publisher who issued it with a new title, ""Nurse and Spy in the Union Army"". It was a huge success, selling in excess of 175,000 copies. In 1867, she married L. H. Seelye, a Canadian mechanic with whom she had three children. In 1886, she received a government pension of $12 a month for her military service, and after some campaigning, gained an honorable discharge. In 1897, she became the only woman admitted to the Grand Army of the Republic, the Civil War Union Army veterans' organization. Edmonds died in La Porte, Texas and is buried in Washington Cemetery in Houston, Texas. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1992. Edmonds' book was reprinted again in 1999 with a new title, ""Memoirs of a Soldier, Nurse and Spy.""

wikipedia-384057," Indra Devi  Eugenie V. Peterson (; May 12, 1899 – April 25, 2002), widely known as Indra Devi, was an early disciple of Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, and herself became a renowned yoga teacher. Born in Riga, she also acted in some Hindi films. Early years. Born in Riga, Russian Empire to Vasili Peterson, a Swedish bank director and Alejandra Labunskaia, a Russian noblewoman, Eugenie attended drama school in Moscow as a girl and escaped to Berlin with her mother as Bolsheviks came to power in 1917. In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer. India. Devi's fascination with India began at 15, when she read a book by poet-philosopher Rabindranath Tagore and a yoga instruction book by Yogi Ramacharaka. In 1927, she sailed for India and adopted a stage name that would sound Hindu (using ""dev"", the Hindi root for ""god"") and acted in Indian films. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, a commercial attache to the Czechoslovak consulate in Bombay. The famous Yoga guru Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya accepted her as a student, only after the Maharaja of Mysore spoke on her behalf and in 1938 she became the first foreign woman among dedicated yogis. She met every challenge Krishnamacharya set out for her and was so successful that the guru asked her to work as a yoga teacher, when he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China and she would leave India. China. In 1939, she opened a school in Shanghai at the house of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast. There were many Americans and Russians among her pupils. More and more people began to call her Mataji, which means mother. Indra Devi was giving lectures on yoga, including free lessons in orphanages. USA. Indra Devi decided to change her life following the unexpected death of her husband.

She died in Buenos Aires. "
wikipedia-384064," Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA; ) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It has been known as the Kennedy–Kassebaum Act after two of its leading sponsors. Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs. Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. This act gives the right to privacy to individuals from age 12 through 18. The provider must have a signed disclosure from the affected before giving out any information on provided health care to anyone, including parents.  The administrative simplification provisions also address the security and privacy of health data. The standards are meant to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the nation's health care system by encouraging the widespread use of electronic data interchange in the U.S. health care system. Title I: Health Care Access, Portability, and Renewability. Title I of HIPAA regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies. It amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code. Title I also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for preexisting conditions. Group health plans may refuse to provide benefits relating to preexisting conditions for a period of 12 months after enrollment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrollment. However, individuals may reduce this exclusion period if they had group health plan coverage or health insurance prior to enrolling in the plan. Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time that they had ""creditable coverage"" prior to enrolling in the plan and after any ""significant breaks"" in coverage. ""Creditable coverage"" is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. A ""significant break"" in coverage is defined as any 63 day period without any creditable coverage. Some health care plans are exempted from Title I requirements, such as long-term health plans and limited-scope plans such as dental or vision plans that are offered separately from the general health plan. However, if such benefits are part of the general health plan, then HIPAA still applies to such benefits. For example, if the new plan offers dental benefits, then it must count creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan towards any of its exclusion periods for dental benefits. An alternate method of calculating creditable continuous coverage is available to the health plan under Title I. That is, 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage. Anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation (e.g., the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage, but only 6 months of dental coverage, because the beneficiary did not have a general health plan that covered dental until 6 months prior to the application date). Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages. Hidden exclusion periods are not valid under Title I (e.g., ""The accident, to be covered, must have occurred while the beneficiary was covered under this exact same health insurance contract""). Such clauses must not be acted upon by the health plan and also must be re-written so that they comply with HIPAA. To illustrate, suppose someone enrolls in a group health plan on January 1, 2006. This person had previously been insured from January 1, 2004 until February 1, 2005 and from August 1, 2005 until December 31, 2005. To determine how much coverage can be credited against the exclusion period in the new plan, start at the enrollment date and count backwards until a significant break in coverage is reached. So, the five months of coverage between August 1, 2005 and December 31, 2005 clearly counts against the exclusion period. But the period without insurance between February 1, 2005 and August 1, 2005 is greater than 63 days. Thus, this is a significant break in coverage, and any coverage prior to it cannot be deducted from the exclusion period. So, this person could deduct five months from his exclusion period, reducing the exclusion period to seven months. Hence, Title I requires that any preexisting condition begin to be covered on August 1, 2006. Title II: Preventing Health Care Fraud and Abuse; Administrative Simplification; Medical Liability Reform. Title II of HIPAA defines policies, procedures and guidelines for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information as well as outlining numerous offenses relating to health care and sets civil and criminal penalties for violations. It also creates several programs to control fraud and abuse within the health care system. However, the most significant provisions of Title II are its Administrative Simplification rules. Title II requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to draft rules aimed at increasing the efficiency of the health care system by creating standards for the use and dissemination of health care information. These rules apply to ""covered entities"" as defined by HIPAA and the HHS. Covered entities include health plans, health care clearinghouses, such as billing services and community health information systems, and health care providers that transmit health care data in a way that is regulated by HIPAA. Per the requirements of Title II, the HHS has promulgated five rules regarding Administrative Simplification: the Privacy Rule, the Transactions and Code Sets Rule, the Security Rule, the Unique Identifiers Rule, and the Enforcement Rule. Privacy Rule. The effective compliance date of the Privacy Rule was April 14, 2003 with a one-year extension for certain ""small plans"". The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) held by ""covered entities"" (generally, health care clearinghouses, employer sponsored health plans, health insurers, and medical service providers that engage in certain transactions.) By regulation, the Department of Health and Human Services extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of ""business associates"". PHI is any information held by a covered entity which concerns health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual's medical record or payment history. Covered entities must disclose PHI to the individual within 30 days upon request. They also must disclose PHI when required to do so by law such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies. Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; or to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person. A covered entity may disclose PHI (Protected Health Information) to facilitate treatment, payment, or health care operations without a patient's express written authorization. Any other disclosures of PHI (Protected Health Information) require the covered entity to obtain written authorization from the individual for the disclosure. However, when a covered entity discloses any PHI, it must make a reasonable effort to disclose only the minimum necessary information required to achieve its purpose. The Privacy Rule gives individuals the right to request that a covered entity correct any inaccurate PHI. It also requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of communications with individuals. For example, an individual can ask to be called at his or her work number instead of home or cell phone numbers. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of uses of their PHI. Covered entities must also keep track of disclosures of PHI and document privacy policies and procedures. They must appoint a Privacy Official and a contact person responsible for receiving complaints and train all members of their workforce in procedures regarding PHI. An individual who believes that the Privacy Rule is not being upheld can file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR). However, according to the ""Wall Street Journal"", the OCR has a long backlog and ignores most complaints. ""Complaints of privacy violations have been piling up at the Department of Health and Human Services. Between April of 2003 and November 2006, the agency fielded 23,886 complaints related to medical-privacy rules, but it has not yet taken any enforcement actions against hospitals, doctors, insurers or anyone else for rule violations. A spokesman for the agency says it has closed three-quarters of the complaints, typically because it found no violation or after it provided informal guidance to the parties involved."" However, in July 2011, UCLA agreed to pay $865,500 in a settlement regarding potential HIPAA violations. An HHS Office for Civil Rights investigation showed that from 2005 to 2008 unauthorized employees repeatedly and without legitimate cause looked at the electronic protected health information of numerous UCLAHS patients. 2013 changes to Privacy Rule. In January 2013, HIPAA was updated to a rule that is often referred to as Omnibus Rule. Protection of PHI was changed from indefinite to 50 years after death. More severe penalties were also approved for violation of PHI privacy. Transactions and Code Sets Rule. HIPAA was intended to make the health care system in the United States more efficient by standardizing health care transactions. HIPAA added a new Part C titled ""Administrative Simplification"" to Title XI of the Social Security Act. This is supposed to simplify health care transactions by requiring all health plans to engage in health care transactions in a standardized way. The HIPAA/EDI provision was scheduled to take effect from October 16, 2003 with a one-year extension for certain ""small plans"". However, due to widespread confusion and difficulty in implementing the rule, CMS granted a one-year extension to all parties. On January 1, 2012 newer versions, ASC X12 005010 and NCPDP D.0 become effective, replacing the previous ASC X12 004010 and NCPDP 5.1 mandate. The ASC X12 005010 version provides a mechanism allowing the use of ICD-10-CM as well as other improvements. After July 1, 2005 most medical providers that file electronically did have to file their electronic claims using the HIPAA standards in order to be paid. Under HIPAA, HIPAA-covered health plans are now required to use standardized HIPAA electronic transactions. See, 42 USC § 1320d-2 and 45 CFR Part 162. Information about this can be found in the final rule for HIPAA electronic transaction standards (74 Fed. Reg. 3296, published in the Federal Register on January 16, 2009), and on the CMS website here:CMS information on HIPAA standardized electronic transactions Key EDI(X12) transactions used for HIPAA compliance are: EDI Health Care Claim Transaction set (837) is used to submit health care claim billing information, encounter information, or both, except for retail pharmacy claims (see EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction). It can be sent from providers of health care services to payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit health care claims and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment. For example, a state mental health agency may mandate all healthcare claims, Providers and health plans who trade professional (medical) health care claims electronically must use the 837 Health Care Claim: Professional standard to send in claims. As there are many different business applications for the Health Care claim, there can be slight derivations to cover off claims involving unique claims such as for Institutions, Professionals, Chiropractors, and Dentists etc. EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction (NCPDP Telecommunications Standard version 5.1) is used to submit retail pharmacy claims to payers by health care professionals who dispense medications, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit claims for retail pharmacy services and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of retail pharmacy services within the pharmacy health care/insurance industry segment. EDI Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) can be used to make a payment, send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB), send an Explanation of Payments (EOP) remittance advice, or make a payment and send an EOP remittance advice only from a health insurer to a health care provider either directly or via a financial institution. EDI Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance Set (834) can be used by employers, unions, government agencies, associations or insurance agencies to enroll members to a payer. The payer is a healthcare organization that pays claims, administers insurance or benefit or product. Examples of payers include an insurance company, health care professional (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), government agency (Medicaid, Medicare etc.) or any organization that may be contracted by one of these former groups. EDI Payroll Deducted and other group Premium Payment for Insurance Products (820) is a transaction set which can be used to make a premium payment for insurance products. It can be used to order a financial institution to make a payment to a payee. EDI Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Inquiry (270) is used to inquire about the health care benefits and eligibility associated with a subscriber or dependent. EDI Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Response (271) is used to respond to a request inquiry about the health care benefits and eligibility associated with a subscriber or dependent. EDI Health Care Claim Status Request (276) This transaction set can be used by a provider, recipient of health care products or services or their authorized agent to request the status of a health care claim. EDI Health Care Claim Status Notification (277) This transaction set can be used by a health care payer or authorized agent to notify a provider, recipient or authorized agent regarding the status of a health care claim or encounter, or to request additional information from the provider regarding a health care claim or encounter. This transaction set is not intended to replace the Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) and therefore, is not used for account payment posting. The notification is at a summary or service line detail level. The notification may be solicited or unsolicited. EDI Health Care Service Review Information (278) This transaction set can be used to transmit health care service information, such as subscriber, patient, demographic, diagnosis or treatment data for the purpose of request for review, certification, notification or reporting the outcome of a health care services review. EDI Functional Acknowledgement Transaction Set (997) this transaction set can be used to define the control structures for a set of acknowledgments to indicate the results of the syntactical analysis of the electronically encoded documents. Although it is not specifically named in the HIPAA Legislation or Final Rule, it is necessary for X12 transaction set processing. The encoded documents are the transaction sets, which are grouped in functional groups, used in defining transactions for business data interchange. This standard does not cover the semantic meaning of the information encoded in the transaction sets. Brief 5010 Transactions and Code Sets Rules Update Summary. 1) Transaction Set (997) will be replaced by Transaction Set (999) ""acknowledgement report"".  2) The size of many fields {segment elements} will be expanded, causing a need for all IT providers to expand corresponding fields, element, files, GUI, paper media and databases.  3) Some segments have been removed from existing Transaction Sets.  4) Many segments have been added to existing Transaction Sets allowing greater tracking and reporting of cost and patient encounters.  5) Capacity to use both ""International Classification of Diseases"" versions 9 (ICD-9) and 10 (ICD-10-CM) has been added. Security Rule. The Final Rule on Security Standards was issued on February 20, 2003. It took effect on April 21, 2003 with a compliance date of April 21, 2005 for most covered entities and April 21, 2006 for ""small plans"". The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule. While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It lays out three types of security safeguards required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various security standards, and for each standard, it names both required and addressable implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. Addressable specifications are more flexible. Individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine the best way to implement addressable specifications. Some privacy advocates have argued that this ""flexibility"" may provide too much latitude to covered entities. The standards and specifications are as follows: Unique Identifiers Rule (National Provider Identifier). HIPAA covered entities such as providers completing electronic transactions, healthcare clearinghouses, and large health plans, must use only the National Provider Identifier (NPI) to identify covered healthcare providers in standard transactions by May 23, 2007. Small health plans must use only the NPI by May 23, 2008. Effective from May 2006 (May 2007 for small health plans), all covered entities using electronic communications (e.g., physicians, hospitals, health insurance companies, and so forth) must use a single new NPI. The NPI replaces all other identifiers used by health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. However, the NPI does not replace a provider's DEA number, state license number, or tax identification number. The NPI is 10 digits (may be alphanumeric), with the last digit being a checksum. The NPI cannot contain any embedded intelligence; in other words, the NPI is simply a number that does not itself have any additional meaning. The NPI is unique and national, never re-used, and except for institutions, a provider usually can have only one. An institution may obtain multiple NPIs for different ""subparts"" such as a free-standing cancer center or rehab facility. Enforcement Rule. On February 16, 2006, HHS issued the Final Rule regarding HIPAA enforcement. It became effective on March 16, 2006. The Enforcement Rule sets civil money penalties for violating HIPAA rules and establishes procedures for investigations and hearings for HIPAA violations. For many years there were few prosecutions for violations. As of March 2013, the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Resources (HHS) has investigated over 19,306 cases that have been resolved by requiring changes in privacy practice or by corrective action. If noncompliance is determined by HHS, entities must apply corrective measures. Complaints have been investigated against many different types of businesses such as national pharmacy chains, major health care centers, insurance groups, hospital chains and other small providers. There were 9,146 cases where the HHC investigation found that HIPAA was followed correctly. There were 44,118 cases that HHS did not find eligible cause for enforcement; for example, a violation that started before HIPAA started; cases withdrawn by the pursuer ; or an activity that does not actually violate the Rules. (hhs.gov/enforcement, 2013) Since the HIPAA Act was enacted by Congress, a total of 79,920 HIPAA complaints have been investigated. According to the HHS website, the following lists the issues that have been turned in according to frequency: The most common entities found to be required to take corrective action in order to be in voluntary compliance according to HHS are listed by frequency:  HITECH Act: Privacy Requirements. See the Privacy section of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). Effects on research and clinical care. The enactment of the Privacy and Security Rules has caused major changes in the way physicians and medical centers operate. The complex legalities and potentially stiff penalties associated with HIPAA, as well as the increase in paperwork and the cost of its implementation, were causes for concern among physicians and medical centers. An August 2006 article in the journal ""Annals of Internal Medicine"" detailed some such concerns over the implementation and effects of HIPAA. Effects on research. HIPAA restrictions on researchers have affected their ability to perform retrospective, chart-based research as well as their ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them for follow-up. A study from the University of Michigan demonstrated that implementation of the HIPAA Privacy rule resulted in a drop from 96% to 34% in the proportion of follow-up surveys completed by study patients being followed after a heart attack. Another study, detailing the effects of HIPAA on recruitment for a study on cancer prevention, demonstrated that HIPAA-mandated changes led to a 73% decrease in patient accrual, a tripling of time spent recruiting patients, and a tripling of mean recruitment costs. In addition, informed consent forms for research studies now are required to include extensive detail on how the participant's protected health information will be kept private. While such information is important, the addition of a lengthy, legalistic section on privacy may make these already complex documents even less user-friendly for patients who are asked to read and sign them. These data suggest that the HIPAA privacy rule, as currently implemented, may be having negative impacts on the cost and quality of medical research. Dr. Kim Eagle, professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, was quoted in the ""Annals"" article as saying, ""Privacy is important, but research is also important for improving care. We hope that we will figure this out and do it right."" Effects on clinical care. The complexity of HIPAA, combined with potentially stiff penalties for violators, can lead physicians and medical centers to withhold information from those who may have a right to it. A review of the implementation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that health care providers were ""uncertain about their legal privacy responsibilities and often responded with an overly guarded approach to disclosing information...than necessary to ensure compliance with the Privacy rule"". Reports of this uncertainty continue. Costs of implementation. In the period immediately prior to the enactment of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts, medical centers and medical practices were charged with getting ""into compliance"". With an early emphasis on the potentially severe penalties associated with violation, many practices and centers turned to private, for-profit ""HIPAA consultants"" who were intimately familiar with the details of the legislation and offered their services to ensure that physicians and medical centers were fully ""in compliance"". In addition to the costs of developing and revamping systems and practices, the increase in paperwork and staff time necessary to meet the legal requirements of HIPAA may impact the finances of medical centers and practices at a time when insurance companies and Medicare reimbursement is also declining. Education and Training. Education and training of healthcare providers is paramount to correct implementation of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts. Effective training must describe the statutory and regulatory background and purpose of HIPAA and a general summary of the principles and key provisions of the Privacy Rule. Explain and define the type of entities that are covered by the Privacy Rule. The term business associate is defined, as are the requirements of the Privacy Rule when they carry out health care activities and functions on behalf of covered entities. Describes Privacy Rule provisions that address how entity organization may affect privacy functions, Describes the health information that is protected by the Privacy Rule. The presentation extensively describes the required and permitted uses and disclosures of PHI by a covered entity or its business associate, including situations where PHI may be used or disclosed without the individual’s authorization and when such authorization is required. The Rule’s minimum necessary provisions and its requirements are explained. Summarizes the Privacy Rule’s provisions and requirements related to research. Describes when a covered entity may use and disclose PHI for research purposes and what research is affected. The presentation illustrates the relationship of the Privacy Rule’s research provisions to other research rules, such as the Common Rule. Describes the Privacy Rule’s administrative requirements for covered entities, such as policies and procedures, data safeguards, documentation and record retention, prohibition on retaliation, complaints to the covered entity, workforce training and sanctions. HIPAA and drug and alcohol rehabilitation organizations. Special considerations for confidentiality are needed for health care organizations that offer federally-funded drug or alcohol rehabilitation services. Predating HIPAA by over a quarter century are the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 and language amended by the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972. Notable Violations. In 2012, two executives at Prime Healthcare Services disclosed a patient's chart to multiple media outlets without the patient's consent. The release was in response to a California Watch article on Prime Healthcare Services billing practices at Shasta Regional Medical Center. In this incident, Randall Hempling, the hospital CEO, and Dr. Marcia McCampbell, its chief medical officer, showed up at the offices of the Redding Record Searchlight with Darlene Courtois in order to refute an article which was about to be published. Courtois did not consent to this release as is required under HIPAA. The hospital admits that they did not have written consent, but instead claim that: ""As far as we're concerned, the patient gave that permission when she gave her records to California Watch and was quoted on the record. That waived her privacy."" But under HIPAA, there is no such thing as implied authorization. The FBI has questioned Courtois in regard to this information release. "
wikipedia-384070," AS-202  AS-202 (also referred to as SA-202) was the second unmanned, suborbital test flight of a production Block I Apollo Command/Service Module launched with the Saturn IB launch vehicle. It launched August 25, 1966 and was the first flight which included the spacecraft Guidance and Navigation Control system and fuel cells. The success of this flight enabled the Apollo program to judge the Block I spacecraft and Saturn IB ready to carry men into orbit. Objectives. AS-202 was the third test flight of the Saturn IB, because a delay in the readiness of the Apollo spacecraft 011 pushed its launch past the July 1966 launch of AS-203. It was designed to test the rocket more than had been done on AS-201 by launching the rocket higher and having the flight lasting twice as long. It would also test the Command and Service Module (CSM-011) by having the engine firing four times during the flight. The flight was also designed to test out the heat shield by subjecting it to 260 megajoules per square meter. Over the course of the reentry it generated equivalent energy needed to power Los Angeles for over one minute in 1966. CSM-011 was basically a production model capable of carrying a crew. However it lacked the crew couches and some displays that would be included on later missions for the astronauts. This was the first flight of the guidance and navigation system as well as the fuel cell electrical system. Flight. AS-202 was launched 25 August 1966 from Pad 34. The launch phase was perfectly nominal with the first stage burning for just under two and a half minutes, lifting the rocket to an altitude of , downrange from the launch pad. The second stage then burned for a further seven and half minutes, putting the spacecraft into a ballistic trajectory. The CSM was separated from the rocket stage at an altitude of . The CSM was preprogrammed to make four burns of its Service Propulsion System (SPS). The first occurred a couple of seconds after separation from the S-IVB second stage. It burned for 3 minutes, 35 seconds, lifting the spacecraft apogee to , downrange. The second burn was 25 minutes later, lasting one minute 28 seconds. Ten seconds later, two more burns of three seconds each were done to test the rapid restart capabilities of the engine. The Command Module entered the atmosphere at a speed of . The spacecraft performed a skip reentry, first descending to , then lifting back up to . By this time it had shed of speed. It then continued to descend. The main parachutes deployed at . It splashed down at 16.12° N - 168.9° E, from the target landing site, and the USS ""Hornet"" took 8 hours and 30 minutes to reach the capsule. Capsule location. The capsule is currently on display on the ""Hornet"". The ship is open to the public as a museum in Alameda, California. "

wikipedia-384080," Non-partisan democracy  Nonpartisan democracy (also no-party democracy) is a system of representative government or organization such that universal and periodic elections take place without reference to political parties. Overview. Sometimes electioneering and even speaking about candidates may be discouraged, so as not to prejudice others' decisions or create a contentious atmosphere. Nonpartisan democracies may possess indirect elections whereby an electorate are chosen who in turn vote for the representative(s). (This is sometimes known as a 2-tier election, such as an electoral college.) The system can work with a first past the post electoral system but is incompatible with (partisan) proportional representation systems other than Single Transferable Vote. A nonpartisan system differs from a single-party system in that the governing faction in a single-party system identifies itself as a party, where membership might provide benefits not available to non-members. A single-party government often requires government officials to be members of the party, features a complex party hierarchy as a key institution of government, forces citizens to agree to a partisan ideology, and may enforce its control over the government by making all other parties illegal. Members of a nonpartisan government may not share any ideologies (though in voluntary organizations, they of course may). Various communist nations such as China or Cuba are single-party nations although the Members of Parliament are not elected as Party candidates.  A direct democracy can be considered nonpartisan since citizens vote on laws themselves rather than electing representatives. Direct democracy can be partisan, however, if factions are given rights or prerogatives that non-members do not have. In many nations, the head of state is nonpartisan, even if the prime minister and parliament are chosen in partisan elections. The heads of state are expected to remain neutral with regards to partisan politics. There are two basic types of nonpartisan governments - de facto and de jure. De facto nonpartisan governments are ones where no laws prevent the formation of political parties, but no parties exist. Most of the de facto nonpartisan governments represent very small populations, such as in Niue, Tuvalu, and Palau. On the other hand, governments that outlaw political parties but do have elections are de jure nonpartisan systems. Several de jure nonpartisan national governments are Persian Gulf states, such as Oman and Kuwait. The legislatures in these Gulf state nonpartisan governments typically have advisory capacity only (i.e. - They may comment on laws proposed by the executive branch, but are unable to create real laws themselves.), but are partially or entirely elected by citizens. Unless there are legal restrictions on political parties, factions within nonpartisan governments may evolve into political parties. The United States of America initially did not have enfranchised political parties, but these evolved soon after independence. History. The democracy of ancient Athens was a nonpartisan, direct democracy where eligible citizens voted on laws themselves rather than electing representatives. Historians have frequently interpreted Federalist No. 10 to imply that the Founding Fathers of the United States intended the government to be nonpartisan. James Madison defined a faction as ""a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."" As political parties had interests which were adverse to the rights of citizens and to the general welfare of the nation, several Founding Fathers preferred a nonpartisan form of government. The administration of George Washington and the first few sessions of the US Congress were nonpartisan. Factions within the early US government coalesced into the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. The Era of Good Feeling, when the Federalist party collapsed, leaving the Democratic-Republican party as the sole political faction, was the United States' only experience with a single-party system. The Non-Partisan League was an influential socialist political movement in the United States, especially in the Upper Midwest, particularly during the 1910s and 1920s. It also contributed much to the ideology of the former Progressive Party of Canada. It went into decline and merged with the Democratic Party of North Dakota in 1956. The Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers movement (which formed governments in the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario) also acted on a similar philosophy. In the case of the United Farmers of Ontario while in power (1919–1923) the administration of Ernest Drury suffered lots of infighting as the result of conflicting views. Because of their nonpartisan ideology the Progressive Party of Canada refused to take the position of the official opposition after the election of 1921 when they came in second place. Four years later they lost that position and their rural supporters began to move to the Liberal Party and CCF. Eventually the Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers movement faded into obscurity with most of their members joining the Liberal Party of Canada and the democratic socialist, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, or present day New Democratic Party). Structures. Elections. In nonpartisan elections, each candidate for office is eligible based on her or his own merits rather than as a member of a political party. No political affiliation (if one exists) is shown on the ballot next to a candidate. Generally, the winner is chosen from a runoff election where the candidates are the top two vote-getters from a primary election. In some elections, the candidates might be members of a national party, but do not run as party members for local office. Louisiana uses a nonpartisan blanket primary, also called a ""jungle primary"", for state and local offices. In this system, all candidates run against each other regardless of party affiliation during the primary, and then the two most popular candidates run against each other even if they are members of the same party. This form of runoff election weakens political parties and transforms a partisan election into a partly nonpartisan election. Once a candidate gets elected, the person maintains party affiliation and generally votes along party lines. Louisiana is the only place that uses a nonpartisan blanket primary. Nebraska uses a single nonpartisan primary for the State Legislature but not for other state and local races. Nonpartisan elections are generally held for municipal and county offices, especially school board, and are also common in the election of judges. In some nonpartisan elections, it is common knowledge which candidates are members of and backed by which parties; in others, parties are almost wholly uninvolved and voters make choices with little or no regard to partisan considerations. While nonpartisan democracies can allow for a wide selection of candidates (especially within a no-nomination system whereby voters can choose any non-restricted person in their area), such systems are not incompatible with indirect elections (such as for large geographical areas), whereby delegates may be chosen who in turn elect the representatives. Appointments. Even if a government's executive officer or legislature is partisan, appointments of cabinet members, judges, or directors of government agencies, may be nonpartisan. The intent of appointing government officials in a nonpartisan manner is to insure the officers can perform their duties free from partisan politics, and are chosen in a fair manner that does not adversely affect a political party. Twelve US states use the Missouri Plan, and two use a variation of it, to choose judges in a nonpartisan manner. Several countries with partisan parliaments use nonpartisan appointments to choose presidents. Legislatures. In nonpartisan legislatures, there are no typically formal party alignments within the legislature; even if there are caucuses for specific issues. Alliances and causes with a nonpartisan body are often temporary and fluid since legislators who oppose each other on some issues may agree on other issues. Despite being nonpartisan, legislators typically have consistent and identifiable voting patterns. Decisions to investigate and enforce ethics violations by government officials are generally done on the basis of evidence instead of party affiliation. Committee chairs and other leaders within the legislature are often chosen for seniority and expertise, unlike the leaders in a partisan legislature who are often chosen because of loyalty to a party. Examples. National governments. Very few national governments are completely nonpartisan, but nonpartisan political systems at the national level are not unheard of. Many national governments have nonpartisan offices even if their legislative branches are partisan. Constitutional monarchies have nonpartisan monarchs as their head of state. Parliamentary republics generally have nonpartisan, figurehead presidents. Nonpartisan governments are much more likely in countries with small populations. Nauru, for example, has no political parties; its Parliament consists entirely in independent members of parliament or MPs, who form governing coalitions and opposition blocs through alliances of individuals. The same is true in Tuvalu. No political parties exist; ""MPs have very close links with their island constituencies and effort is directed towards balancing island representation in Cabinet"" Other nonpartisan island nations are Pitcairn, Micronesia, Saint Helena, and Palau. Some are de facto nonpartisan because no law forbids the formation of political parties, and the populations are small enough that factions are considered unnecessary. Political allegiances depend mainly on family and island-related factors. In Niue, political parties have never played an important role. There is, at present, no political party, and candidates to elections therefore run as independents. The only party ever to have existed, the Niue People's Party, disbanded in 2003. The United Arab Emirates is a de jure nonpartisan semi-democratic state since all political parties were outlawed. The Federal National Council (al-Majlis al-Watani al-Ittihadi) is the UAE’s parliamentary body and consists of 40 members, representing the Emirates, half appointed by the rulers of the constituent states and the other half elected to serve two-year terms, with only advisory tasks. Political parties are illegal in the Gulf state of Kuwait. They have not been legalized since independence in 1961. Nonetheless, the constitution itself does not explicitly prohibit parties. Candidates for election to the National Assembly of Kuwait stand in a personal capacity. In practice, however, several political groups act as de facto parties. Libya's unicameral legislature, the General National Congress reserved 120 out of its 200 seats for independent politicians in multiple-member districts. The other 80 were elected through a party list system of proportional representation. Oman does not allow political parties and only holds elections with expanding suffrage for a consultative assembly. Though Oman is developing into a constitutional monarchy, political parties are not yet allowed in Oman. The previously influential opposition movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, is dormant today. In Saudi Arabia no political parties are allowed. The Vatican State is a nonpartisan theocracy.  A nonpartisan democracy might take root in other sovereign nations, such as occurred in Uganda in 1986, whereby political parties were restricted by a constitutional referendum endorsed by the people of the country (this system did not have all of the features described above). During a subsequent referendum in 2005, over 92% of Ugandan citizens voted for the return of a multiple party system. The Confederate States of America had no political parties during its entire existence from 1861 to 1865. Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. ""Anti-partyism became an article of political faith."" Without a two party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, ""negative, carping and petty"". The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, this lack of a functioning two-party system caused ""real and direct damage"" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration. Legislative elections in the Confederacy were decided without political parties. Key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property. Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were exempted from military duty. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. The absence of political parties made individual roll call voting all the more important, as the Confederate ""freedom of roll-call voting unprecedented in American legislative history. Until the mid-20th century, a Canadian politician's political affiliation was not shown on ballots at any level of government. The expectation was that citizens would vote according to the merit of the candidate, but in practice, party allegiance played an important role. Beginning in 1974, the name of the candidate's political party was shown on the ballot. Territorial governments. The territorial government of American Samoa is completely nonpartisan. It has 21 nonpartisan members elected by consensus to its Territorial House and 18 nonpartisan members elected to the Territorial Senate. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are both nonpartisan offices. However, its nonvoting member of the U.S. House is a Democrat. The British territory of Falkland Islands has a completely nonpartisan government in that no political parties operate on the islands. All eight members of the Legislative Assembly are nonpartisan, as is the Chief Executive and the Governor. Guernsey has a nonpartisan legislature. The States of Guernsey, officially called the States of Deliberation, consists of 45 People's Deputies, elected from multi- or single-member districts every four years. Political parties played no official role in the Isle of Man before the 2006 elections and played a minor role in the 2006 elections. At the 2001 election for the House of Keys, the Manx Labour Party polled 17.3% of the vote and only 2 seats. The vast majority of seats at every election are won by independent candidates with no allegiance to any parties. The head of the territory and head of government of Hong Kong, the Chief Executive, is required by law not to be member of any political party. There are political parties, but there is no legislation for political parties. State or provincial governments. There are several examples of nonpartisan state or provincial governments. The nonpartisan system is also used in many US states for the election of judges, district attorneys and other officials. The Swiss Cantons of Glarus and Appenzell Innerrhoden are also nonpartisan, direct democracies; while they have a partisan parliament, all laws have to be passed by ""Landsgemeinde"", an assembly of all citizens eligible to vote. Twelve US states use the Missouri Plan, and two use a variation of it, to choose judges in a nonpartisan manner. The Canadian territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have nonpartisan democracies. The populace votes for individuals to represent it in the territorial assembly without reference to political parties. After the election, the assembly selects one of its number to form a government and act as premier. This system is in deference to the system of consensus government that predominates among the indigenous Inuit and other peoples of northern Canada. The state of Nebraska in the United States has nonpartisan elections for its legislature because candidates are neither endorsed nor supported by political parties. However, its executive branch is elected on a partisan basis. It is the only state in the United States with a nonpartisan legislature. Governors of Japanese prefectures are required by law not to be members of any political party. Municipal governments. The municipal government of the City of Toronto, Ontario (Canada) is the fifth largest government in the country, governing a population of more than 2.7 million. It consists of a nonpartisan, directly elected council. The public may have a general idea of the candidates' political affiliations, but their parties have no official recognition or privilege in the functioning of City Council. Councilors are free to vote on each motion individually, freeing them from party discipline. "
wikipedia-384081," Health Level 7  Health Level Seven (HL7), is a non-profit organization involved in the development of international healthcare informatics interoperability standards. ""HL7"" also refers to some of the specific standards created by the organization (e.g., HL7 v2.x, v3.0, HL7 RIM). HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. The 2.x versions of the standards, which support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services, are the most commonly used in the world. Organization. HL7 is an international community of healthcare subject matter experts and information scientists collaborating to create standards for the exchange, management and integration of electronic healthcare information. HL7 promotes the use of such informatics standards within and among healthcare organizations to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare information delivery for the benefit of all. The HL7 community is organized in the form of a global organization (Health Level Seven, Inc.) and country-specific affiliate organizations: The organizational structure of HL7 Inc. is as follows: Origin. HL7 was founded in 1987 to produce a standard for hospital information systems. HL7, Inc. is a standards organization that was accredited in 1994 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). HL7 is one of several American National Standards Institute accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena. Most of these SDOs produce standards (sometimes called specifications or protocols) for a particular healthcare domain such as pharmacy, medical devices, imaging or insurance (claims processing) transactions. Health Level Seven’s domain is clinical and administrative data. Today, HL7 has been adopted by several national SDOs outside the United States. Those SDOs are consequently not accredited by ANSI. However, HL7 is now adopted by ISO as a centre of gravity in international standardization and accredited as a partnering organization for mutual issuing of standards. The first mutually published standard is ISO/HL7 21731:2006 Health informatics—HL7 version 3—Reference information model—Release 1. The name ""Health Level-7"". The name ""Health Level-7"" is a reference to the seventh layer of the ISO OSI Reference model also known as the application layer. The name indicates that HL7 focuses on application layer protocols for the health care domain, independent of lower layers. HL7 effectively considers all lower layers merely as tools. Collaboration. HL7 collaborates with other standards development organizations and national and international sanctioning bodies (e.g. ANSI and ISO), in both the healthcare and information infrastructure domains to promote the use of supportive and compatible standards. HL7 collaborates with healthcare information technology users to ensure that HL7 standards meet real-world requirements, and that appropriate standards development efforts are initiated by HL7 to meet emergent requirements. About 45% of the global membership (of either HL7 Inc. or an HL7 affiliate) is located in Europe, 35% in North America, 15% in Asia-Oceania and 5% elsewhere. HL7 standards. HL7 encompasses the complete life cycle of a standards specification including the development, adoption, market recognition, utilization, and adherence. Prior to April 2013, HL7 International asserted that business use of the HL7 standards required a paid organizational membership in HL7, Inc. HL7 Members could access standards for free, and non-members could buy the standards from HL7, ANSI, or for some standards, ISO. Most HL7 standards can now be deemed Open Standards, as since April 2013 they are available for free download. On Sept 4, 2012, the HL7 Board of Directors had announced its intention to relax the HL7 IP policy and allow free access and implementation to promote adoption and interoperability, as described in their press release. The revenue model and business plan of HL7 is discussed in HL7's Strategic Initiatives and Implementation Proposal. However, since the earlier policy as described in the Bylaws of October 2002 placed the HL7 protocol specifications in the Public Domain, and under 17 USC § 102 there is no copyright protection for an ""idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery"", this revised policy may not be enforceable. Hospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking. All of these systems should communicate with each other (or ""interface"") when they receive new information but not all do so. HL7 specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable. HL7 develops conceptual standards (e.g., HL7 RIM), document standards (e.g., HL7 CDA), application standards (e.g., HL7 CCOW), and messaging standards (e.g., HL7 v2.x and v3.0). Messaging standards are particularly important because they define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another. Such standards set the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration from one system to another. The Reference Information Model (RIM) and the HL7 Development Framework (HDF) are the basis of the HL7 Version 3 standards development process. RIM is the representation of the HL7 clinical data (domains) and the life cycle of messages or groups of messages. HDF is a project to specify the processes and methodology used by all the HL7 committees for project initiation, requirements analysis, standard design, implementation, standard approval process, etc. HL7 standards: HL7 version 2.x. The HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989. V2.x Messaging HL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.6. The v2.x standards are backward compatible (e.g., a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6). HL7 v2.x messages use a human-readable (ASCII), non-XML encoding syntax based on segments (lines) and one-character delimiters. Segments have composites (fields) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are vertical bar or pipe (|) for the field separator, caret (^) for the component separator, and ampersand (&) for the subcomponent separator. The tilde (~) is the default repetition separator. The first field (composite) in each segment contains the 3-character segment name. Each segment of the message contains one specific category of information. Every message has MSH as its first segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type determines the expected segment names in the message. The segment names for a particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the HL7 standards. The following is an example of an admission record. MSH is the header record, PID the Patient Identity, etc. The 5th field for the PID record is the patient's name. codice_1 HL7 v2.x has allowed for the interoperability between electronic Patient Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems, Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well as Electronic Medical Record (EMR) or Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Currently, HL7’s v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical information systems vendor in the United States. HL7 version 3. The HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object-oriented principles. RIM - ISO/HL7 21731 The Reference Information Model (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the semantic and lexical connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages. The RIM is essential to increase precision and reduce implementation costs. Models are available. HL7 Development Framework - ISO/HL7 27931 The HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems. The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information system interoperability. The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology. The HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements. HL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources. The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using. V3 Messaging The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of electronic messages (called ""interactions"") to support all healthcare workflows. HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax. COMMENT: Please insert sample HL7 version 3 Data Markup Example Here: Clinical Document Architecture - ISO/HL7 27932. The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. Methods applied by HL7. Services Aware Interoperability Framework. The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency. SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach. SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management. Arden syntax. The Arden syntax is a language for encoding medical knowledge. HL7 adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions. They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support. An MLM must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed. Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed. MLLP. A large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP). For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft and Oracle. CCOW. CCOW, or ""Clinical Context Object Workgroup,"" is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level. CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications. Functional EHR and PHR specifications. Functional specifications for an electronic health record. Country specific aspects. Australia. HL7 Australia was established in 1998. Australia was an early adopter of the HL7 V2.x standards, which are now used ubiquitously in Australian public and private healthcare organisations. The localisation of the HL7 standards is undertaken in cooperation with the national standards body, Standards Australia. HL7 Australia closely cooperates with the National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA). Australia has been selected to host the International HL7 Interoperability Conference in 2013. This will be a two day event in Sydney from 28 – 30 October 2013. Proposed themes for the event include: • HL7/FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), • CDA implementation and innovation, • Leveraging HL7v2.x investment, and • Emerging developments: CIMI, clinical terminology & semantic web Canada. HL7 within Canada is supported by the HL7 Canadian Constituency, which is hosted by the Canadian Health Infoway Standards Collaborative. Among its support for domestic and international activities are: Notable HL7 implementations currently include Prince Edward Island's drug information system (DIS). Czech republic. Czech republic has a national HL7 organization since 2001. In addition to HL7 standards, EHR systems in the Czech republic use a national interface (called DASTA) endorsed by the Ministry of Health (Czech Republic) Finland. National Health Archive http://www.kanta.fi/en The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, together with other health and welfare bodies in Finland have been rolling out a national health care database based on HL7 CDA R2 and V3 messages. The system is known by the acronym KanTa which is an abbreviation of KANsallinen TerveysArkisto (National Health Archive). The word KANTA in Finnish means ""base"", ""stem"" or ""heel"". Currently (as at February 2013) the system holds details of all electronic prescriptions and all pharmacies in Finland are connected to the database. The system enables prescriptions to be written by any medically qualified doctor into the system and enables the patient to collect prescriptions from any pharmacy nationwide. Citizens can log into the system via the internet using an authentication service and see their own record. There is a choice of using a government controlled authorization system or using the same authentication service used for on-line banking. These services use one-time (i.e. non repeating log in identifiers) which minimizes the risk of phishing or other intercepts. By logging into the system, the patient can see what medicines have been prescribed, which doctor prescribed them and when, what prescriptions have been collected from which pharmacy and on which date, and what the price paid was. The latter is useful for patients taking expensive medications because there is a national ceiling on patient medical costs so that the government will 100% of costs over the ceiling under the social insurance program. The record also shows what the dose should be, the name of the doctor who prescribed the medication, and what quantities of prescribed medications are still available for collection, subject to controls around the amount of medication is allowed to store at home. The system alerts doctors and pharmacies to prevent simultaneous use of incompatible medicines. For regular prescriptions, when the last prescription is fulfilled, the pharmacist can ask the patient if he would like the doctor to be asked to repeat issue the prescription. If yes, the pharmacy issues the request electronically and the doctor must either renew, modify, or terminate the prescription within 8 days. The patient can choose to receive a text message to his/her mobile phone advising of the outcome. Still being rolled out is the second phase of the project which is to enable the national database to be used to store other patient medical records. This is subject to the patient consenting for the transfer of data from his home health service station into the national archive. Patients thus have control over their own records, though most are expected to see the benefits of having their records in a permanently available national register. Version 2 HL7 messaging is widely deployed in most hospitals and healthcare centers. CDA R1 is used in sharing patient records on a regional level. Germany. The German chapter of HL7 was founded in 1993. This is an entity for benefit to the public and registered as an association as HL7 e. V. Due to federal structure of operational administration in German healthcare, the standardization aspect is much behind the possibilities of the public economy and due to competitive interests in industry of low normative impact to healthcare information systems development. Currently HL7 in Germany operates as an informal cluster and collaborates with the national standardization body. The voluntary membership in HL7 relies on personal interest and engagement of clinical users and mainly on industrial interest: Clinical memberships are in minority. There is low membership of governmental administration and thus low contribution to ongoing discussion e.g. on patient data records (EPA = elektronische Patientenakte) balancing data availability vs. data security. Impact on productivity for hospital information systems (called KIS = Krankenhaus-Informationssysteme in German) is of no importance yet, as the variability of HIS systems has not been challenged by HL7. Governmental funding for a broader adoption of HL7 does yet not exist in Germany, neither on federal level nor in most of the regional governments. India. HL7 India is active in conducting e-learning courses for HL7 and HL7 certification examinations. Italy. HL7 Italia was established in 2003 and it is responsible for the localization of this standard in the Italian context. The aim is to stimulate and direct the regional and national contributions towards the standard development and to promote the modernization of Italian health IT. HL7 Italia members are suppliers of health IT market. Some Italian regions, regional In-Houses, Governative Agencies, Public Research Institutes, local Hospital departments and individual IT professionals are HL7 Italia members. The Netherlands. AORTA - National Healthcare ICT infrastructure AORTA is the Dutch national infrastructure for the exchange of data between healthcare providers. AORTA uses HL7 version 3 messages and documents as its core mechanism for information exchange. The initial specifications were created in 2003.  The Dutch Ministry of Health is working on a virtual national Electronic Patient Records (EPR) which will enable healthcare providers to share patient data. This development takes place in close collaboration with Nictiz, the National Information and Communication Technology Institute for Healthcare. Nictiz coordinates its efforts with regard to the usage of HL7 version 3 with the volunteers of HL7 the Netherlands. Almost all hospitals use HL7 version 2 to support hospital-internal workflows. EDIfact is being used to support workflows involving general practitioners (GPs/PCPs). EDIfact will be gradually replaced by HL7 version 3.  Pakistan. HLH - Health Life Horizon HLH (a national project) is being carried out at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of National University of Sciences and Technology and is supported by Government of Pakistan with funds provided by National ICT R&D Fund. HLH basic theme is to target health care information exchange and interoperability using HL7 version 3. Though the penetration and use of HL7 in Pakistan is lower than the countries like US and that of Europe. But its getting popularity among the stakeholders in Pakistan. HLH Team members have been participating in HL7 International Working Group meetings and conferences for last two years. On Oct 1, 2010 HL7 International formally announced the Pakistan Chapter at the 24th Plenary and WGM in Cambridge, MA, USA. Pakistan is now the 37th affiliate of HL7 International around the world. HL7 Pakistan is now officially authorized to give memberships to local organizations along with other privileges like certification, training, etc. USA. Laika The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) has developed an open-source program called Laika to test EHR software for compliance with CCHIT interoperability standards. HIPAA HL7’s initial involvement in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) legislation began in 1996 with the formation of the Attachments special interest group to standardize the supplemental information needed to support health care insurance, and other e-commerce transactions. The initial deliverable of this group was a set of six recommended Claims Attachments for the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) process. Future attachment projects include, but are not limited to, Home Health, Skilled Nursing Facility, durable medical equipment (DME), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and Pre-Authorization and Referrals. The Attachment special interest group is responsible for implementing the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA mandates, providing on-going support, and representing HL7 in the Designated Standards Maintenance Organization (DSMO) efforts. Its purpose is to encourage the use of HL7 for uniform implementation of this supplemental information. This SIG coordinates industry input to produce and maintain guides for HL7 messages that can stand alone or be embedded within ANSI X12 transactions. ARRA and HITECH The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) legislation specified HL7 versions 2.3.1 and 2.5.1, and the HL7 Continuity of Care Document (CCD), as the healthcare standards to meet certain certification requirements. "
wikipedia-384088," James Seddon  James Alexander Seddon (July 13, 1815 – August 19, 1880) was an American lawyer and politician who served two terms as a Representative in the U.S. Congress, as a member of the Democratic Party. He was appointed Confederate States Secretary of War by Jefferson Davis during the American Civil War. Biography. Born in Falmouth, Stafford County, Virginia, Seddon was a descendant of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling. Due to frail health, Seddon was educated primarily at home and became self-taught as a youth. At the age of twenty-one, he entered the law school of the University of Virginia. After graduation, Seddon settled in Richmond, where he established a successful law practice.  In 1845, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for Congress and was easily elected. Two years later, he was renominated, but declined due to platform differences with the party. In 1849, Seddon was reelected to Congress, serving from December 1849 until March 1851. Owing to poor health, he declined another nomination at the end of his term and retired to ""Sabot Hill,"" his estate on the James River above Richmond. Seddon attended the peace convention held in Washington, D.C., in 1861, which attempted to devise a means of preventing the impending civil war. Later in the same year, he attended the Provisional Confederate Congress. President Davis named him as the Secretary of War, a post he held until January 1, 1865, when he retired from public life to his country estate. Electoral History. 1845. Seddon was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 52.28% of the vote, defeating Whig JohnMinor Botts. 1849. Seddon was re-elected with 53.64% of the vote, defeating Whig Botts. "
wikipedia-384095," Jack Daniel's  Jack Daniel's is a brand of sour mash Tennessee whiskey that is the highest selling American whiskey in the world. It is known for its square bottles and black label. It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 1956. Despite being the location of a major operational distillery, Jack Daniel's home county of Moore is a dry county, so the product is not available for consumption at stores or restaurants within the county.  Although the product generally meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon, the company disavows this classification and markets it simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. Early history. According to the Jack Daniel's website, founder Jasper Newton ""Jack"" Daniel was born in September 1850, although seemingly no one knows the exact date because the birth records were destroyed in a courthouse fire. If the 1850 date is correct, he might hypothetically have become a licensed distiller at the age of 16, as the brand label says ""Est. & Reg. in 1866"". Other records list his birth date as September 5, 1846, and in the 2004 biography ""Blood & Whiskey: The Life and Times of Jack Daniel"", author Peter Krass maintains that land and deed records show that the distillery was actually not founded until 1875 (the date also suggested by the Tennessee state library, estimating that he was 29 when the distillery was founded). Jack was one of twelve children fathered by Calaway Daniel. Jack's mother, Lucinda Cook Daniel, died in 1847 (which would have made it difficult for her to give birth to him in 1850), after which his father remarried and had several more children. Jack Daniel's grandfather, Joseph ""Job"" Daniel emigrated from Wales as did his Scottish wife to the United States. He was of Welsh, Scottish, English, and Scots-Irish descent. In 2012, a Welshman, Mark Evans, claimed to have discovered the original recipe, in a book written by his great-great-grandmother in 1853, whose brother-in-law emigrated to Tennessee. Jack died in 1911 from blood poisoning which started from an infection. The infection allegedly began in one of his toes, which Daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open (he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination). Jack Daniel never married and did not have any children. However, he took his favorite nephew, Lem Motlow, under his wing. Lem was very skilled with numbers, and was soon doing all of the distillery's bookkeeping. In 1907, due to failing health, Jack Daniel gave the distillery to Motlow, who then bequeathed the distillery to his children, Robert, Reagor, Dan, Conner, and Mary, upon his death in 1947. Tennessee passed a state-wide prohibition law in 1910, preventing the legal distillation of Jack Daniel's in the state, and as a result Lem Motlow began distilling operations in St Louis, Missouri and Birmingham, Alabama, though none of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems. The introduction of prohibition in 1920 (until 1933) through the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution stopped production in St Louis; production in Alabama having been stopped earlier by that state's prohibition laws. All production then ceased. Even the Twenty-first Amendment enactment in 1933 repealing federal prohibition did not allow production in Lynchburg to restart, as the Tennessee state prohibition laws were still in effect. Motlow, as a Tennessee state senator, helped repeal these laws, allowing production to restart in 1938. The five-year gap between national repeal and Tennessee repeal was commemorated in 2008 with a gift pack of two bottles, one for the 75th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the 70th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery. The U.S. government banned the manufacture of whiskey during World War II and a little beyond, from 1942 to 1946. Motlow resumed production of Jack Daniel's only in 1947 after good quality corn was again available. When the company was later incorporated, it was incorporated as ""Jack Daniel Distillery, Lem Motlow, Prop., Inc."" This has allowed the company to continue to include Lem Motlow, who died in 1947, in its marketing, since mentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name. Likewise, the advertisements continue to say that Lynchburg has only 361 people, though the 2000 census reports 5,740. This is allowable because the entire label was trademarked in the early 1960s when this figure was the actual population cited by the Census Bureau; changing the label would require applying for a new trademark or forfeiting trademark protection. However, the census population includes all of Moore County, as the county and city governments are consolidated. Moore County, where the Jack Daniel's distillery is located, is one of the state's many dry counties. Therefore, while it is legal to distill the product within the county, it is illegal to purchase it there. However, a state law has provided one exception: a distillery may sell one commemorative product, regardless of county statutes. Jack Daniel's now sells Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, the original No. 7 blend (in a commemorative bottle), and a seasonal blend (on rotation) at the distillery's White Rabbit Bottle Shop. Recent history. Tennessee Squires. A Tennessee Squire is a member of the Tennessee Squire Association, which was formed in 1956 to honor special friends of the Jack Daniel's distillery. Many prominent business and entertainment professionals are included among the membership, which is obtained only through recommendation of a current member. Squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as ""owner"" of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of Moore County, Tennessee. Lowering to 80 proof. Jack Daniel's black label was historically produced at 90 U.S. proof (45% alcohol by volume). The lower-end green label product was 80 proof. However, starting in 1987, the other label variations were also reduced in proof. This began with black label being initially reduced to 86 proof. (Both the black label and green label are made from the same ingredients; the difference is determined by professional tasters, who determined which of the batches would be sold under the higher-priced black label, the rest being sold under the green label.) Then, starting in 2002, all generally-available Jack Daniel's products were diluted to 80 proof (including both black label and green label). The reason stated for this was that the distillery's marketing had found that customers preferred a lower proof whiskey; this also simplified the production process. This reduction in alcohol content was condemned by ""Modern Drunkard Magazine"" and a petition was formed for drinkers who disagreed with the change.  Jack Daniel's has produced higher-proof products at times. A one-time limited run of 96 proof, the highest proof Jack Daniel's had ever bottled at that time, was bottled for the 1996 Tennessee Bicentennial in a decorative bicentennial bottle. The distillery debuted their 94 proof ""Jack Daniel's Single Barrel"" in February 1997. The ""2011 Holiday Select"" is currently the company's highest proof at 100. Sponsorships. In 2006, Jack Daniel's sponsored the Perkins Engineering team in the Australian V8 Supercar series, which continued until the end of 2008. From 2009 their sponsorship moved to the newly formed Kelly Racing team, formed from the remnants of Perkins Engineering and now defunct HSV Dealer Team. Jack Daniel's also sponsored the Richard Childress Racing 07 car (numbered after the ""Old No. 7"") in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series from 2005 to 2009.

Jack Daniel's whiskey is filtered through sugar maple charcoal in large wooden vats prior to aging, which is an extra step that is not used in making most Bourbon whiskey, and the company claims that this makes the product different from Bourbon. However, Tennessee whiskey is required to be ""a straight Bourbon Whiskey"" under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Canadian law, and there is no other legal definition of the term ""Tennessee whiskey"" (other than U.S. law governing the definition of ""whiskey"" in general). After being used for the aging of Jack Daniel's whiskey, some of the barrels are sold to McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, Louisiana, for production of Tabasco sauce and to both the Mount Gay Rum company of Barbados and Appleton Estate of Jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rums.

wikipedia-384096," Where no man has gone before  ""Where no man has gone before"" is a phrase originally made popular through its use in the title sequence of most episodes of the science fiction television series. It refers to the mission of the original starship ""Enterprise"". The complete introductory sequence, narrated by William Shatner at the beginning of every episode of ""Star Trek"" except """" and ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", is: Origin of the quotation. It has been suggested that the quotation was taken from a White House booklet published in 1958. The ""Introduction to Outer Space"", produced in an effort to garner support for a national space program in the wake of the Sputnik flight, read on its first page: The first of these factors is the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover, the thrust of curiosity that leads"" men to try to go where no one has gone before"". Most of the surface of the earth has now been explored and men now turn on the exploration of outer space as their next objective. The situation came full circle in 1989, when NASA used the ""Star Trek"" version of the quotation to title its retrospective of Project Apollo: ""Where No Man Has Gone Before: A History of Apollo Lunar Exploration Missions"". Following an early expedition to Newfoundland, Captain James Cook declared that he intended to go not only ""... ""farther than any man has been before me"", but as far as I think it is possible for a man to go"" (emphasis added). Cook's most famous ship, the ""Endeavour"", lent its name to the last-produced of the space shuttles, much as the ""Star Trek"" starship ""Enterprise"" lent its name to the program's test craft. Similar expressions have been used in literature prior to 1958. For example, H. P. Lovecraft's novella ""The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"", written in 1927 and published in 1943, includes this passage: At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great Ones. Evolution of the quotation. The phrase was first introduced into Star Trek by Samuel Peeples, who is attributed with suggesting using it as an episode name. The episode became ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", the second pilot of ""Star Trek"". The phrase itself was subsequently worked into the show's opening narration, which was written after the episode. Indeed, the introductory sequence was devised in August 1966, after several episodes had been filmed, and shortly before the series was due to debut. It is the result of the combined input of several people, including ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry and producers John D. F. Black and Bob Justman. Under their influence, Roddenberry's original narrative: This is the adventure of the United Space Ship ""Enterprise"". Assigned a five year galaxy patrol, the bold crew of the giant starship explores the excitement of strange new worlds, uncharted civilizations, and exotic people. These are its voyages and its adventures. went through several revisions before settling on the one used in the TV series. Additional usage in Star Trek. The quotation has been used numerous times by various ""Star Trek"" characters, and has been given a back-story within the ""Star Trek"" canon. The quotation is changed from ""where no ""man"" has gone before"" to ""where no ""one"" has gone before"" with the """" pilot episode ""Encounter at Farpoint"" in 1987. The quotation is engraved on the dedication plaques of the ""Enterprise""-B, ""Enterprise""-D and ""Enterprise""-E. ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"". The narration was used in the title sequence of every episode of ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"". ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"". At the end of """", Leonard Nimoy reads a version of the quotation that adds the word ""continuing"" between ""the"" and ""voyages"", replaces the words ""its five-year"" with ""her ongoing"", and adds the word ""forms"" after ""life"": Space... the Final Frontier. These are the continuing voyages of the starship ""Enterprise"". Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Five years after the release of ""The Wrath of Khan"", a version of the introduction was included in the title sequence of the TV-series '. The new version replaced ""five-year"" with ""continuing"" and the word ""man"" with the gender and species-neutral ""one"". The new introduction, narrated by Patrick Stewart (who played the ""Enterprise-Ds captain, Jean-Luc Picard), at the beginning of every episode of that series, was: Space... the Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the starship ""Enterprise"". Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. A first-season episode of 1987 of that series was named ""Where No One Has Gone Before"", the plot of which bears no connection to that of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"". The title of ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" references the ""final frontier"" mentioned in the title sequence of ""Star Trek: The Original Series"". The quotation ""where no man has gone before"" appears on the dedication plaque of the ""Enterprise""-A, and is also engraved on the base of a decorative ship's wheel found in the ship's lounge. ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"". In ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", which dealt with cross-species racism (speciecism), the word ""man"" was changed to the gender- and species-neutral ""one"" by Kirk: Captain's log, stardate 9529.1. This is the final cruise of the starship ""Enterprise"" under my command. This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew. To them and their posterity will we commit our future. They will continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...where no ""one""... has gone before. ""Star Trek: Voyager"". According to Captain Janeway in the episode """", the oath that Starfleet officers take also includes content of the meaning ""to seek out life"". ""Star Trek: Enterprise"". According to the 2001 pilot episode of the TV-series ""Enterprise"", """", the ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" title sequence mission statement of Kirk's ""Enterprise"" originates from a speech given by Zefram Cochrane at the dedication of the Warp 5 Complex in 2119: On this site, a powerful engine will be built. An engine that will someday help us to travel a hundred times faster than we can today. Imagine it. Thousands of inhabited planets at our fingertips. And we'll be able to explore those strange, new worlds. And seek out new life and new civilizations. This engine will let us go boldly where no man has gone before. The quotation was changed to use the split infinitive ""to boldly go"" at some point before 2151. At that point, it was adopted as the motto of the ""Enterprise"" and engraved on its dedication plaque with the split infinitive. The titles of two episodes also mention lines of the title sequence of the original Star Trek series: """" and ""These Are the Voyages..."". The latter is the finale of ""Enterprise"", and also closes with a voice-over of the quotation, segueing from Picard's ""Next Generation"" opening to Kirk and then closing with Jonathan Archer using the original series' gender-specific version: ""Star Trek"" (2009). At the end of the ""Star Trek"" motion picture released in 2009, Nimoy reads a revised version of his quotation from ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" that segues from the original series' opening to the phrase ""her ongoing mission"" in place of ""its five-year mission"", and closes with the ""Next Generation""'s gender-neutral version: Space... the Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the starship ""Enterprise"". Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". At the end of the 2013 film ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", the quotation is revealed to be the Captain's Oath. Kirk (Chris Pine) reads a revised version of the original series monologue with the gender-neutral ending as part of his speech at the re-christening of the ""Enterprise"" in the closing scenes of the film, ending as Kirk enters the bridge, marking the start of the famous five-year mission: ...and those words: Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship ""Enterprise"". Her five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Other uses. A 1996 book written to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Trek is called ""Star Trek: These are the Voyages..."". Outside of ""Star Trek"". The quotation has also gained popularity outside ""Star Trek"". The phrase has become a snowclone, a rhetorical device and type of word play in which one word within it is replaced while maintaining the overall structure. For example, an episode of ""Futurama"" that dealt with a character's devotion to ""Star Trek"" is named ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"", a level in the videogame """" is called ""Starbase: Where No Turtle Has Gone Before"", and an episode of ""DuckTales"" parodying ""Star Trek"" is entitled ""Where No Duck Has Gone Before"". The phrase was referred to sarcastically on the retail box of the 1987 computer game Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter, sending its hero Roger Wilco on ""His mission: to scrub dirty decks...to replace burned-out lightbulbs...TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS SWEPT THE FLOOR!"" (emphasis original) and similarly in 1992 regarding Apple's Mac 7.0 (code named ""Star Trek"") which was planned to run on the Intel chip by calling it ""the OS that boldly goes where everyone else has been"". Likewise on ""Babylon 5"", Ivanova implies that a woman is promiscuous by telling the captain, ""Congratulations. You're about to go where every man has gone before."" The split infinitive ""to boldly go"" has also been the subject of jokes. British humorist and science-fiction author Douglas Adams describes, in his series ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", the long-lost heroic age of the Galactic Empire, when bold adventurers dared ""to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before."" In ""The Physics of Star Trek"", Lawrence M. Krauss begins a list of Star Trek's ten worst errors by quoting one of his colleagues who considers that their greatest mistake is ""to split an infinitive every damn time."" "
wikipedia-365519," Victory over Japan Day  Victory over Japan Day (also known as Victory in the Pacific Day, V-J Day, or V-P Day) is a name chosen for the day on which Japan surrendered, effectively ending World War II, and subsequent anniversaries of that event. The term has been applied to both of the days on which the initial announcement of Japan's surrender was made – to the afternoon of August 15, 1945, in Japan, and, because of time zone differences, to August 14, 1945 (when it was announced in the United States and the rest of the Americas and Eastern Pacific Islands) – as well as to September 2, 1945, when the signing of the surrender document occurred, officially ending World War II. August 15 is the official V-J Day for the UK while the official US commemoration is September 2. The name, V-J Day, had been selected by the Allies after they named V-E Day for the victory in Europe. On September 2, 1945, a formal surrender ceremony was performed in Tokyo Bay, Japan, aboard the battleship USS ""Missouri"". In Japan, August 15 usually is known as the ; the official name for the day, however, is . This official name was adopted in 1982 by an ordinance issued by the Japanese government. August 15 is commemorated as Liberation Day in Korea. Surrender. Events before V-J Day. On 6 and 9 August 1945, the United States dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. On 9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. The Japanese government on 10 August communicated its intention to surrender under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but with too many conditions for the offer to be acceptable to the Allies. The news of the Japanese offer, however, was enough to begin early celebrations around the world. Allied soldiers in London danced in a conga line on Regent Street. Americans and Frenchmen in Paris paraded on the Champs-Elysées singing ""Don't Fence Me In"". American soldiers in Berlin shouted ""It's over in the Pacific"", and hoped that they would now not be transferred there to fight the Japanese. Germans stated that the Japanese were wise enough to—unlike themselves—give up in a hopeless situation, but were grateful that the atomic bomb was not ready in time to be used against them. Moscow newspapers briefly reported on the atomic bombings with no commentary of any kind. While ""Russians and foreigners alike could hardly talk about anything else"", the Soviet government refused to make any statements on the bombs' implication for politics or science. In Chungking, Chinese fired firecrackers and ""almost buried in gratitude"". In Manila, residents sang ""God Bless America"". On Okinawa, six men were killed and dozens were wounded as American soldiers ""took every weapon within reach and started firing into the sky"" to celebrate; ships sounded general quarters and fired anti-aircraft guns as their crews believed that a Kamikaze attack was occurring. On Tinian island, B-29 crews preparing for their next mission over Japan were told that it was cancelled, but that they could not celebrate because it might be rescheduled. Japan accepts the Potsdam Declaration. A little after noon in Japan Standard Time on August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration was broadcast to the Japanese people over the radio. Earlier the same day, the Japanese government had broadcast an announcement over Radio Tokyo that ""acceptance of the Potsdam Proclamation be coming soon,"" and had advised the Allies of the surrender by sending a cable to U.S. President Harry S Truman via the Swiss diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. A nation-wide broadcast by President Truman was aired at seven o'clock p.m. (daylight time in Washington, D.C.) on August 14 announcing the communication and that the formal event was scheduled for September 2. In his announcement of Japan's surrender on August 14, President Truman said that ""the proclamation of V-J Day must wait upon the formal signing of the surrender terms by Japan"". Since the European Axis Powers had surrendered three months earlier (V-E Day), ""V-J Day"" would be the official end of World War II. In Australia and most other allied nations, the name ""V-P Day"" was used from the outset. The ""Canberra Times"" of August 14, 1945, refers to VP Day celebrations, and a public holiday for VP Day was gazetted by the government in that year according to the Australian War Memorial. Public celebrations. After news of the Japanese acceptance and before Truman's announcement, Americans began celebrating ""as if joy had been rationed and saved up for the three years, eight months and seven days since Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941"", as ""Life"" magazine later reported. In Washington, D.C. a crowd attempted to break into the White House grounds as they shouted ""We want Harry!"" In San Francisco two women jumped naked into a pond at the Civic Center to soldiers' cheers. More seriously, rioting sailors looted city stores, overturned automobiles, and attacked women, leaving 11 dead and 1,000 injured. The largest crowd in the history of New York City's Times Square gathered to celebrate. The victory itself was announced by a headline on the ""zipper"" news ticker at One Times Square, which read ""*** OFFICIAL TRUMAN ANNOUNCES JAPANESE SURRENDER ***""; the six asterisks represented the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the Garment District, workers threw out cloth scraps and ticker tape, leaving a pile five inches deep on the streets. A ""coast-to-coast frenzy of kissing"" occurred, with ""Life"" publishing photographs of such kisses in Washington, Kansas City, Los Angeles, and Miami. Famous photographs. One of the best-known kisses that day appeared in ""V–J Day in Times Square"", one of the most famous photographs ever published by ""Life"". It was shot on August 14, 1945, shortly after the announcement by President Truman occurred and people began to gather in celebration. Alfred Eisenstaedt went to Times Square to take candid photographs and spotted a sailor who ""grabbed something in white. And I stood there, and they kissed. And I snapped four times."" Several people have since claimed to be the sailor and nurse. Another famous photograph is that of the Dancing Man in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, captured by a press photographer and a Movietone newsreel. The film and stills from it have taken on iconic status in Australian history and culture as a symbol of victory in the war. Japanese reaction. On August 15 and 16 some Japanese soldiers, devastated by the surrender, committed suicide. Well over 100 American prisoners of war also were murdered. In addition, many Australian and British prisoners of war were murdered in Borneo, at both Ranau and Sandakan, by the Imperial Japanese Army. At Batu Lintang camp, also in Borneo, death orders were found which proposed the murder of some 2,000 POWs and civilian internees on September 15, 1945. Ceremony aboard the USS ""Missouri"". The formal signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender took place on board the battleship USS ""Missouri"" in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, and at that time Truman declared September 2 to be the official V-J Day. Chronology. Post war: Commemoration. China. As the final official surrender of Japan was accepted aboard the battleship USS ""Missouri"" in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China, which represented China on the ""Missouri"", announced three-day holidays to celebrate ""V-J Day"", starting September 3. Starting from 1946, September 3 was celebrated as ""Victory of War of Resistance against Japan Day"" (), which evolved into the Armed Forces Day () in 1955. September 3 is recognized as ""V-J Day"" in the mainland China. There are still """"September 3"""" streets (in ) and primary schools (in ) in almost every major city in mainland China. Hong Kong. Hong Kong was handed over by Imperial Japanese Army to the Royal Navy on August 30, 1945, and resumed its pre-war status as a British dependency. Hong Kong celebrated the ""Liberation Day"" () on 30 August (later moved to the Saturday preceding the last Monday in August) annually, which was a public holiday before 1997. After the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, the celebration was moved to the third Monday in August and renamed ""Sino-Japanese War Victory Day"", the Chinese name of which is literally ""Victory of War of Resistance against Japan Day"" as in the rest of China, but this day was removed from list of public holidays in 1999. Korea. Gwangbokjeol, (literally ""Restoration of Light Day"") celebrated annually on August 15, is one of the Public holidays in South Korea. It commemorates Victory over Japan Day, which liberated Korea from Japanese rule. The day is also celebrated as a public holiday, Liberation Day, in North Korea, and is the only public holiday celebrated in both Koreas. The Netherlands. The Netherlands has one national and several regional or local remembrance services on or near to the 15th of August. The national service is at the ""Indisch monument"" in The Hague, where the Dutch (not Indonesian) victims of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies are remembered, usuallly in the presence of the head of state and the government. In total, there are about 20 services, also in the Indies remembrance center in Bronbeek in Arnhem. The about 4 million Indonesian victims of the Indonesian Holocaust during the war are seldom remembered in the Netherlands. The Japanese occputation meant the twilight of Dutch colonial rule over Indonesia. The remembrance has been tainted by revelations since of so-called war crimes and other atrocities committed by Dutch military forces during the Indonesian colonial war 1945-1948, such as the case of the so-called Rawagede massacre. Vietnam. On the day of surrender of Japan, Hồ Chí Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam. United States. Although September 2 is the designated ""V-J Day"" in the entire United States, the event is recognized as an official holiday only in the U.S. state of Rhode Island, where the holiday's official name is """"Victory Day"""", and it is observed on the second Monday of August. There were several attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to eliminate or rename the holiday on the grounds that it is discriminatory. While those all failed, the Rhode Island General Assembly did pass a resolution in 1990 ""stating that Victory Day is not a day to express satisfaction in the destruction and death caused by nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki."" It is instead commemorative of those who fought, as Rhode Island sent a significantly above-average percentage of its population into the Pacific theater. Australia. In Australia, the term ""VP Day"" is used in preference to ""VJ Day"". Amateur radio. Amateur radio operators in Australia hold the ""Remembrance Day Contest"" on the weekend nearest VP Day, August 15, remembering amateur radio operators who died during World War II and to encourage friendly participation and help improve the operating skills of participants. The contest runs for 24 hours, from 0800 UTC on the Saturday, preceded by a broadcast including a speech by a dignitary or notable Australian (such as the Prime Minister of Australia, Governor-General of Australia, or a military leader) and the reading of the names of amateur radio operators who are known to have died. It is organized by the Wireless Institute of Australia, with operators in each Australian state contacting operators in other states, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. A trophy is awarded to the state that can boast the greatest rate of participation, based on a formula including: number of operators, number of contacts made, and radio frequency bands used. World Peace Day. It was suggested in the 1960s to declare September 2, the anniversary of the end of World War II, as an international holiday to be called World Peace Day. However, when this holiday came to be first celebrated beginning in 1981, it was designated as September 21, the day the General Assembly of the United Nations begins its deliberations each year. "
wikipedia-365531," Government and binding theory  Government and binding is a theory of syntax and a phrase structure grammar (as opposed to a dependency grammar) in the tradition of transformational grammar developed principally by Noam Chomsky in the 1980s. This theory is a radical revision of his earlier theories and was later revised in ""The Minimalist Program"" (1995) and several subsequent papers, the latest being ""Three Factors in Language Design"" (2005). Although there is a large literature on government and binding theory which is not written by Chomsky, Chomsky's papers have been foundational in setting the research agenda. The name refers to two central subtheories of the theory: government, which is an abstract syntactic relation, and binding, which deals with the referents of pronouns, anaphors, and referential expressions. GB was the first theory to be based on the principles and parameters model of language, which also underlies the later developments of the Minimalist Program. Government. The main application of the government relation concerns the assignment of case. Government is defined as follows: A governs B if and only if Governors are heads of the lexical categories (V, N, A, P) and tensed I (T). A m-commands B if A does not dominate B and B does not dominate A and the first maximal projection of A dominates B. The maximal projection of a head X is XP. This means that for example in a structure like the following, A m-commands B, but B does not m-command A: In addition, barrier is defined as follows: A barrier is any node Z such that The government relation makes case assignment unambiguous. The tree diagram below illustrates how DPs are governed and assigned case by their governing heads: Another important application of the government relation constrains the occurrence and identity of traces as the Empty Category Principle requires them to be properly governed. Binding. Binding can be defined as follows: Consider the sentence ""Johni saw hisi mother."" which is diagrammed below using simple phrase structure rules. The NP ""John"" c-commands ""his"" because the first parent of the NP, S, contains ""his"". ""John"" and ""his"" are also coreferential (they refer to the same person), therefore ""John"" binds ""his"". On the other hand, in the ungrammatical sentence ""*The mother of Johni likes himselfi"", ""John"" does not c-command ""himself"", so they have no binding relationship despite the fact that they corefer.  The importance of binding is shown in the grammaticality of the following sentences: Binding is used, along with particular binding principles, to explain the ungrammaticality of those statements. The applicable rules are called Binding Principle A, Binding Principle B, and Binding Principle C.  Since ""himself"" is not c-commanded by ""John"" in sentence , Principle A is violated.  In sentence , ""him"" is bound by ""John"", violating Principle B.  In sentence , the first instance of ""John"" binds the second, violating Principle C. Note that Principles A and B refer to ""governing categories""--domains which limit the scope of binding. The definition of a governing category laid out in ""Lectures on Government and Binding"" is complex, but in most cases the governing category is essentially the minimal clause or complex NP. "
wikipedia-365537," The Marvelous Land of Oz  The Marvelous Land of Oz: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, commonly shortened to The Land of Oz, published on July 5, 1904, is the second of L. Frank Baum's books set in the Land of Oz, and the sequel to ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". This and the next thirty-four Oz books of the famous forty were illustrated by John R. Neill. The book was made into an episode of ""The Shirley Temple Show"" in 1960, and into a Canadian animated feature film of the same name in 1987. It was also adapted in comic book form by Marvel Comics, with the first issue being released in November 2009. Plot elements from ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" are included in the 1985 Disney feature film ""Return to Oz"". Plot summary. Set shortly after the events in the first book, the protagonist is a boy named Tip, who for as long as he can remember has been under the guardianship of a witch named Mombi (who is the main antagonist) in Gillikin Country. As Mombi is returning home, Tip plans to frighten her with a scarecrow he has made. Since he has no straw available, Tip instead makes a man out of wood and gives him a pumpkin for a head, naming him Jack Pumpkinhead. Mombi is not fooled, and she takes this opportunity to demonstrate the Powder of Life that she bought from another sorcerer. She sprinkles the powder on Jack, bringing him to life and startling Tip, whom Mombi catches and threatens with revenge. Tip leaves with Jack that night and steals the Powder of Life because Mombi plans to turn him into a marble statue in the morning. As they head for the Emerald City, Tip uses the Powder of Life to animate the Sawhorse so Jack can ride him (for even though Jack's wooden body does not tire, it can get worn away from all of the walking). Tip loses them as the tireless Sawhorse gallops faster and he meets with General Jinjur's all-girl Army of Revolt which is planning to overthrow the Scarecrow (who has ruled the Emerald City since the end of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz""). Marching with the Army, Tip meets again with Jack, the Sawhorse, and now the Scarecrow as they flee the Emerald City in Jinjur's wake. The companions arrive at the castle of the Tin Woodman (who now rules the Winkie Kingdom following the Wicked Witch of the West's demise) and plan to retake the Emerald City. On their way back, they are diverted by the magic of Mombi (whom Jinjur recruited to help her apprehend them), joined by the Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated Woggle-bug, and aided by the Field Mice and their queen. Jinjur and her soldiers are scared by the Field Mice out of the main palace, but they still occupy the Emerald City itself. The Scarecrow proposes manufacturing a flying beast called a Gump by which they can escape through the air. Tip animates this collection of palace furniture with the Powder of Life, and they fly off, with no control over their direction, out of Oz and land in a nest of Jackdaws with all of the birds' stolen goods. In their attempt to drive the Jackdaws from their sanctuary, the Scarecrow's straw is taken away and the Gump's wings are broken. Using the Wishing Pills, they discover with the Powder of Life, Tip and his friends escape and journey to the palace of Glinda the Good Witch. They learn from Glinda that a girl named Ozma was hidden by the Wizard of Oz long ago and that she is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City, not the Scarecrow (who did not want the job anyway). Glinda discovered that the Wizard made three visits to Mombi, but not what they were for. She therefore accompanies Tip, Jack, the Sawhorse, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Wogglebug, and the Gump back to the Emerald City to see Mombi. The witch tries to deceive them by disguising a chambermaid as herself (which fails), but manages to elude them as they search for her in the Emerald City. Just as their time runs out, the Tin Woodman plucks a rose to wear in his lapel, unaware that this is the transformed Mombi. Glinda discovers the deception right away and leads the pursuit of Mombi, who is finally caught as she tries to run across the Deadly Desert in the form of a fast and long-running Griffin (though later books state that anyone who touches the Desert is transformed into dust). Under pressure from Glinda, Mombi admits that the Wizard brought her the infant Ozma and that she used her magic to transform her into the boy Tip. At first, Tip is shocked to learn this, but Glinda and his friends help him to accept his destiny, and Mombi performs her last spell (although there is some evidence that she performed magic later on in ""The Tin Woodman of Oz""). The restored Ozma (whose physical appearance differs considerably between this book and the next, ""Ozma of Oz"") leads her friends in retaking the Emerald City. The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow, now stuffed with paper money that is worthless in Oz except as stuffing, return to Winkie Country with Jack Pumpkinhead, the Gump is disassembled at his request (though his head which was a hunting trophy that can still speak), Glinda returns to her palace in Quadling Country, the Woggle-bug remains as Ozma's advisor, and the Sawhorse becomes Ozma's personal steed. Stage elements. ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" had been transformed into a stage play, and in this work, several elements were clearly incorporated with an eye to that adaptation and to the possible adaptations of this work. ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" was dedicated to David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone, the comedians ""whose clever personations of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow have delighted thousands of children throughout the land..."" in the 1902 stage adaptation of the first Oz book. (This is referred to in the acknowledgements for Son of a Witch where Gregory Maguire acknowledges all of the cast of the stage musical, especially Joel Grey, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel.) Following the Tin Woodman's and the Scarecrow's importance to the play, a similar importance is given them this work, where neither Dorothy nor the Cowardly Lion appear. ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" was also influenced by the story and vaudevillian tone of the stage play. The character of the Wizard was in the book a good man though a bad wizard but in the play, the villain of the piece; this is reflected by the evil part he is described as having played in the back story of this work. The two armies of women, both Jinjur's and Glinda's, were so clearly intended as future chorus girls that even reviews of the book noted the similarity. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations. One early reviewer of ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" noted that some details in the book clearly appeared to be designed for stage production—in particular, ""General Jinjur and her soldiers are only shapely chorus girls."" Since the stage adaptation of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" had been a huge hit, with two companies still touring the country as the second book was published, the reviewer's suspicion was both natural and accurate: Baum wrote a stage adaptation called ""The Woggle-Bug"" that was produced in Chicago the summer of 1905. (The detail of Tip/Ozma's sex change, which can raise a range of psychological speculations in modern readers, made perfect sense in terms of early twentieth-century stage practice, since the juvenile male role of Tip would have been played by an actress as a matter of course.) The musical score was composed by Frederic Chapin, and Fred Mace played the Woggle-Bug. (Baum had wanted Fred Stone and David Montgomery to reprise their roles as the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman for the second show, but the two refused, fearing typecasting, and the characters were omitted completely from the play.) The play, unfortunately, was a flop. In addition to being part of the basis for Baum's ""The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays"", ""Land of Oz"" was the final 1910 Selig Polyscope Oz film, and has been brought to the screen several additional times. ""The Land of Oz, a Sequel to the Wizard of Oz"" was a two-reel production by the Meglin Kiddies made in 1931 and released in 1932. The film was recently recovered, but the soundtrack of the second reel is missing. ""The Wonderful Land of Oz"" (1969) was a studio-bound production from independent filmmaker Barry Mahon, which starred his son, Channy, as Tip. Mahon had previously produced nudie films; however, those films were made in New York, while ""Oz"" was made in Florida, and neither Caroline Berner (as Jinjur) nor the rest of her army were drawn from his former casts. Filmation's ""Journey Back to Oz"" (1971), recast the army of revolt with green elephants and Tip with Dorothy, but was essentially an unaccredited adaptation of this book. Elements from this novel and the following one, ""Ozma of Oz"", were incorporated into the 1985 film ""Return to Oz"" featuring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy. It is also adapted in ""Ozu no Mahōtsukai"" and the Russian animated film, ""Adventures of the Emerald City: Princess Ozma"" (2000). The story was dramatized on the TV series ""The Shirley Temple Show"" in a one-hour program, ""The Land of Oz"", broadcast on September 18, 1960, with a notable cast including Shirley Temple as Tip and Ozma, Agnes Moorehead as Mombi the witch, Sterling Holloway as Jack Pumpkinhead, Ben Blue as the Scarecrow, Gil Lamb as the Tin Woodman, and Mel Blanc as the voice of the Saw-Horse. Although the adaptation was faithful overall, much of the plot had to be sacrificed to fit the story into a one-hour time slot, and Dr. Nikidik was added to the storyline and refashioned into a lord (played by Jonathan Winters). ""The Wizard of Oz"" screenwriter Noel Langley registered an unproduced script with the U.S. Copyright Office which framed the story as the dream of an orphaned girl named ""Tippie"".  A new stage production of ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" was mounted in Minneapolis in 1981, with music composed by Richard Dworsky, a book by Thomas W. Olson, and lyrics by Gary Briggle, who originated the role of the Scarecrow. This play stayed close to the novel, eliminating some stage-difficult moments and expanding the role of Jellia Jamb. The play was premiered by The Children's Theatre Company and School of Minneapolis, and a recording of the production was made available by MCA Video. The professional and community theatre rights to the play are currently available. The 1905 ""Woggle-Bug"" script has not been published, though it has been preserved on microfilm. Its songs were published, and a collected volume was published by Hungry Tiger Press in 2001. The book was out of print for a while, but is now available again. In 1985, the Windham Classics text adventure of the Wizard of Oz adapted much of the plot of this book, however it did not include the bespelled Ozma. At the story's conclusion Tip is crowned King of Oz. Return to Oz, 1985, was partly based on this book, however Dorothy replaced Tip/Ozma, and the plot was drastically altered. In 2000, a Russian animated film was made. Elements of the 2007 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ""Tin Man"" also borrow from this book as much as it did the ""Wizard of Oz"". The protagonist, like Tip/Ozma, was a lost princess sent away from The O.Z. and magically altered to forget much of her previous existence. "
wikipedia-365553," Great Smoky Mountains National Park  Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a United States National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. It is the most visited national park in the United States. On its route from Maine to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail also passes through the center of the park. The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940. It encompasses , making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) at the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina. It was the first national park whose land and other costs were paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds. History. Before the arrival of European settlers, the region was part of the homeland of the Cherokees. Frontierspeople began settling the land in the 18th and early 19th century. In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to what is now Oklahoma. Many of the Cherokee left, but some, led by renegade warrior Tsali, hid out in the area that is now the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Some of their descendants now live in the Qualla Boundary to the south of the park. As white settlers arrived, logging grew as a major industry in the mountains, and a rail line, the Little River Railroad, was constructed in the late-19th Century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, so visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. Though Congress had authorized the park in 1926, there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to build a park. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece. Slowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographer George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park. Former Governor Ben W. Hooper of Tennessee was the principal land purchasing agent for the park, which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations made trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains. It was also a site for filming of parts of Disney's hit 1950s TV series, ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"". This park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988. A 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on September 2, 2009. Among those in attendance were all four US Senators, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Tennessee native, singer, and actress Dolly Parton also attended and performed. Geology. The majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup formation. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove. One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone. The oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrain period, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. At the end of the Paleozoic era, the ocean depostited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician period, the collision of North American and African plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. The Mesozoic era was dictated by the rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks and re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations. Natural features. Elevations in the park range from at the mouth of Abrams Creek to at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 6,000 feet (1829 m). The wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Indeed, ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches. During the most recent ice age, the northeast-to-southwest orientation of the Appalachian mountains allowed species to migrate southward along the slopes rather than finding the mountains to be a barrier. As climate warms, many northern species are now retreating upward along the slopes and withdrawing northward, while southern species are expanding. The park normally has very high humidity and precipitation, averaging from 55 inches (1,400 mm) per year in the valleys to 85 inches (2,200 mm) per year on the peaks. This is more annual rainfall than anywhere in the United States outside the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska and Hawaii. It is also generally cooler than the lower elevations below, and most of the park has a humid continental climate more comparable to locations much farther north, as opposed to the humid subtropical climate in the lowlands. The park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, , is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area. It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 10,000 species of plants and animals are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present. Park officials count more than 200 species of birds, 66 species of mammals, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500. An experimental re-introduction of elk (wapiti) into the park began in 2001. Over 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser Fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants. Attractions and activities. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. Over 9 million tourists and 11 million non-recreational visitors traveled to the park in 2003, twice as many as visited any other national park. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park. The two main visitors' centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Unlike most other national parks, there is no entry fee to the park. U.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park. The park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill at Oconaluftee. Hiking. There are 850 miles (1,368 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including seventy miles of the Appalachian Trail. Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m) — the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park. Another popular hiking trail leads to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewards nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. Both the Laurel Falls and Clingman's Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80 foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingman's Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a fifty-foot observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains. In addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. Designated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and trailheads, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for many of the campsites and all of the shelters. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary. Other activities. After hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park. Historic areas within the national park. The park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing. Electric vehicles. The National Park Service (NPS) announced in late 2001 that it would use electric vehicles (EVs) provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for a research project in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to evaluate the vehicles' performance in mountainous terrain. The NPS said the EVs will be on loan from TVA for two years and will be used by park service staff at Cades Cove and the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont to determine the benefits provided by these vehicles versus standard gasoline-fueled vehicles. Air pollution. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is considered the most polluted national park according to a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year. "
wikipedia-365558," Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated NAD+, is a coenzyme found in all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, since it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. In metabolism, NAD is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent – it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery. In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (""de novo"") from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism. NAD is considered the ""V factor"" required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae. Physical and chemical properties. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all ""dinucleotide""s, consists of two nucleotides joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The nucleotides consist of ribose rings, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons. In metabolism, the compound accepts or donates electrons in redox reactions. Such reactions (summarized in formula below) involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the reactant (R), in the form of a hydride ion (H−), and a proton (H). The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH is oxidized and NAD reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring. From the hydride electron pair, one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32 volts, which makes NADH a strong ""reducing"" agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed. In appearance, all forms of this coenzyme are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable for about a week at 4 °C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are enzyme inhibitors. Both NAD and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900 M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220 M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays – by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer. NAD and NADH also differ in their fluorescence. NADH in solution has an emission peak at 460 nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4 nanoseconds, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes can be used to measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy. Concentration and state in cells. In rat liver, the total amount of NAD and NADH is approximately 1 μmole per gram of wet weight, about 10 times the concentration of NADP and NADPH in the same cells. The actual concentration of NAD in cell cytosol is harder to measure, with recent estimates in animal cells, ranging around 0.3 mM, and approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mM in yeast. However, more than 80% of NADH fluorescence in mitochondrial is from bound form, so the concentration in solution is much lower. Data for other compartments in the cell are limited, although, in the mitochondrion the concentration of NAD is similar to that in the cytosol. This NAD is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein, since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes. The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio is an important component of what is called the ""redox state"" of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH. Biosynthesis. NAD is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a ""de novo"" pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD. ""De novo"" production. Most organisms synthesize NAD from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In a further step, some NAD is converted into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD. In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP as the source of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" and a hyperthermophilic archaeon ""Pyrococcus horikoshii"", use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor. Salvage pathways. Besides assembling NAD ""de novo"" from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. Although other precursors are known, the three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet, where the mixture of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are called vitamin B or ""niacin"". However, these compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide moiety is released from NAD in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. Indeed, the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. Cells can also take up extracellular NAD from their surroundings. Despite the presence of the ""de novo"" pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme. The salvage pathways used in microorganisms differ from those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast ""Candida glabrata"" and the bacterium ""Haemophilus influenzae"" are NAD auxotrophs – they cannot synthesize NAD – but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen ""Chlamydia trachomatis"", which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD and NADP, and must acquire these coenzymes from its host. Functions. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in metabolism. It acts as a coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases and a group of enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles. Oxidoreductase binding. The main role of NAD in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as ""dehydrogenases"" or ""reductases"", with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called ""NADH hydrogenase"" or sometimes ""coenzyme Q reductase"". When bound to a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for the dinucleotide NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one nucleotide within the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif. When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral, this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH. In some enzymes the hydrogen is transferred from above the plane of the nicotinamide ring; these are called ""class A"" oxidoreductases, whereas class B enzymes transfer the atom from below. Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species. Role in redox metabolism. The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts. Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low. Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release only a small amount of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as ""Nitrobacter"" oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH. Non-redox roles. The coenzyme NAD is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. NAD may also be added onto cellular RNA as a base modification. ADP-ribosylation involves either the addition of a single ADP-ribose moiety, in ""mono-ADP-ribosylation"", or the transferral of ADP-ribose to proteins in long branched chains, which is called ""poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation"". Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal cell signaling. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is carried out by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure. Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, as part of a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum. NAD is also consumed by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging. Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends by using NAD as a substrate to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate. Extracellular actions of NAD+. In recent years, NAD+ has also been recognized as an extracellular signaling molecule involved in cell-to-cell communication. NAD+ is released from neurons in blood vessels, urinary bladder, large intestine, from neurosecretory cells, and from brain synaptosomes, and is proposed to be a novel neurotransmitter that transmits information from nerves to effector cells in smooth muscle organs. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of its extracellular actions and their importance for human health and diseases. Pharmacology and medical uses. The enzymes that make and use NAD and NADH are important in both current pharmacology and the research into future treatments for disease. Drug design and drug development exploits NAD in three ways: as a direct target of drugs, by designing enzyme inhibitors or activators based on its structure that change the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, and by trying to inhibit NAD biosynthesis. The coenzyme NAD is not itself currently used as a treatment for any disease. However, it is potentially useful in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. Evidence on the use of NAD in neurodegeneration is mixed; studies in mice are promising, whereas a placebo-controlled clinical trial failed to show any effect. NAD is also a direct target of the drug isoniazid, which is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, an infection caused by ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"". Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. Since a large number of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved structural motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms. Because of the differences in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria. History. The coenzyme NAD was first discovered by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William Youndin in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a ""coferment"". Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions. A source of nicotinamide was identified in 1938, when Conrad Elvehjem purified niacin from liver and showed this vitamin contained nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. Then, in 1939, he provided the first strong evidence that niacin was used to synthesize NAD. In the early 1940s, Arthur Kornberg made another important contribution towards understanding NAD metabolism, by being the first to detect an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. Subsequently, in 1949, the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, in 1959, Jack Preiss and Philip Handler discovered the intermediates and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD; consequently, ""de novo"" synthesis is often called the Preiss-Handler pathway in their honor. The non-redox roles of NAD(P) are a recent discovery. The first of these functions to be identified was the use of NAD as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s. Later studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD and NADP metabolites in cell signaling – such as the action of cyclic ADP-ribose, which was discovered in 1987. The metabolism of NAD has remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest being heightened after the discovery of the NAD-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shinichiro Imai and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

wikipedia-365560," Independence Hall  Independence Hall is the centerpiece of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets. It is known primarily as the location where both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution were debated and adopted. The building was completed in 1753 as the colonial legislature (later Pennsylvania State House) for the Province of Pennsylvania. It became the principal meeting place of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1783 and was the site of the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. The building is part of Independence National Historical Park and is listed as a World Heritage Site. Preparation for construction. By the spring of 1729 the citizens of Philadelphia were petitioning to be allowed to build a state house. Two thousand pounds were set aside for the endeavor. A committee was formed composed of Thomas Lawrence, Dr. John Kearsley, and Andrew Hamilton with the responsibility of selecting a site for construction, acquiring plans for the building, and contracting a company for the purpose of construction. Hamilton was, along with William Allen, named a trustee of the purchasing and building fund and authorized to buy the land that would be the site of the state house. By October 1730 they had begun purchasing lots on Chestnut Street. By 1732, even though Hamilton had acquired the deed for Lot no.1 from surveyor David Powell, who had been paid for his work with the lot, tensions were rising among the committee members. Dr. John Kearsley and Andrew Hamilton disagreed on a number of issues concerning the state house. Kearsley, who is credited with the designs of both Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, had plans for the structure of the building but so did Hamilton. There were also differences between the two men on where the site of the building would be; Kearsley suggested High Street, now Market Street, and Hamilton wanted the site to be on Chestnut Street. Lawrence said nothing on the matter. The matter reached a point where arbitration was needed. On August 8, 1732 Andrew Hamilton brought the matter before the House. He explained Kearsley did not approve of either Hamilton’s own plans for the location of the state house or its architecture and went on to insist the House of Representatives had not agreed to these decisions. In response to this, Hamilton, on August 11, showed his plans for the state house to the House of Representatives, which they accepted. On August 14, the House sided with Hamilton, granting him full control over the project, and the site on the South side of Chestnut Street between Fifth and Sixth streets was chosen for the location of the state house. The ground was broken for construction soon after. Structure. Independence Hall was built between 1732 and 1753, designed by Edmund Woolley and Andrew Hamilton, and built by Woolley. Its construction was commissioned by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature which paid for construction as funds were available, so it was finished piecemeal. It was initially inhabited by the colonial government of Pennsylvania as its State House, from 1732 to 1799. In 1752, when Isaac Norris (statesman) was selecting a man to build the first clock for the State House, today known as Independence Hall, he chose Thomas Stretch, the son of Peter Stretch his old friend and fellow council member, to do the job.  In 1753 Thomas Stretch erected a giant clock at the building's west end that resembled a tall clock (grandfather clock). The 40-foot-tall limestone base was capped with a 14-foot wooden case surrounding the clock's face, which was carved by Samuel Harding. The giant clock was removed about 1830. The clock’s dials were mounted at the east and west ends of the main building connected by rods to the clock movement in the middle of the building. The acquisition of the original clock and bell by the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly is closely related to the acquisition of the Liberty Bell. By mid-1753, the clock had been installed in the State House attic, but six years were to elapse before Thomas Stretch received any pay for it.  During the summer of 1973 a replica of the Thomas Stretch clock was restored to Independence Hall.  The second floor Governor's Council Chamber, furnished with important examples of the era by the National Park Service, includes a musical tall case clock made by Peter Stretch, c 1740, one of the most prominent clockmakers in early America and father of Thomas Stretch. The hall is a red brick building designed in the Georgian style. It consists of a central building with belltower and steeple, attached to two smaller wings via arcaded hyphens. The highest point to the tip of the steeple spire is 168 ft, 7 inches above the ground. The two wings were demolished in 1811–1812, though these have since been reconstructed. Two smaller buildings adjoin the wings of Independence Hall: Old City Hall to the east, and Congress Hall to the west. These three buildings are together on a city block known as Independence Square, along with Philosophical Hall, the original home of the American Philosophical Society. Since its construction in the mid-20th century, to the north has been Independence Mall, which includes the current home of the Liberty Bell. Liberty Bell. The lowest chamber of the original wooden steeple was the first home of the Liberty Bell. When that steeple was removed in the 1780s the bell was lowered into the highest chamber of the brick tower, where it remained until the 1850s. The much larger Centennial Bell, created for the United States Centennial Exposition in 1876, hangs in the cupola of the 1828 steeple. The Liberty Bell, with its distinctive crack, was displayed on the ground floor of the hall from the 1850s until 1976, and is now on display across the street in the Liberty Bell Center.  Declaration of Independence and Second Continental Congress. From May 10, 1775 to 1783, the Pennsylvania State House served as the principal meeting place of the Second Continental Congress, a body of representatives from each of the thirteen British North American colonies. On June 14, 1775, delegates of the Continental Congress nominated George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House. The Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin to be the first Postmaster General of what would later become the United States Post Office Department on July 26. The United States Declaration of Independence was approved there on July 4, 1776, and the Declaration was read aloud to the public in the area now known as Independence Square. This document unified the colonies in North America who declared themselves independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained their justifications for doing so. These historic events are celebrated annually with a national holiday for U.S. Independence Day. The Congress continued to meet there until December 12, 1776, after which the Congress evacuated Philadelphia. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, the Continental Congress met in Baltimore, Maryland (December 20, 1776 to February 27, 1777). The Congress returned to Philadelphia from March 4, 1777 to September 18, 1777. In September 1777, the British Army again arrived to occupy Philadelphia, once again forcing the Continental Congress to abandon the State House. It then met in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for one day (September 27, 1777) and in York, Pennsylvania, for nine months (September 30, 1777 to June 27, 1778), where the Articles of Confederation were approved in November 1777. The Second Continental Congress again returned to Independence Hall, for its final meetings, from July 2, 1778 to March 1, 1781. Under the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation initially met in Independence Hall, from March 1, 1781 to June 21, 1783. However, as a result of the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Congress again moved from Philadelphia in June 1783 to Princeton, New Jersey, and eventually to other cities. U.S. Constitutional Convention. In September 1786, commissioners from five states met in the Annapolis Convention to discuss adjustments to the Articles of Confederation that would improve commerce. They invited state representatives to convene in Philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, the Congress of the Confederation endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787. Twelve states, Rhode Island being the exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in June 1787 at Independence Hall. The resolution calling the Convention specified its purpose as proposing amendments to the Articles, but the Convention decided to propose a rewritten Constitution. The Philadelphia Convention voted to keep deliberations secret, and to keep the Hall's windows shut throughout the hot summer. The result was the drafting of a new fundamental government design. On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was completed, and took effect on March 4, 1789, when the new Congress met for the first time in New York's Federal Hall. Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the authority to create of a federal district to serve as the national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act of 1790, which established the District of Columbia as the new federal capital. However, a representative from Pennsylvania, Robert Morris, did manage to convince Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years. The Congress moved back into Philadelphia on December 6, 1790 and met at Congress Hall, adjacent to Independence Hall until moving to Washington, D.C. in 1800. Funerary procession of Abraham Lincoln. ""Abraham Lincoln's funeral train was to take the body of the president (and the disinterred coffin of his son Willie, who had predeceased him in 1862) from Washington D.C. back to Springfield, Illinois for burial. It would essentially retrace the 1,654 mile route Mr. Lincoln had traveled as president-elect in 1861 (with the deletion of Pittsburgh and Cincinnati and the addition of Chicago). The train left Washington for Baltimore at 8:00 AM on April 21, 1865. Lincoln's funeral train (the ""Lincoln Special"") left Harrisburg on Saturday - April 22, 1865 at 11:15 AM and arrived at Philadelphia at Broad Street Station that afternoon at 4:30 PM. It was carried by hearse past a crowd of 85,000 people and was held in state in the Assembly Room in the east wing of Independence Hall. While there, it was escorted and guarded by a detail of 27 Naval and Military officers. That evening, a private viewing was arranged for honored guests of the mourners. The next day (Sunday - April 23, 1865) lines began forming at 5:00 AM. Over 300,000 mourners viewed the body - some waiting 5 hours just to see him. The Lincoln Special left Philadelphia's Kensington Station for New York City the next morning (Monday - April 24, 1865) at 4:00 A.M. Preservation. From 1802 to 1826-27, artist Charles Willson Peale housed his museum of natural history specimens (including the skeleton of a mastodon) and portraits of famous Americans, on the second floor of the Old State House and in the Assembly Room. In early 1816, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold the State House to the City of Philadelphia, with a contract signed by the governor. The deed, however, was not transferred until more than two years later. Philadelphia has owned the State House and its associated buildings and grounds since that time. In 1948, the building's interior was restored to its original appearance. Independence National Historical Park was established by the 80th U.S. Congress later that year to preserve historical sites associated with the American Revolution. Independence National Historical Park comprises a landscaped area of four city blocks, as well as outlying sites that include: Independence Square, Carpenters' Hall (meeting place of the First Continental Congress), the site of Benjamin Franklin's home, the reconstructed Graff House (where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence), City Tavern (center of Revolutionary War activities), restored period residences, and several early banks. The park also holds the Liberty Bell, Franklin's desk, a portrait gallery, gardens, and libraries. A product of extensive documentary research and archaeology by the federal government, the restoration of Independence Hall and other buildings in the park set standards for other historic preservation and stimulated rejuvenation of old Philadelphia. The site, administered by the National Park Service, is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (joining only three other U.S. man-made monuments still in use, the others being the Statue of Liberty, Pueblo de Taos, and the combined site of the University of Virginia and Monticello). Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell are now protected in a secure zone with entry at security screening buildings. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, as part of a national effort to safeguard historical monuments by the United States Department of Homeland Security, pedestrian traffic around Independence Square and part of Independence Mall was restricted by temporary bicycle barriers and park rangers. In 2006, the National Park Service proposed installing a seven-foot security fence around Independence Hall and bisecting Independence Square, a plan that met with opposition from Philadelphia city officials, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and Senator Arlen Specter. As of January 2007, the National Park Service plan was revised to eliminate the fence in favor of movable bollards and chains, and also to remove at least some of the temporary barriers to pedestrians and visitors. Legacy. Independence Hall has been used in more recent times as the staging ground for protests because of its symbolic history in support of democratic and civil rights movements. On October 26, 1918, Tomáš Masaryk proclaimed the independence of Czechoslovakia on the steps of Independence Hall. On Independence Day, July 4, 1962, President John F. Kennedy gave an address there. Independence Hall is pictured on the back of the U.S. $100 bill, as well as the bicentennial Kennedy half dollar. The Assembly Room is pictured on the reverse of the U.S. 2 dollar bill, from the original painting by John Trumbull entitled ""Declaration of Independence"". Building replicas. The building has served as a symbol of Pennsylvania, and was the basis for the Pennsylvania Pavilion of the Jamestown Exposition of 1907 in Norfolk, Virginia, and the since-demolished Pennsylvania Pavilion of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Several near-replicas or loose replicas of Independence Hall have been built elsewhere in the United States, with a majority in academic settings. Examples include Mercer University's Walter F. George School of Law in Macon, Georgia, Founders Library of Howard University, (National Historic Landmark), Baker Memorial Library of Dartmouth College, LaGuardia Hall Library of Brooklyn College, and the Mahler Student Center at Dallas Baptist University. Additional replicas include the main building of the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan (National Historic Landmark), a full-scale replica erected in 1966 at Knott's Berry Farm theme park in Buena Park, California, and Bellarmine-Jefferson High School in Burbank, California, which replicates the facade, inner staircase, and handrail. The Detroit area actually has a second replica of Independence Hall, built before the Ford Museum, the former headquarters of the Liberty Motor Car Company, at Connor and Charlevoix in Detroit, next to Chrysler's Jefferson North assembly plant. "
wikipedia-365561," Second Continental Congress  The Second Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the thirteen colonies that started meeting in the summer of 1775, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, soon after warfare in the American Revolutionary War had begun. It succeeded the First Continental Congress, which met between September 5, 1774 and October 26, 1774, also in Philadelphia. The second Congress managed the colonial war effort, and moved incrementally towards independence, adopting the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. By raising armies, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and making formal treaties, the Congress acted as the ""de facto"" national government of what became the United States. When the Second Continental Congress came together on May 10, 1775 it was, in effect, a reconvening of the First Continental Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting were in attendance at the second, and the delegates appointed the same president (Peyton Randolph) and secretary (Charles Thomson). Notable new arrivals included Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and John Hancock of Massachusetts. Within two weeks, Randolph was summoned back to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses; he was replaced in the Virginia delegation by Thomas Jefferson, who arrived several weeks later. Henry Middleton was elected as president to replace Randolph, but he declined. Hancock was elected president on May 24. Delegates from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies were present when the Second Continental Congress convened. Georgia had not participated in the First Continental Congress and did not initially send delegates to the Second Continental Congress. On May 13, 1775, Lyman Hall was admitted as a delegate from the Parish of St. John's in the Colony of Georgia, not as a delegate from the colony itself. On July 4, 1775, revolutionary Georgians held a Provincial Congress to decide how to respond to the American Revolution, and that congress decided on July 8 to send delegates to the Continental Congress. They arrived on July 20. History. Its predecessor, the First Continental Congress, had sent entreaties to the British King George III to stop the Coercive Acts and had created the Continental Association to establish a coordinated protest of the Coercive Acts; in particular, a boycott had been placed on British goods. That First Congress provided that the Second Continental Congress would meet on May 10, 1775, to plan further responses if the British government had not repealed or modified the Coercive Acts. By the time the Second Continental Congress met, the American Revolutionary War had already started with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The Congress was to take charge of the war effort. For the first few months of the struggle, the Patriots had carried on their struggle in an ad-hoc and uncoordinated manner. They had seized arsenals, driven out royal officials, and besieged the British army in the city of Boston. On June 14, 1775, the Congress voted to create the Continental Army out of the militia units around Boston and quickly appointed Congressman George Washington of Virginia as commanding general of the Continental Army. On July 6, 1775 Congress approved a Declaration of Causes outlining the rationale and necessity for taking up arms in the Thirteen Colonies."" On July 8, Congress extended the Olive Branch Petition to the British Crown as a final attempt at reconciliation. However, it was received too late to do any good. Silas Deane was sent to France as a minister (ambassador) of the Congress. American ports were reopened in defiance of the British Navigation Acts. Although it had no explicit legal authority to govern, it assumed all the functions of a national government, such as appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money (called ""Continentals""), and disbursing funds. The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests. According to one historian, commenting on the source of the Congress' power: The appointment of the delegates to both these congresses was generally by popular conventions, though in some instances by state assemblies. But in neither case can the appointing body be considered the original depositary of the power by which the delegates acted; for the conventions were either self-appointed ""committees of safety"" or hastily assembled popular gatherings, including but a small fraction of the population to be represented, and the state assemblies had no right to surrender to another body one atom of the power which had been granted to them, or to create a new power which should govern the people without their will. The source of the powers of congress is to be sought solely in the acquiescence of the people, without which every congressional resolution, with or without the benediction of popular conventions or state legislatures, would have been a mere ""brutum fulmen""; and, as the congress unquestionably exercised national powers, operating over the whole country, the conclusion is inevitable that the will of the whole people is the source of national government in the United States, even from its first imperfect appearance in the second continental congress.. ""Cyclopædia of Political Science"". New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899. Congress was moving towards declaring independence from the British Empire in 1776, but many delegates lacked the authority from their home governments to take such an action. Advocates of independence in Congress moved to have reluctant colonial governments revise instructions to their delegations, or even replace those governments which would not authorize independence. On May 10, 1776, Congress passed a resolution recommending that any colony lacking a proper (i.e. a revolutionary) government should form such. On May 15 Congress adopted a more radical preamble to this resolution, drafted by John Adams, in which it advised throwing off oaths of allegiance and suppressing the authority of the Crown in any colonial government that still derived its authority from the Crown. That same day the Virginia Convention instructed its delegation in Philadelphia to propose a resolution that called for a declaration of independence, the formation of foreign alliances, and a confederation of the states. The resolution of independence was delayed for several weeks as revolutionaries consolidated support for independence in their home governments. The records of the Continental Congress confirm that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee tabled a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent. He also urged Congress to resolve ""to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances"" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Lee argued that independence was the only way to ensure a foreign alliance, since no European monarchs would deal with America if they remained Britain's colonists. American leaders had rejected the divine right of kings in the New World, but recognized the necessity of proving their credibility in the Old World. Congress would formally adopt the resolution of independence, but only after creating three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established ""a firm league"" among the thirteen free and independent states; together these constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs. Congress finally approved the resolution of independence on July 2, 1776. Congress next turned its attention to a formal explanation of this decision, the United States Declaration of Independence, which was approved on July 4 and published soon thereafter. The Continental Congress was forced to flee Philadelphia at the end of September 1777, as British troops occupied the city. The Congress moved to York, Pennsylvania, and continued their work. After more than a year of debate, on November 15, 1777, Congress passed and sent to the states for ratification the Articles of Confederation. The issue was large states wanting a larger say, nullified by small states who feared tyranny. Jefferson's proposal for a Senate to represent the states and a House to represent the people was rejected (a similar proposal ""was"" adopted later in the United States Constitution). The small states won and each state had one vote. Congress urged the individual states to pass the Articles as quickly as possible, but it took three and a half years for all the states to ratify the Articles. Of the then thirteen states, the State Legislature of Virginia was the first to ratify the Articles, on December 16, 1777, and the State Legislature of Maryland became the last to do so, on February 2, 1781. In the meantime, the Second Continental Congress tried to lead the new country through the war with borrowed money and no taxing power. Finally, on March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation were signed by delegates of Maryland at a meeting of the Second Continental Congress, which then declared the Articles ratified. On the next day, the same congressional delegates met as the new Congress of the Confederation. As historian Edmund Burnett wrote, ""There was no new organization of any kind, not even the election of a new President."" The congress still called itself the Continental Congress. It would be the Confederation Congress that would oversee the conclusion of the American Revolution. "
wikipedia-365563," Quttinirpaaq National Park  Quttinirpaaq National Park is a Canadian national park. Located on the northeastern corner of Ellesmere Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, the most northerly extent of Canada, it is the second most northerly park on Earth after Northeast Greenland National Park. In Inuktitut, Quttinirpaaq means ""top of the world"". It was established as Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve in 1988, and the name was changed to Quttinirpaaq in 1999, when Nunavut was created, and became a national park in 2000. The reserve covers , making it the second largest park in Canada, after Wood Buffalo National Park. Landscape. The land is dominated by rock and ice. It is a polar desert with very little annual precipitation.  Much of the highlands of the park are covered in ice caps. These ice caps, and the glaciers that descend from them, date back at least to the last episode of glaciation.  The park includes Barbeau Peak, which at is the highest mountain in Nunavut. Wildlife. Some wildlife, notably lemming, arctic hare, muskox and arctic wolf live in the park, but sparse vegetation and low temperatures support only small populations. There is a very small Peary caribou population as well. During summer months, birds nest in the park including semipalmated plovers, red knots, gyrfalcon and long-tailed jaeger. Common plants include dwarf willow and arctic cotton, in addition to grasses and lichens. Plant and animal life is more concentrated in the Lake Hazen region, which has a milder climate than the surrounding ice cap covered mountains and valleys. Human history. Due to its high latitude and limited wildlife, there has never been any significant human presence within this part of Ellesmere Island. The pass from Tanquary Fiord through to Lake Hazen shows evidence of being used by arctic people since about 5000 years ago. Tent rings and food caches show that the area was visited by pre-Dorset, Dorset and Thule people, the ancestors of modern Inuit. The east and north end of the island was used as a starting point for various polar explorations. Fort Conger was an early Arctic exploration research base, and is now maintained as a Federal Heritage Building. Park. Parks Canada maintains warden stations and gravel air strips at Tanquary Fiord Airport, Lake Hazen and Ward Island. Tanquary Fiord and Lake Hazen are the main access points for tourists. Beyond these warden stations, there are no facilities within the park itself. Two backpacking routes are the route between Lake Hazen and Tanquary Fiord, and a loop around the Ad Astra and Viking ice caps, both approximately 100 km. In 2004, the park was one of nine sites added to Canada's tentative list of potential World Heritage Sites. "

In these posts, Titor made numerous predictions (a number of them vague, some quite specific) about events in the near future, starting with events in 2004. However, as of 2013, these events have not taken place; he described a drastically changed future in which the United States had broken into five smaller regions, the environment and infrastructure had been devastated by a nuclear attack, and most other world powers had been destroyed.

At the time the posts had nothing to do with future events and the name ""John Titor"" was not being used.

Early messages tended to be short. The name ""John Titor"" was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001. Eventually, a number of the threads became corrupted; but Titor's posts had been saved on subscribers' hard drives and were copied to Anomalies.net, along with new discussions of the science behind Titor's time travelling as well as his predictions. Around 2003, various websites reproduced Titor's posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted. Outline. In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa in Hillsborough County, Florida, who was assigned to a governmental time-travel project. Purportedly, Titor had been sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to ""debug"" various legacy computer programs in 2036; a reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The 5100 runs the APL and BASIC programming languages. Titor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for ""personal reasons""; ""i.e."", to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often. Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs (which remained unexplained in his time). Titor suggested that UFOs and extra-terrestrials might be travelers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines. Time machine. Titor described the time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a ""stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities"", producing a ""standard off-set Tipler sinusoid"". The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following: According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive. Titor also shared several scans of the manual of a ""C204 Time Displacement Unit"" with diagrams and schematics. He also shared some photographs of the device installed in the car. Titor further claimed that the ""Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics"" was correct. This model, better known as the many-worlds interpretation, posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision actually occurs in a separate ""universe"". Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not occur; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor's grandfather in a timeline other than his own. ...The grandfather paradox is impossible. In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett–Wheeler–Graham or multiple world theory is correct. All possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring. The chances of everything happening someplace at sometime in the superverse is 100%. Predictions. Although invoking the , whereby events from his own timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001. The most immediate of Titor's predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with ""order and rights"". He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterizes as ""having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse"" Titor refers to the exchange as N Day. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska is the nation's new capital city. Titor is vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by ""border clashes and overpopulation"", but also points to the present conflict between Arabs and Jews as not a causation, but rather a milestone that precedes a World War III. Criticism. Predictive failures. The posts were met with skepticism when they were being posted, but it was impossible to prove beforehand that the predicted events would not happen. Because Titor claimed the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was correct, effectively meaning that his travel was from a parallel universe and that things could occur differently than he had predicted, the details he presented were unfalsifiable. One of Titor's earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article occurring generally around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes being created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times) was taken by some to be evidence of this claim; but these events did not occur either. Civil war did not break out after the 2004 presidential election, nor did conflicts in 2008 and 2012 as described by Titor. Titor also unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both the 2008 and 2012 summer Olympics and the 2006 and 2010 winter Olympics have been successfully hosted. Problems with the technology. In the context of the demonstration image provided by John Titor, the laser pointer's beam being ""bent"" reveals the obvious inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well. The framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the ""beam"" is an optical fiber. Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the IBM 5100's little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was ""discovered"" as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this fact were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor's postings. This is a fairly obscure bit of trivia, however, which suggests that whoever was making the posts either was familiar with the machine specifically or else had at least a general interest in retrocomputing. Problems with the story. Numerous commentators have pointed out the extensive similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank's classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel ""Alas, Babylon"". Among other similarities, ""Alas, Babylon"" takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of ""Fort Repose"", while Titor claimed to live in the ""Fort"", formerly the University of Florida. The internal consistency of Titor's story has been questioned: for instance, in some posts he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists. (This is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies). In another posting, he speculated that today's dollar would be usable in his time, but that this would be after the reorganization of the federal government according to his own history, potentially making the currency worthless. Other problems with the story include inconsistencies in Titor's comments. His first appearance appears to have been not in 2000, but in the summer of 1998 through two faxes to Art Bell's radio program ""Coast to Coast AM"". When he began posting the online story, Y2K (January 1, 2000) had come and gone without any real problems. Yet in the 1998 faxes to Art Bell he said, ""Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting marshall law...""  In the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered ""It's too late... I just wish things didn't have to happen the way they will."" This stated mission also contradicts his other posts explaining that the multiverse theory is correct (see above), which would make changing history pointless in the context of his own timeline. Inquiry on the story. An Italian TV program (""Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza"") aired an investigation of the John Titor story on May 19, 2008. Mike Lynch, the private detective hired to investigate, found that there were no registry traces, even far in the past, of any John Titor or Titor family. In addition, he discovered that there was a company that was called the John Titor Foundation. The John Titor Foundation is a for-profit Florida LLC that was formed September 16, 2003. It had no office, and it only had a rented post box with the address PMB 237, 7862 W IRLO BRONSON HWY, KISSIMMEE FL 34747; no tapes, recordings, or evidence of Titor were found; and only Larry Haber, the CEO of the John Titor Foundation and an entertainment lawyer in Celebration, Florida, confirmed his existence. Lynch's conclusion is that John Titor may be John Rick Haber, a computer expert who is Larry Haber's brother. "
wikipedia-365583," Battle of the Saintes  The Battle of the Saintes (known to the French as the Bataille de la Dominique, or Battle of Dominica) took place over 4 days, 9 April 1782 – 12 April 1782, during the American War of Independence, and was a victory of a British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney over a French fleet under the Comte de Grasse forcing the French and Spanish to abandon a planned invasion of Jamaica. The battle is named after the Saintes (or Saints), a group of islands between Guadeloupe and Dominica in the West Indies. The French fleet defeated here by the Royal Navy was the same French fleet that had blockaded the British Army during the Siege of Yorktown. The British are sometimes credited with pioneering the tactic of ""breaking the line"" in the battle, though this is disputed. Origins. On 7 April 1782, the Comte de Grasse set out from Martinique with 35 ships of the line, including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet consisting of 12 ships of the line and 15,000 troops for the purpose of capturing the British island of Jamaica. He was pursued by Rodney with 36 ships of the line. On 9 April 1782, De Grasse sent his convoy into Guadeloupe, escorted by two fifty-gun ships (""Fier"" and ""Experiment""). There was an initial inconclusive clash during which the French got the better of the van division of the British fleet that had become separated from the centre and rear divisions. Two French ships of the line were damaged. Battle. On 12 April, De Grasse bore up with his fleet to protect a dismasted ship (""Zélé"", 74-guns) that was being chased by four British ships as he made for Guadeloupe. Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for line of battle. As the French line passed down the British line, a sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship ""Formidable"" and several other ships, including the ""Duke"" and the ""Bedford"", break through the French line, raking the ships as they did so. The resultant confusion in the French line and the severe damage to several of the French ships including De Grasse's flagship ""Ville de Paris"", of 104 guns, led eventually to De Grasse’s surrender and the retreat of many of his ships in disorder. This action split the French battle line into two. A general chase ensued. In all, four French ships were captured and one, ""César"", blew up after she was taken. The British lost 243 killed and 816 wounded, and two captains out of 36 were killed. The French loss in killed and wounded has never been stated, but of captains alone, six were killed out of 30. It is estimated that the French loss may have been as much as 2,000. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. The large number shows what a considerable force the French were willing to put ashore with the invasion of Jamaica. Of the ""Ville de Paris"" crew, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded. The magazine aboard the ""César"" exploded, killing over 400 French and 50 British sailors. Aftermath. The battle frustrated French and Spanish hopes of capturing Jamaica from the British. Rodney was created a peer with £2,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well. The battle has caused controversy ever since, for three reasons: ""Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet."" "
wikipedia-365602," Thaddeus Stevens  Thaddeus Stevens (April 4, 1792 – August 11, 1868) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s. A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against African-Americans, Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, in opposition to President Andrew Johnson. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a major part in the war's financing. Stevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a club foot, giving him a limp he kept his entire life. He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man, and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg. He interested himself in municipal affairs, and then in politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster. There, he joined the Whig Party, and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852. After a brief flirtation with the Know-Nothing Party, Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party, and was elected to Congress again in 1858. There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as war came. Stevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of President Abraham Lincoln to support his position. He guided the government's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman. As the war progressed towards a northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that African-Americans should be given a stake in the South's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen. His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans, and were not enacted. After Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens's last great battle was to secure articles of impeachment in the House against Johnson, though the Senate did not convict the President. Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded him for his egalitarian views. Early life and education. Stevens was born in Danville, Vermont, on April 4, 1792. He was the second of four children, all boys, and was named to honor the Polish general who served in the American Revolution, Thaddeus Kościuszko. His parents were Baptists who had emigrated from Massachusetts around 1786. Thaddeus was born with a clubfoot, at the time seen as a judgment from God for secret parental sin—and his older brother was born with the condition in both feet. The boys' father, Joshua Stevens, was a farmer and cobbler who struggled to make a living in Vermont. After fathering two more sons (born without disability) Joshua abandoned the children and his wife Sarah (née Morrill). The circumstances of his departure, and his subsequent fate, are uncertain; he may have died at the Battle of Oswego during the War of 1812. Sarah Stevens struggled to make a living from the farm, with the increasing aid of her sons. She was determined that her sons improve themselves, and in 1807 moved the family to the neighboring town of Peacham, where she enrolled young Thaddeus in the Caledonia Grammar School (often called the Peacham Academy). He suffered much from the taunts of his classmates for his disability. Later accounts describe him there as ""wilful, headstrong"" with ""an overwhelming burning desire to secure an education"". After graduation in 1811, Stevens enrolled in the sophomore class at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He spent his second year at Burlington College in Burlington, Vermont (today the University of Vermont) but had to return to New Hampshire when the Vermont school's campus was taken over by the federal government during the War of 1812. At Dartmouth, despite a stellar academic career, he was not elected to Phi Beta Kappa, said to have been a scarring experience for him. Stevens graduated from Dartmouth in 1814, speaking at graduation. Afterwards, he returned to Peacham and briefly taught there. Stevens also began to study law with Judge John Mattocks in Danville. In early 1815, after writing to friends in York, Pennsylvania, he moved there. Pennsylvania attorney and politician. Early years. In Pennsylvania, Stevens taught school at the York Academy and continued his studies for the bar. Local lawyers passed a resolution barring from membership anyone who had not studied law for two years full-time, a restriction likely aimed at Stevens. He found his way past this in nearby Harford County, Maryland, presenting himself and four bottles of Madeira wine to the examining board. In a story he often retold, few questions were asked but much wine drunk, and he left Bel Air the next morning with a certificate allowing him, through reciprocity, to practice law anywhere. Stevens went to Gettysburg, the seat of Adams County, where he opened an office in September 1816. Stevens knew no one in Gettysburg, and initially had little success as a lawyer. His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the constables who had arrested him. His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people, and he never lacked for business thereafter. In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt, ""Sir, I am doing my best to conceal it."" Many who memorialized Stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was involved in the first ten cases to reach the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from Adams County after he began practice, and won nine. One case he later wished he had not won was ""Butler v. Delaplaine"", in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner. In Gettysburg, Stevens also began his involvement in politics, serving six one-year terms on the borough council between 1822 and 1831 and becoming its president. He took the profits from his practice and invested them in Gettysburg real estate, becoming the largest landowner in the community by 1825, and had an interest in several iron furnaces outside of town. In addition to assets, he acquired enemies; after the death of a pregnant black woman in Gettysburg, there were anonymous letter-writers to newspapers, hinting that Stevens was culpable. The rumors dogged him for years; when one newspaper opposed to Stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as the killer, he successfully sued for libel. Anti-Masonry. Stevens's first political cause was Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; Morgan's likely killers were fellow Masons who disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828. Jackson's adherents were from the old Democratic-Republican Party and eventually became known as the Democrats. Stevens had been told by fellow attorney (and future president) James Buchanan that he could advance politically if he joined them, but Stevens could not support Jackson, out of principle. For Stevens, Anti-Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred ""cripples"" from joining. Stevens took to Anti-Masonry with enthusiasm, and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause. His biographer, Hans Trefousse, suggested that another reason for Stevens's virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair (he thereafter wore wigs, often ill-fitting), and ""the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons"". By 1829, Anti-Masonry had evolved into a political party that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania. Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement, attending the party's first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831. At the latter, he pressed the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice John McLean as the party's presidential candidate, but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt. Jackson was easily reelected; the crushing defeat (Wirt won only Vermont) caused the party to disappear in most places, though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years. In September 1833, Stevens was elected to a one-year term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as an Anti-Mason, and once in Harrisburg sought to have the body establish a committee to investigate Masonry. Stevens gained attention far beyond Pennsylvania for his oratory against Masonry, and also quickly became expert in legislative maneuvers. In 1835, a split among the Democrats put the Anti-Masons in control of the legislature. Granted subpoena powers, Stevens summoned leading state politicians who were Masons, including Governor George Wolf. The witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and when Stevens verbally abused one of them, it created a backlash that caused his own party to end the investigation. The fracas cost Stevens reelection in 1836, and the issue of Anti-Masonry died in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, Stevens remained an opponent of the order for the rest of his life. Crusader for education. Beginning with his early years in Gettysburg, Stevens advanced the cause of universal education. At the time, no state outside New England had free public education for all. In Pennsylvania, there was free education in Philadelphia, but elsewhere in the state, those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a pauper's oath. Stevens opened his extensive private library to the public and gave up his presidency of the borough council, believing his service on the school board more important. In 1825, he was elected by the voters of Adams County as a trustee of Gettysburg Academy. As the school was failing, Stevens got county voters to agree to pay its debt, allowing it to be sold as a Lutheran seminary. It was granted the right to award college degrees in 1831 as Pennsylvania College, and in 1921 became Gettysburg College. Stevens gave the school land upon which a building could be raised and for many years served as a trustee. In April 1834, Stevens, working with Governor Wolf, guided through the legislature an act to allow districts across the state to vote on whether to have public schools and the taxes to pay for them. Gettysburg's district voted in favor, and also elected Stevens as a school director, where he served until 1839. Tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal. The result was a repeal bill that easily passed the Senate. It was widely believed the bill would also pass the House, and be enacted despite opposition by Stevens. When he rose to speak on April 11, 1835, he defended the new educational system, stating that it would actually save money, and demonstrated how. He stated opponents were seeking to separate the poor into a lower caste then themselves, and accused the rich of greed and failure to empathize with the poor. Stevens argued, ""Build not your monuments of brass or marble, but make them of everliving mind!"" The repeal bill was defeated; Stevens was given wide credit. Trefousse suggested that the victory was not due to Stevens's eloquence, but due to his influence, combined with that of Governor Wolf. Political change; move to Lancaster. In 1838, Stevens ran again for the legislature. He hoped that if the remaining Anti-Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority, he could be elected to the United States Senate, whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures. A campaign dirty even by the standards of the times followed. The result was a Democrat elected as governor, Whig control of the state Senate, and the state House in dispute, with a number of seats from Philadelphia in question, though Stevens won his seat in Adams County. Stevens sought to have those Philadelphia Democrats excluded, which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as senator. Amid rioting in Harrisburg—later known as the ""Buckshot War""—Stevens's ploy backfired, with the Democrats taking control of the House. Stevens remained in the legislature most years through 1842, but the episode cost him much of his political influence, as the Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party. Nevertheless, he supported the pro-business and pro-development Whig stances. He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election, former general William Henry Harrison. Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected, he received none, and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office, to be succeeded by John Tyler, a southerner hostile to Stevens's stances on slavery. Although Stevens was the most successful lawyer in Gettysburg, he had accrued debt due to his business interests. Refusing to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws, he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality in order to gain the money to pay his obligations. In 1842, Stevens moved his home and practice to the city of Lancaster. He knew Lancaster County was an Anti-Mason and Whig stronghold, which ensured that he retained a political base. Within a short period, he was earning more than any other Lancaster attorney; by 1848 he had reduced his debts to $30,000, and paid them off soon after. It was in Lancaster that he engaged the services of Lydia Hamilton Smith, a mulatto housekeeper who remained with him the rest of his life. Abolitionist and prewar congressman. Evolution of views. In the 1830s, few sought the immediate eradication of slavery. The abolitionist movement was young and only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight. Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current in 1942, suggested it was out of ambition; Fawn Brodie, in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out of identification with the downtrodden, based on his handicap. Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the ""Butler"" case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career. At the Pennsylvania constitutional convention in 1837, Stevens, who was a delegate, fought against the disenfranchisement of African-Americans, though he was willing to support a minimum property requirement for all voters. According to historian Eric Foner, ""When Stevens refused to sign the 1837 constitution because of its voting provision, he announced his commitment to a non-racial definition of American citizenship to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life"". After he moved to Lancaster, a city not far from the Mason-Dixon Line, he became active in the Underground Railroad, not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves, but coordinating the movements of those seeking freedom. A 2003 renovation at his former home in Lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern, attached to the main building by a concealed tunnel, in which escaped slaves hid. Stevens, until the outbreak of the Civil War, took the public position that he supported slavery's end and opposed its expansion. Nevertheless, he would not seek to disturb it in the states where it existed as the Constitution protected their internal affairs from outside interference. He also supported slaveowning Whig candidates for president: Henry Clay in 1844 and Zachary Taylor in 1848. First tenure in Congress. In 1848, Stevens ran for election to Congress from Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district. There was opposition to him at the Whig convention. Some delegates felt that because Stevens had been late to join the party, he should not receive the nomination; others disliked his stance on slavery. He narrowly won the nomination. In a strong year for Whigs nationally, Taylor was chosen as president and Stevens was elected to Congress. When Congress convened in December 1849, Stevens took his seat, joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as Salmon P. Chase. Stevens spoke out against the Compromise of 1850, crafted by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, that gave victories to both North and South, but would allow for some of the territories recently gained from Mexico to become slave states. In June, as the debates continued, he stated, ""This word 'compromise' when applied to human rights and constitutional rights I abhor"". Nevertheless, the pieces of legislation that made up the Compromise passed, including the Fugitive Slave Act, which Stevens found particularly offensive. Although many Americans hoped that the Compromise would bring sectional peace, Stevens warned that it would be ""the fruitful mother of future rebellion, disunion, and civil war"". Stevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850, even though his stance caused him problems among pro-Compromise Whigs. In 1851, Stevens was one of the defense lawyers in the trial of 38 African-Americans and three others in federal court in Philadelphia on treason charges. The defendants had been implicated in the so-called Christiana Riot, in which an attempt to enforce a Fugitive Slave Act warrant had resulted in the killing of the slaveowner. Justice Robert Grier of the U.S. Supreme Court, as circuit justice, tried the case, and instructed the jury to acquit on the grounds that though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot, they were not charged with that, and were not guilty of treason. The well-publicized incident (and others like it) increased polarization over the issue of slavery and made Stevens a prominent face of northern abolitionism. Despite this trend, Stevens suffered political problems. He left the Whig caucus in December 1851, when his colleagues would not join him in seeking the repeal of the offensive elements of the Compromise, though he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president, General Winfield Scott. His political opposition, and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial, made him unlikely to win renomination, and he sought only to pick his successor. His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination. Know-Nothing and Republican. Out of office, Stevens concentrated on the practice of law in Lancaster, remaining one of the leading attorneys in the state. He stayed active in politics, and in 1854, to gain more votes for the anti-slavery movement, he joined the nativist Know Nothing Party. The members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing), and Stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar rules of secrecy as the Masons. In 1855, Stevens joined the new Republican Party. Other former Whigs who were anti-slavery joined as well, including William H. Seward of New York, Charles E. Sumner of Massachusetts, and Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. Stevens was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention, where he supported Justice McLean, as he had in 1832. The convention, however, nominated John C. Frémont, whom Stevens actively supported in the race against his fellow Lancastrian, the Democratic candidate James Buchanan. Nonetheless, Pennsylvania helped elect Buchanan. Stevens returned to the practice of law, but by 1858, with the President and his party unpopular and the nation torn by such controversies as the Dred Scott decision, Stevens saw an opportunity to return to Congress. As the Republican nominee, he was easily elected. Democratic papers were appalled. One banner headline read, ""Niggerism Triumphant"". 1860 election; secession crisis. Stevens took his seat in Congress in December 1859, only days after the hanging of John Brown, who had attacked the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry hoping to cause a slave insurrection. Stevens opposed Brown's violent actions at the time, though later, he was more approving. Sectional tensions spilled over into the House, which proved unable to elect a Speaker for eight weeks. Stevens was active in the bitter flow of invective from both sides; at one point, Mississippi Congressman William Barksdale drew a knife on him, though no blood was spilled. With the Democrats unable to agree on a single presidential candidate, the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago became crucial, as the nominee would be in a favorable position to become president. Prominent figures in the party such as Seward and Lincoln sought the nomination. Stevens continued to support the 75-year-old Justice McLean. On the third ballot, most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln, beginning a stampede that won the Illinoisan the nomination. As the Democrats put up no candidate in his district, Stevens was assured of reelection to the House, and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania. Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College. The President-elect's known opposition to slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states, a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign. Congress convened in December 1860, with several of the southern states already pledging to secede. Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners, such as the Crittenden Compromise, which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment. He stated, in a remark widely quoted both North and South, that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln's election, he would see ""this Government crumble into a thousand atoms"", and that the forces of the United States would crush any rebellion. Despite Stevens's protests, the lame-duck Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes, allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands. Many, even in the abolition movement, were content to let it be so, and to let the South go its own way. Stevens did not agree, and the congressman was ""undoubtedly pleased"" by Lincoln's statement in his first inaugural address on March 4, 1861 that he would ""hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government"". Civil War. Slavery. When war began in April 1861, Stevens argued that the southerners were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force. He also believed that the South had placed itself beyond the protection of the Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republicans (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. This position gave him power over the House's agenda. In July 1861, Stevens secured the passage of an act to confiscate the property, including slaves, of certain rebels. In November 1861, Stevens introduced a resolution to emancipate all slaves; it was defeated. However legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories. By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border States, with the masters compensated by the federal government. Stevens and other radicals were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, ""Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon"". In April 1862, Stevens wrote to a friend, ""As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody."" The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: ""Stevens, Sumner and Senator Henry Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour issue one has not yet come."" The President stated that if it came to a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them ""the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with"" but ""with their faces ... set Zionwards"". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them ""flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community"". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. During the Confederate incursion into the North in mid-1863 that culminated in the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North had done the same to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond; Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states. Stevens pushed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure, did not apply to all slaves, and might be reversed by peacetime courts; an amendment would be slavery's end. The Thirteenth Amendment—which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime—easily passed the Senate, but failed in the House in June; fears that it might not pass delayed a renewed attempt there. Lincoln campaigned aggressively for the amendment after his re-election in 1864, and Stevens described his December annual message to Congress as ""the most important and best message that has been communicated to Congress for the last 60 years"". Stevens closed the debate on the amendment on January 13, 1865. Illinois Representative Isaac Arnold wrote: ""distinguished soldiers and citizens filled every available seat, to hear the eloquent old man speak on a measure that was to consummate the warfare of forty years against slavery"". The amendment passed narrowly after heavy pressure exerted by Lincoln himself, along with offers of political appointments from the ""Seward lobby"". Allegations of bribery were made by Democrats; Stevens stated ""the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America."" The amendment was declared ratified on December 18, 1865. Stevens continued to push for a broad interpretation of it that included economic justice in addition to the formal end of slavery. After passing the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress debated the economic rights of the freedmen. Urged on by Stevens, it voted to authorize the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, with a mandate (though no funding) to set up schools and to distribute ""not more than forty acres"" ha of confiscated Confederate land to each family of freed slaves. Financing the war. Stevens worked closely with Lincoln administration officials on legislation to finance the war. Within a day of his appointment as Ways and Means chairman, he had reported a bill for a war loan. Legislation to pay the soldiers Lincoln had already called into service and to allow the administration to borrow to prosecute the war quickly followed. These acts and more were pushed through the House by Stevens. To defeat the delaying tactics of Copperhead opponents, he had the House set debate limits as short as half a minute. Stevens played a major part in the passage of the Legal Tender Act of 1862, when for the first time the United States issued currency backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency issues to the amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century, until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Although the Legal Tender legislation allowed for the payment of government obligations in paper money, Stevens was unable to get the Senate to agree that interest on the national debt should be paid with greenbacks. As the value of paper money dropped, Stevens railed against gold speculators, and in June 1864 after consultation with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposed what became known as the Gold Bill—to abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery. It passed Congress in June; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster. Under heavy pressure from the business community, Congress repealed the bill on July 1, twelve days after its passage. Stevens was unrepentant even as the value of paper currency recovered in late 1864 amid the expectation of Union victory, proposing legislation to make paying a premium in greenbacks for an amount in gold coin a criminal offense. It did not pass. Reconstruction. Problem of reconstructing the South. As Congress debated how the U.S. would be organized after the war, the status of freed slaves and former Confederates remained undetermined.﻿ Stevens stated that what was needed was a ""radical reorganization of southern institutions, habits, and manners"". Stevens, Sumner and other radicals argued that the southern states should be treated like conquered provinces, without constitutional rights. Lincoln, on the contrary, said that only individuals, not states, had rebelled. In July 1864, Stevens pushed Lincoln to sign the Wade–Davis Bill, which required at least half of prewar voters to sign an oath of loyalty for a state to gain readmission. Lincoln, who advocated his more lenient ten percent plan, pocket vetoed it. Stevens reluctantly voted for Lincoln at the convention of the National Union Party, a coalition of Republicans and War Democrats. He would have preferred to vote for the sitting vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, as Lincoln's running mate in 1864, but his delegation voted to cast the state's ballots for the administration's favored candidate, Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor. Stevens was disgusted at Johnson's nomination, complaining, ""can't you get a candidate for Vice-President without going down into a damned rebel province for one?"" Stevens campaigned for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket; it was elected, as was Stevens for another term in the House. When in January 1865 Congress learned that Lincoln had attempted peace talks with Confederate leaders, an outraged Stevens declared that if the American electorate could vote again, they would elect General Benjamin Butler instead of Lincoln. Presidential Reconstruction. Before leaving town after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln to press the South hard militarily, though the war was ending. Lincoln replied, ""Stevens, this is a pretty big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him. We must take care that he does not slip away from us."" Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with ""a homely metaphor but no real certainty of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy"". On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat. In May 1865, Andrew Johnson began what came to be known as ""Presidential Reconstruction"": recognizing a provisional government of Virginia led by Francis Harrison Pierpont, calling for other former rebel states to organize constitutional conventions, declaring amnesty for many southerners, and issuing individual pardons to even more. Johnson did not push the states to protect the rights of freed slaves, and immediately began to counteract the land reform policies of the Freedmen's Bureau. These actions outraged Stevens and others who took his view. The radicals saw that freedmen in the South risked losing the economic and political liberty necessary to sustain emancipation from slavery. They began to call for universal male suffrage and continued their demands for land reform. Stevens wrote to Johnson that his policies were gravely damaging the country and that he should call a special session of Congress, which was not scheduled to meet until December. When his communications were ignored, Stevens began to discuss with other radicals how to prevail over Johnson when the two houses convened. Congress has the constitutional power to be the judge of whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated. He argued that the states should not be readmitted as thereafter Congress would lack the power to force race reform. In September, Stevens gave a widely reprinted speech in Lancaster in which he set forth what he wanted for the South. He proposed that the government confiscate the estates of the largest 70,000 landholders there, those who owned more than . Much of this property he wanted distributed in plots of to the freedmen; other lands would go to reward loyalists in both North and South, or to meet government obligations. He warned that under the President's plan, the southern states would send rebels to Congress who would join with northern Democrats and Johnson to govern the nation and perhaps undo emancipation. Through late 1865, the southern states held white-only balloting and in congressional elections, chose many former rebels, most prominently Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, voted as senator by the Georgia Legislature. Violence against African-Americans was common and unpunished in the South; the new legislatures enacted Black Codes, depriving the freedmen of most civil rights. These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against him. Congressional Reconstruction. By this time, Stevens was in his seventies and in poor health; he was carried everywhere in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the Clerk of the House that when the roll was called, the names of the southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio's Rutherford B. Hayes, described Stevens, ""He is radical throughout, except, I am told, he don't believe in hanging. He is leader."" As the responsibilities of the Ways and Means chairman had been divided, Stevens took the post of chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, retaining control over the House's agenda. Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment. He proposed and then co-chaired the Joint Committee on Reconstruction with Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden. This body, also called the Committee of Fifteen, investigated conditions in the South. It heard not only of the violence against African-Americans, but against Union loyalists, and against what southerners termed ""carpetbaggers"", northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace. Stevens declared: that ""our loyal brethren at the South, whether they be black or white"" required urgent protection ""from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them."" The Committee of Fifteen began consideration of what would become the Fourteenth Amendment. Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865, before the Committee had even formed. In January 1866, a subcommittee including Stevens and John Bingham proposed two amendments: one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights, privileges, and protections for all citizens; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws. Stevens believed that the Declaration of Independence and Organic Acts already bound the federal government to these principles, but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the State level. The resolution providing for what would become the Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress; during the closing debate, Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans. Nevertheless, stating that he lived among men, not angels, he supported the passage of the compromise amendment. Still, Stevens told the House: ""Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to African-American than the immediate right to vote."" When Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the Freedman's Bureau, Stevens called the Bill a ""robbery"" because it did not include sufficient provisions for land reform or protect the property of refugees given them by the military occupation of the South. Johnson vetoed the Bill anyway, calling the Freedmen's Bureau unconstitutional, and decrying its cost—Congress had never purchased land, established schools, or provided financial help for ""our own people"". Congress was unable to override Johnson's veto in February, but five months later passed a . Stevens criticized the passage of the Southern Homestead Act of 1866 arguing that the low-quality land it made available would not drive real economic growth for black families. Congress overrode a Johnson veto to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also introduced by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government. After Congress adjourned in July, the campaigning for the fall elections began. Johnson embarked on a trip by rail, dubbed the ""Swing Around the Circle"", that won him few supporters; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified. He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour. Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South, his hand strengthened by violence in Memphis and New Orleans, where African-Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs, including the police. Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents; Republicans would have a two-thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress. Radical Reconstruction. In January 1867, Stevens introduced legislation to divide the South into five districts, each commanded by an army general empowered to override civil authorities. These military officers were to supervise elections with all males, of whatever race, entitled to vote, except for those who could not take an oath of past loyalty—most white southerners could not. The states were to write new constitutions (subject to approval by Congress) and hold elections for state officials. Only if a state ratified the Fourteenth Amendment would its delegation be seated in Congress. The system gave power to a Republican coalitions of freedmen (mobilized by the Union League), carpetbaggers and co-operative southerners (the last dubbed scalawags by indignant ex-rebels) in most southern states. These states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in mid-1868. Stevens introduced a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials who had received Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, and most of the officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself. Stevens steered a bill to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia through the House; the Senate passed it in 1867, and it was enacted over Johnson's veto. Congress was downsizing the Army for peacetime; Stevens offered an amendment, which became part of the bill as enacted, to have two regiments of African-American cavalry. His solicitude for African-Americans extended to the Native American; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place reservations under state law, noting that the native people had often been abused by the states. An expansionist, he supported the railroads. Although he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs, he also sought unsuccessfully to get a bill passed to protect labor with an eight-hour day in the District of Columbia. Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises; it did not pass. Impeaching the President. The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, was not as aggressive in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the President should be impeached. Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president ""pro tempore"", next in line to the presidency in the absence of a vice president. Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of ""Das Kapital"". Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into. Most of Johnson's Cabinet supported him but Secretary of War Stanton did not, and with the General of the Army, war hero Ulysses S. Grant, worked to undermine Johnson's Reconstruction policies. Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed, sometimes over his veto, though he often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent. After Stanton refused Johnson's request that he resign in August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton, as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act, and made General Grant interim Secretary of War. Republicans campaigned in that year's election on the issue of African-American suffrage, but were met with a voter surge towards the Democrats, who opposed it. Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake, voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in the legislature, meaning that Wade, whose term was due to expire in 1869, would not be reelected. When Congress met again in December, although the Judiciary Committee voted 5-4 for impeachment, the House voted against it. On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton. Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place. Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his place—though Stanton barricaded himself in his office. These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, ""Didn't I tell you so? What good did your moderation do you? If you don't kill the beast, it will kill you."" Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health he was unable to complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud. He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people. He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but ""this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves."" The House voted 126–47 to impeach the President. Stevens led the delegation of House members sent the following day to inform the Senate of the impeachment, though he had to be carried to its doors by his bearers. Elected to the committee charged with drafting articles of impeachment, his illness limited his involvement. Nevertheless, dissatisfied with the committee's proposed articles, Stevens suggested another, that would become Article XI. This grounded the various accusations in statements Johnson had made denying the legitimacy of Congress due to the exclusion of the southern states, and stated that Johnson had tried to disobey the Reconstruction Acts. Stevens was one of the managers, or prosecutors, elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial. Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3, when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned (the President would appear only by his counsel, or defense managers), he was there ten days later when the summons was returnable. The ""New York Herald"" described him as having a ""face of corpselike color, and rigidly twitching lips ... a strange and unearthly apparition—a reclused remonstrance from the tomb ... the very embodiment of fanaticism, without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy ... the avenging Nemesis of his party—the sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation"". Increasingly ill, Stevens took little part in the impeachment trial, at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler. Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and terrapin, port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27. As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally he allowed Butler to read the second half of his speech for him. Stevens focused on Article XI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The President, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, ""and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have ... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance. How can he escape the just vengeance of the law?"" Most radicals were confident that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office. Stevens, however, was never certain of the result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, and he had no great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote. All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of the articles. Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired Article XI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator Edmund Ross, whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal. This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the President would not be convicted on that article. The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 against. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days. Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair—one observer described him as ""black with rage and disappointment""—and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, ""The country is going to the devil!"" Final months and death. During the recess of the impeachment court, the Republicans met in convention in Chicago and nominated Grant for president. Stevens did not attend, and was dismayed by the exclusion of African-American suffrage from the party platform as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party. When the Senate returned to session, it voted down Articles II and III by the same 35–19 margin as before, and Chase declared the President acquitted. Stevens did not give up on the idea of removing Johnson; in July, he proffered several more impeachment articles (the House refused to adopt them). He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts so as to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson. It was defeated; the ""Herald"" stated, ""It is lamentable to see this old man, with one foot in the grave, pursuing the President with such vindictiveness."" Nevertheless, Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868. Brodie suggested that Stevens's hatred of Johnson was the only thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan. Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, Alexander McClure, ""My life has been a failure. With all this great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic."", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania. When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, ""I have no history. My life-long regret is that I have lived so long and so uselessly."" Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that ""man still is vile. But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage."" When Congress adjourned in late July, Stevens remained in Washington, too ill to return to Pennsylvania. Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments, from swollen feet, and from dropsy. By early August, he was unable to leave the house. He still received some visitors though, and correctly predicted to his friend and former student Simon Stevens (no relation) that Grant would win the election. On the afternoon of August 11, his doctor warned that he would probably not last through the night. His longtime housekeeper and companion, Lydia Hamilton Smith, his nephews, and friends gathered by him. Two black preachers came to pray by him, telling him that he had the prayers of all their people. He sucked on ice to try to sooth the pain; his last words were a request for more of it. Thaddeus Stevens died on the night of August 11, 1868, as the old day departed. President Johnson issued no statement upon the death of his enemy. Newspaper reaction was generally along partisan lines, though sometimes mixed. The Detroit ""Post"" stated that ""if to die crowned with noble laurels, and ... secure of the respect of the world ... is an end worthy the ambition of a well spent life, then the veteran Radical may lie down with the noblest of the fathers to a well contented sleep"". ""The New York Times"" stated that Stevens had ""discerned the expediency of emancipation, and urged it long before Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation"" but that after the war, ""on the subject of Reconstruction, then, Mr. Stevens must be deemed the Evil Genius of the Republican Party. The Louisiana ""Planter's Banner"" exulted, ""The prayers of the righteous have at last removed the Congressional curse! May ... the fires of his new furnace never go out!"" Stevens's body was conveyed from his house to the Capitol by white and African-American pallbearers together. Thousands of mourners, of both races, filed past his casket as he lay in state in the Rotunda; Stevens was the third man, after Clay and Lincoln, to receive that honor. African-American soldiers constituted the guard of honor. After a service there, his body was taken by funeral train to Lancaster, a city draped in black for the funeral. Stevens was laid to rest in Shreiner's Cemetery (today the Shreiner-Concord Cemetery); it allowed burial of people of all races, although at the time of Stevens's interment, only one African-American was buried there. The people of his district posthumously renominated him to Congress, and elected his former student, Oliver J. Dickey to succeed him. When Congress convened in December 1868, there were a number of speeches in tribute to Stevens; they were afterwards collected in book form. Personal life and sites. Personal life. Stevens never married, though there were rumors about his 20-year relationship (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob and at least one of her sons were much darker than she was. It is uncertain if the Stevens-Smith relationship was romantic. The Democratic press, especially in the South, assumed so, and when he brought Mrs. Smith to Washington in 1859, where she managed his household, that did nothing to stop their insinuations. In the one brief surviving letter from Stevens to her, Stevens addresses her as Mrs. Lydia Smith. Stevens insisted that his nieces and nephews refer to her as Mrs. Smith, deference towards an African-American servant almost unheard of at that time. They do so in surviving letters, warmly, asking Stevens to see that she comes with him next time he visits. As evidence that their relationship was sexual, Brodie pointed to an 1868 letter in which Stevens compares himself to Richard M. Johnson, vice president under Martin Van Buren, who lived openly with a series of African-American slave mistresses. Johnson was elected even though this became known during the 1836 campaign, a fact that Stevens notes, and expresses his bitterness about his inability to gain election by the legislature to the Senate, or to secure a Cabinet position. When Stevens died, Smith was at his bedside, along with his friend Simon Stevens, nephew Thaddeus Stevens Jr., two African-American nuns, and several other individuals. Under Stevens's will, Smith was allowed to choose between a lump sum of $5,000 or a $500 annual allowance; she was also allowed to take any furniture in his house. With the inheritance, she purchased Stevens's house, where she had lived for many years. A Roman Catholic, she chose to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, not near Stevens, although she left money for the upkeep of his grave. Stevens had taken custody of his two young nephews, Thaddeus (often called ""Thaddeus Jr."") and Alanson Joshua Stevens after their parents died in Vermont. Alanson was sent to work at Stevens's business, Caledonia Forge, Thaddeus Jr. was expelled from Dartmouth, though he subsequently graduated and was taken into his uncle's law practice. Alanson during the Civil War rose to be commanding captain of a Pennsylvania Volunteers field artillery unit and was killed in action at Chickamauga. After Alanson's death, his uncle used his influence to have Thaddeus Jr. made provost marshal of Lancaster. Related sites. Buildings associated with Stevens and with Smith in Lancaster are being renovated by the local historical society, LancasterHistory.org. In his will, Stevens made a number of bequests, with much of his estate to his nephew Thaddeus Jr., on condition that he refrain from alcohol. If he did not, that bequest would go to establish an orphanage in Lancaster, to be open to all races and nationalities without discrimination. A legal fight over his estate ensued, and it was not until 1894 that the courts settled the matter, awarding $50,000 to found the orphanage. The school today is the Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, in Lancaster. Among a number of other schools named for Stevens, the Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School in Washington, D.C. was founded in 1868 as the first school built for African-American children there. It was segregated for the first 86 years of its existence. In 1977, Amy Carter, daughter of President Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, was enrolled there, the first child of a sitting president to attend public school in almost 70 years. Historical and popular view. As Stevens biographer Richard N. Current put it, ""to find out what really made the man go, the historian would need the combined aid of two experts from outside the profession—a psychoanalyst and a spiritualist."" The historical view of Thaddeus Stevens has fluctuated widely in the near century and a half since his death, generally in a manner inverse to that of Andrew Johnson. Early biographical works on Stevens were composed by men who knew him, and reflected their prejudices. Biographies at the turn of the century, such as that by Samuel McCall in 1899 and James Albert Woodburn in 1913, presented Stevens favorably, as a sincere man, motivated by principle. Early African-American historian W.E.B. DuBois called Stevens ""a leader of the common people"" and ""a stern believer in democracy, both in politics and in industry"". Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James Ford Rhodes opined that though Stevens had a ""profound sympathy"" towards the African-American, ""coming straight from the heart"", he also showed ""virulence toward the South"" and was ""bitter and vindictive"". This view of a vengeful Stevens originated during Reconstruction, and persisted well into the 20th century. With the advent of the Dunning School's view of Reconstruction after 1900, Stevens continued to be viewed negatively, and generally as motivated by hatred. These historians, led by William Dunning, taught that Reconstruction had been an opportunity for radical politicians, motivated by ill-will towards the South, to destroy what little of southern life and dignity that the war had left. Dunning himself deemed Stevens ""truculent, vindictive, and cynical"". Lloyd Paul Stryker, who wrote a highly-favorable 1929 biography of Johnson, labeled Stevens as a ""horrible old man ... craftily preparing to strangle the bleeding, broken body of the South"" and who thought it would be ""a beautiful thing"" to see ""the white men, especially the white women of the South, writhing under negro domination"". In 1915, D.W. Griffith's film ""The Birth of a Nation"" was released, containing the villainous character, Congressman Austin Stoneman, who resembled Stevens down to the ill-fitting wig, limp, and African-American lover (named Lydia Brown). This popular treatment reinforced and reinvigorated public prejudices towards Stevens. According to Foner, ""as historians exalted the magnanimity of Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, Stevens came to symbolize Northern malice, revenge, and irrational hatred of the South."" Historians who penned biographies of Stevens in the late 1930s sought to move away from this perspective, seeking to rehabilitate him and his political career. Thomas F. Woodley wrote of Stevens in 1937, and while his work shows admiration of Stevens, he attributed Stevens's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. Alphonse Miller, in his 1939 biography, found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly. Richard Current's 1942 work reflected current Beardian historiography which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions, and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens's egalitarian beliefs he actually promoted inequality, for ""none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth"". With Ralph Korngold's 1955 biography of Stevens, the neoabolitionist school of historians began to consider the former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-American after the war were ""rapscallion carpetbaggers"" defeated by ""saintly redeemers"". Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights, and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. They took the view that the African-American was central to Reconstruction, and the only things wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough, and stopped too soon. Brodie's 1959 biography of Stevens was of this school. Controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography, it found that Stevens was a ""consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed"", and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development. According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing. Scholars who followed Brodie continued to chip away at the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator, who dominated Congress to get his way. In 1960, Eric McKitrick deemed Stevens ""a picturesque and adroit politician, but a very limited one"" whose career was ""a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which, one after another, kept blowing up in his face"". From the mid-1970s onward, Foner argued that Stevens's role was in staking out radical position, but events, not Stevens, caused the Republicans to support him. Michael Les Benedict in 1974 suggested that Stevens's reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence. In 1989, Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means, Stevens was ""less than complete master"" of his committee. Historian Hans Trefousse stated in a 1969 study of the Radical Republicans that Stevens's ""one abiding passion was equality"". In 1991, he noted that Stevens ""was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. dominated the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail."" In his 1997 biography of Stevens, though, he took a position similar to McKitrick's: that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure, with his influence often limited by his extremism. Trefousse believed that Brodie went too far both in deeming Stevens's clubfoot responsible for so much about him, and in giving full credence to the Stevens-Smith relationship: both those things cannot now be determined with certainty. Steven Spielberg's 2012 film ""Lincoln"", in which Stevens was played by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public interest in Stevens. Jones's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals"" on which scriptwriter Tony Kushner based the film's screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, ""he's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love him too much to say so. He's not a leader, he's a liability, one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about what he really believes."" The film depicts a Stevens-Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that ""it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the 'secret' reason for Stevens's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimate his romance across racial lines.""

In addition to animated (and occasionally live-action) television shows such as ""Ulysses 31"" (1981), ""Inspector Gadget"" (1983–1986), ""The Littles"" (1983), ""The Real Ghostbusters"" (1986–1991), ""Heathcliff"" (1984–1988), ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"" (1990-1993), ""Mummies Alive"" (1997), ""Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century"" (1999), and the first two seasons of the English adaptation of ""Sailor Moon"" (1995–1998), DIC produced live-action feature films while under Disney, including 1998's ""Meet the Deedles"" and 1999's ""Inspector Gadget"". It was founded in 1971 as DIC Audiovisuel by Frenchman Jean Chalopin in Paris, as a subsidiary of RTL Group (RTL), Europe's leading entertainment company, which today, is majority-owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. ""DIC"" was originally an acronym for Diffusion, Information et Communication. They later had a US office in Burbank. Andy Heyward then bought the business and DiC became an American company. The company was also known as The Incredible World of DiC, DiC. Audiovisuel, DiC Enterprises, DIC Animation City and DIC Productions.

DIC Entertainment's American arm was founded in 1982 as DIC Enterprises, headed by Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi, in Burbank, California. In 1985, DIC opened their own Japan-based satellite animation facility for animation production on some of their shows (such as the second seasons of ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Heathcliff"", among other shows), so they wouldn't have to mostly deal with other overseas animation subcontractors. In 1986, Heyward and other investors bought the company, thus making the US headquarters the main base of operations. Chalopin and Bianchi left around this time, so did formal producer Tetsuo Katayama, in favor of Robby London and Michael Maliani. After the buyout, the company was in heavy debt and the foreign rights to the DIC library were sold to Saban Productions, who then sold the rights back to Chalopin. At the time, Heyward considered Chalopin an enemy. DIC sued Saban for damages; in 1991, both companies reached a settlement. In 1989, the company's name changed to DiC Animation City. 1990s.

wikipedia-365627," Missing square puzzle  The missing square puzzle is an optical illusion used in mathematics classes to help students reason about geometrical figures. It depicts two arrangements made of similar shapes in slightly different configurations. Each apparently forms a 13×5 right-angled triangle, but one has a 1×1 hole in it. Solution. The key to the puzzle is the fact that neither of the 13×5 ""triangles"" is truly a triangle, because what appears to be the hypotenuse is bent. In other words, the ""hypotenuse"" does not maintain a consistent slope, even though it may appear that way to the human eye. A true 13×5 triangle cannot be created from the given component parts. The four figures (the yellow, red, blue and green shapes) total 32 units of area. The apparent triangles formed from the figures are 13 units wide and 5 units tall, so it appears that the area should be formula_1 units. However, the blue triangle has a ratio of 5:2 (=2.5:1), while the red triangle has the ratio 8:3 (≈2.667:1), so the apparent combined hypotenuse in each figure is actually bent. So with the bent hypotenuse, the first figure actually occupies a combined 32 units, while the second figure occupies 33, including the ""missing"" square. The amount of bending is approximately 1/28th of a unit (1.245364267°), which is difficult to see on the diagram of this puzzle. Note the grid point where the red and blue triangles in the lower image meet (5 squares to the right and two units up from the lower left corner of the combined figure), and compare it to the same point on the other figure; the edge is slightly under the mark in the upper image, but goes through it in the lower. Overlaying the hypotenuses from both figures results in a very thin parallelogram with an area of exactly one grid square—the same area ""missing"" from the second figure. Principle. According to Martin Gardner, this particular puzzle was invented by a New York City amateur magician, Paul Curry, in 1953. However, the principle of a dissection paradox has been known since the start of the 16th century. The integer dimensions of the parts of the puzzle (2, 3, 5, 8, 13) are successive Fibonacci numbers. Many other geometric dissection puzzles are based on a few simple properties of the Fibonacci sequence. Dimension wise. The dimensions of the parts within each of the two bigger triangles are different, although these two have exactly the same dimensions. This can be realized by accurate measurements as the dimensions alteration is as small as 0.077 of the unit. This means for this trick to be physically done the given figures/parts in each triangle have to overlap each other in order to appear being outside the big triangle outline. Similar puzzles. Sam Loyd's paradoxical dissection. In the ""larger"" rearrangement, the gaps between the figures have a combined unit square more area than their square gaps counterparts, creating an illusion that the figures there take up more space than those in the square figure. In the ""smaller"" rearrangement, each quadrilateral needs to overlap the triangle by an area of half a unit for its top/bottom edge to align with a grid line. A different puzzle of the same kind (depicted in the animation) uses four congruent quadrilaterals and a small square, which form a larger square. When the quadrilaterals are rotated about their centers they fill the space of the small square, although the total area of the figure seems unchanged. The apparent paradox is explained by the fact that the side of the new large square is a little smaller than the original one. If ""a"" is the side of the large square and ""θ"" is the angle between two opposing sides in each quadrilateral, then the quotient between the two areas is given by sec2""θ"" − 1. For ""θ"" = 5°, this is approximately 1.00765, which corresponds to a difference of about 0.8%. "
wikipedia-365630," Gadget and the Gadgetinis  Gadget and the Gadgetinis is a Canadian series spinoff of the classic series ""Inspector Gadget"", developed by DIC Entertainment in cooperation with Haim Saban's SIP Animation and produced from 2001 to 2003. There are 52 episodes. Plot. Gadget is now a lieutenant, and a member of an organization called ""WOMP"" (World Organization of Mega Powers). He is aided in his work by Penny (who is now twelve years old), as well as the new robot characters Digit and Fidget, the titular Gadgetinis invented by Penny, who essentially replace Brain the dog in this series (who is supposedly retired from active duty) and Chief Quimby (who now works as an informant for the head of WOMP) has been replaced with Col. Nozzaire, a former member of the French Foreign Legion. The original creators of ""Inspector Gadget"" reunited for this series. Andy Heyward initiated the concept and was one of the executive producers; Jean Chalopin created/developed the show and wrote or co-wrote every episode; while Bruno Bianchi designed the main characters as well as directing and producing the series. ""Gadget & the Gadgetinis"" follows basically the same plot as the original series, with the clumsy Gadget attempting to fight crime while Penny and her helpers do all the work. Some details underwent major changes, though, for instance the villains. Doctor Claw (who in several stories was entirely replaced by other villains - in a few cases aliens) had relatives in some of the episodes. While Brain and Chief Quimby are mostly absent from the show, they do appear in pictures in Gadget's house. Each also appears as a special guest, and only in one episode each. Brain appears in episode 36, ""No Brainer"" which reveals that, having been traumatized after years of pain while saving Gadget, he retired from crime-fighting to live in a riverside house. The mere mention of the word ""gadget"" is enough to drive him frantic. Chief Quimby appears in episode 45, ""Super Boss Gadget"". The French end credits to the series show a series of sketches of Penny going to visit Brain at his riverside home. The pair enjoy an emotional reunion. Maurice LaMarche continued as Gadget's voice, reprising his role from the ""Sunday Movie Toon"", ""Inspector Gadget's Last Case"", as did Brian Drummond (Dr Claw) and Tegan Moss (Penny). Jean-Michel Guirao composed the musical underscore, and the main title song for the English-speaking version was written and performed by Mike Piccirillo. However, the American and French theme songs for ""Gadgetinis"" were explicitly different: The French version's theme, composed by Noam Kaniel and David Vadant, sounded very close to Shuki Levy and Haim Saban's original Inspector Gadget theme, and was in fact based on the original series' theme song. (The French end credits for the show state: ""Musique des génériques: Noam Kaniel, David Vadant, K.I.A. productions. D'après le ""Thème de l'Inspecteur Gadget"". Musique originale de Haim Saban et Shuki Levy."") The reason this was possible - even though DiC Entertainment (which owned ""Inspector Gadget"") no longer had the rights to Levy and Saban's theme music - is probably that ""Gadget and the Gadgetinis"" was produced primarily by the French animation studio SIP Animation, which was owned by Haim Saban. Episodes. Season 1 (2001-2002) Characters. Main characters. Lt.

wikipedia-365634," Felix Dennis  Felix Dennis (born 1947) is a British publisher, poet, and philanthropist. His company, Dennis Publishing, pioneered computer and hobbyist magazine publishing in the United Kingdom. In more recent times, the company has added lifestyle titles such as its flagship brand ""The Week"", which is published in the UK, the United States and Australia. Life and work. Dennis was born in Kingston-upon-Thames in 1947. After leaving Harrow College of Art, Dennis played in R&B bands. Publishing. Dennis started his career as a street seller for the underground counter culture magazine ""Oz"" in 1971. The magazine printed a mixture of left-field stories, discussions of drugs, sex and contentious political stories. Dennis was quickly promoted to co-editor and became involved in the longest conspiracy trial in English history over the ""School Kids"" edition. The editors invited contributions from children, including a sexually explicit drawing of Rupert the Bear. This resulted in a visit from the police and the subsequent arrest of Jim Anderson, Richard Neville and Dennis. Dennis recorded a single with John Lennon to raise money for a legal defence fund. At the conclusion of the trial, the ""Oz Three"", defended by John Mortimer, were found not guilty on the charge of “Conspiracy to deprave and corrupt the Morals of the Young of the Realm,” but were convicted of two lesser offences and sentenced to imprisonment. The convictions were later quashed. Dennis later told author Jonathan Green that on the night before the appeal was heard, the ""Oz"" editors were taken to a secret meeting with the Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, who told them that they would be acquitted if they agreed to give up work on ""Oz"". It is alleged that MPs Tony Benn and Michael Foot had interceded on their behalf. Following acquittal by the Court of Appeal, Dennis went on to found his own magazine publishing company in 1973. ""Kung Fu monthly"" became a success, making over £60,000, aided by the rising popularity of martial artist Bruce Lee. The small company managed to break into the US. Dennis was the second publisher of ""Personal Computer World"" which he later sold to VNU, and established ""MacUser"" which he sold to Ziff Davis Publishing in the mid-eighties. In 1987, he co-founded MicroWarehouse, with Peter Godfrey and Bob Bartner, a company that pioneered direct IT marketing via high quality catalogues. Dennis was awarded the Marcus Morris Award in 1991. The computer mail order company eventually went public on the NASDAQ in 1992. At the time had 3500 employees in 13 countries with worldwide sales in 2000 of $2.5 billion. It was sold to a private investment group in January 2000. This created the bulk of Dennis' personal wealth. Dennis launched further successful IT titles ""Computer Shopper"" and ""PC World"". In 1995, Dennis Publishing created ""Maxim"", a title that became the world's biggest selling men's lifestyle magazine and global brand. In 1996, Dennis acquired a stake in what is now the flagship brand ""The Week"" which is published in the UK, US and Australia and. as of 2009, translates to a global circulation of over 700,000 (ABC audited). Over the following years it purchased the remainder from its founder Jon O'Connell. 2003 saw the purchase of IFG (I Feel Good) from ""Loaded"" founder James Brown. The purchase involved titles ""Viz"", ""Fortean Times"" and ""Bizarre"" being added to the Dennis Publishing stable. In June 2007, Dennis sold his US magazine operation which published the magazines ""Blender"", ""Maxim"" and ""Stuff"" to Alpha Media Group. In 2008, Dennis Publishing established digital magazines ""iGizmo"" and ""iMotor"" along with ""Monkey"" and the purchase of ""The First Post"". Dennis remains the owner of Dennis Publishing, with headquarters in both London and New York City. It currently holds over 50 magazine titles, digital magazines, websites and mobile sites in the UK including ""The Week"", ""Monkey"", ""Auto Express"", ""PC Pro"" and ""Viz"". Its flagship brand ""The Week"" is also published in the US and Australia. Dennis was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2012. Writing. In 1994, Dennis was made a Fellow of the National Library for the Blind in recognition of his continued support for that charity. Accordingly, many of Dennis's books are released in Braille. In 2001, following illness, Dennis took up poetry. Within a year, he wrote his first book of verse ""A Glass Half Full"", published by Hutchinson in the UK. The launch of this book was accompanied by the first of Dennis's UK-wide poetry reading tours entitled “Did I Mention the Free Wine?” Audiences are offered fine French wine from Dennis’s cellar whilst watching Dennis perform his poetry on stage. His poetry has been featured on radio interviews, in the national press and the subject of two major television documentaries. In October 2003, Dennis appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company, along with RSC actors, reading from his work at The Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. With the publication of ""A Glass Half Full"" in the US in 2004, Dennis embarked on a fifteen date coast-to-coast tour of the US (including another RSC performance in New York). The same year ""Lone Wolf"", Dennis's second book of verse came out, again accompanied by a fourteen-date UK tour. In 2006, Dennis wrote a best-seller on how he became a multi-millionaire in ""How to Get Rich"", published by Ebury Press. As well as anecdotes from his life, the book describes his crack cocaine addiction and admission to spending over $100 million on drugs and women. 2010 saw the release of Dennis's follow-up to wealth creation book, ""88 The Narrow Road"". Three more poetry books have followed, ""When Jack Sued Jill: Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times"", ""Island of Dreams"" and ""Homeless in my Heart"", published by Ebury Press. At the end of 2008, Dennis again toured with an eleven-date tour around the UK and Ireland, coinciding with the release of ""Homeless in my Heart"". Both the 2008 and 2010 tours were filmed and a DVD release is expected in the early part of 2011. Tree planting. Dennis is planting the Heart of England Forest, based in Warwickshire in the UK's West Midlands. Over the last ten years, Dennis has established a young forest of native deciduous trees, covering one thousand acres with approximately 600,000 saplings planted to date. The forest also includes a small percentage of ancient woodland. Trees include native varieties of oak, ash, lime, beech hornbeam, hazel, field maple, aspen, hawthorn, willow, alder, black poplar, holly, wild cherry, rowan and occasional stands of Scots pine, along with numerous shrubs and bushes. Where possible, saplings are sourced from locally collected seed. The planting of saplings will continue indefinitely with the aim of eventually providing between 10,000 and 20,000 acres. The forest will then be opened to the public. Julian Assange. Dennis backed Julian Assange by pledging bail in December 2010; the money was lost in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts by entering the London embassy of Ecuador. In the media. Dennis is credited with having been the first person to say the word ""cunt"" on live British television, on 7 November 1970 edition of David Frost's ""The Frost Programme"". Dennis was the guest on ""Desert Island Discs"", hosted by Kirsty Young on BBC Radio 4, first broadcast on 12 August 2007. In an interview with Ginny Dougary published in ""The Times"" on 2 April 2008 Dennis said that in the early 1980s he had killed a man who had been abusing a woman he knew by pushing him off a cliff; Dennis later said he had been talking ""a load of hogwash"" whilst drunk. "
wikipedia-365645," La Llorona  La Llorona (""The Weeping Woman"") is a widespread legend in North and South America. Legend. Although several variations exist, the basic story tells of a beautiful woman by the name of Maria who drowns her children in order to be with the man that she loved. The man would not have her, which devastated her. She would not take no for an answer, so she drowned herself in a lake in Mexico City. Challenged at the gates of heaven as to the whereabouts of her children, she is not permitted to enter the afterlife until she has found them. Maria is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring, with her constant weeping giving her the name ""La Llorona"". She is trapped in between the living world and the spirit world. In some versions of this tale and legend, La Llorona will kidnap wandering children who resemble her missing children, or children who disobey their parents. People who claim to have seen her say she appears at night or in the late evenings from rivers or oceans in Mexico. Some believe that those who hear the wails of La Llorona are marked for death, similar to the Gaelic banshee legend . She is said to cry, ""Ay, mis hijos!"" which translates to, ""Oh, my children!"" Function of the story. Typically, the legend serves as a cautionary tale on several levels. Parents will warn their children that bad behavior will cause La Llorona to abduct them, and that being outside after dark will result in her visitation. The tale also warns young women not to be enticed by status, wealth, material goods, or by men who make declarations of love or lavish promises. Other folktales. La Llorona bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek tale of the demonic demigodess Lamia. Hera, Zeus' wife, learned of his affair with Lamia, and then forced Zeus to give up the relationship and punished Lamia by forcing her to eat her own children. Out of jealousy over the loss of her own children, Lamia preys upon human children and devours them if she catches them. In Greek mythology, Medea killed the two children fathered by Jason (one of the Argonauts) after he left her for another woman.  Local Aztec folklore possibly influenced the legend; the goddess Cihuacoatl or Coatlicue was said to have appeared shortly prior to the discovery of New Spain by Hernán Cortés, weeping for her lost children, an omen of the fall of the Aztec empire. La Llorona is also sometimes identified with La Malinche, the Nahua woman who served as Cortés' interpreter and who some say was betrayed by the Spanish conquistadors. In one folk story of La Malinche, she becomes Cortés' mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that La Malinche killed her children). Aztec pride drove La Malinche to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of New Spain and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with La Llorona's loss. Popular culture. La Llorona was referenced in the Multiplayer online battle arena game League of Legends to commemorate the launch of the game in Latin America. Developer Riot Games released a skin for the character Morgana known as ""Ghost Bride Morgana"" in the United States and ""Morgana la Llorona"" in Spanish-speaking countries, directly referencing the legend. La Llorona also appeared as the ""monster of the week"" in the NBC TV series ""Grimm"" in the ninth episode of Season 2 which first aired on October 26, 2012. She is portrayed by Angela Alvarado Rosa. In this Halloween-themed episode, La Llorona is given a specific pattern: she chooses three child victims, two boys and a girl between the ages of seven and ten, near a forked river: one from each leg of the fork and a third from the leg after the river joins. She is also stated to take all of the children during the day on Halloween, and then takes them back to the rivers' nexus and drown them by midnight that same night. At the end of the episode, she leads her newest victims to the water's edge and cries out to her lost children, begging them to forgive her. The ghosts of her children surface, and she again begs their forgiveness, offering her three victims to ""take place"". Nick Burkhardt (the protagonist and eponymous ""Grimm""), his partner and a Wesen that had ben tracking La Llorona for years come upon the scene before she can lead the children into the water, and he tackles her into the river. The two characters are fighting under the river's surface when midnight strikes, at which point she fades from his (and the camera's) sight. La Llorona is one of the few ""monster"" characters to appear on the show that is not classified as Wesen. La Llorona appeared as the first antagonist in the pilot episode of the TV series ""Supernatural"". Sarah Shahi portrayed Constance Welch, The Weeping Woman who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the life of her two children by drowning them in the bath tub and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those who she deemed are unfaithful. Sam Winchester destroyed her ghost by smashing his car into the house where she used to live in. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Weeping Woman was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them. La Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film La Leyenda de la Nahuala. La Llorona has also been the theme character of several of Universal Studios' haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, Halloween Horror Nights. (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations) The story of La Llorona has been turned into a short comic book story by ""Love and Rockets"" writer/artist Gilbert Hernandez. La Llorona is also one of the various names used by Hopey and Terry's punk band in Jaime Hernandez's ""Mechanics ""series. "
wikipedia-365654," Bayou Teche  The Bayou Teche is a waterway of great cultural significance in south central Louisiana in the United States. Bayou Teche was the Mississippi River's main course when it developed a delta about 2,800 to 4,500 years ago. Through a natural process known as deltaic switching, the river's deposits of silt and sediment cause the Mississippi to change its course every thousand years or so. History. The Teche begins in Port Barre where it draws water from Bayou Courtableau and then flows southward pass to meet the Lower Atchafalaya River at Berwick. During the time of the Acadian migration to what was then known as the Attakapas region, the Teche was the primary means of transportation. During the American Civil War, fighting occurred on Bayou Teche on November 3–5, 1862. Four Federal gunboats with twenty-seven guns came up the Teche despite weak obstructions placed in the bayou by Confederate General Alfred Mouton. The gunboats engaged the Confederate ship ""Cotton"" near Cornay's Bridge in an exchange that lasted for an hour and a half. Though struck several times, the ""Cotton"" escaped real damage. In the next two days, two other duels occurred, and each time the ""Cotton"" prevailed. However, the Union pacified the area of Bayou Teche and the Atchafalaya River. Historian John D. Winters reports: ""Federal troops collected horses, mules, and sugar in large quantities. Planters who remained began taking the oath the U.S. government and were allowed to make contracts with the Negroes to finish their sugar crops.""  After the levees were built along the Atachafalaya River in the 1930s, the Teche and the rice farms located along the bayou suffered a drastic reduction in fresh water. Between 1976 and 1982, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a pumping station at Krotz Springs to pump water from the Atchafalaya River into Bayou Courtableau. The etymology of the name ""Teche"" is uncertain. One hypothesis is that it comes from ""tenche"", a Chitimacha Indian word meaning ""snake"", related to the bayou's twists and turns resembling a snake's movement. The Chitimacha tell an ancient story of how the snake attacked their villages, and it took many warriors many years to kill it. Where the huge carcass lay and decomposed, the depression it left behind filled with water to become the bayou. Alternatively, George R. Stewart asserts that it is, ""probably a French rendering of Deutsch, the name by which the German colonists of the area would have named their stream. Cf. Allemand ['German'].""  The sugar plantation Lagonda was established on Bayou Teche by Lewis Strong Clarke, who was also involved in Republican politics in the late 19th century. Towns on Bayou Teche.

wikipedia-365656," Samut Prakan Province  Samut Prakan ( ) is one of the central provinces (""changwat"") of Thailand, established by the , which came into force as from 9 March 1946. It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province. History. The province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Prapadaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II starting the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with a French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two still exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao. Etymology. In Thai the word ""samut"" is from Sanskrit, ""samudra"", meaning ocean or sea, and the word ""prakan"" is from Sanskrit, ""prākāra"", meaning fortress, walls or stronghold. Geography. Samut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called ""Pak Nam"" (""ปากน้ำ""), the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of approximately 47.2 kilometres. Symbols. The provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is ""Thespesia populnea"". The provincial slogan is ""Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate"" Administrative divisions. The province is subdivided into 6 districts (""amphoe""). The districts are further subdivided into 50 subdistricts (""tambon"") and 396 villages (""muban""). There are one city (""thesaban nakhon""), three towns (""thesaban mueang"") and 13 subdistrict municipalities (""thesaban tambon""). For the national elections the province is divided into 3 voting districts, one eligible for three assemblyman and the other two each for two assemblymen. Tourism. Sights.

wikipedia-365662," Colchicine  Colchicine (Colcrys, and generics) is a medication that treats gout. It is a toxic natural product and secondary metabolite, originally extracted from plants of the genus ""Colchicum"" (autumn crocus, ""Colchicum autumnale"", also known as ""meadow saffron""). It was used originally to treat rheumatic complaints, especially gout, and still finds use for these purposes today despite dosing issues concerning its toxicity. It was also prescribed for its cathartic and emetic effects.  In addition to gout, colchicine is used to treat familial Mediterranean fever, pericarditis, and Behçet's disease.  History. The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus ""(Colchicum autumnale)"", was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1500 B.C.), an Egyptian medical papyrus. Colchicum extract was first described as a treatment for gout in ""De Materia Medica"" by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of ""Colchicum"" to treat gout probably dates to ca. 550 AD, as the ""hermodactyl"" recommended by Alexander of Tralles. ""Colchicum"" corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna and other Islamic physicians, were recommended by Ambroise Pare in the sixteenth century, and appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1618. ""Colchicum"" plants were brought to America by Benjamin Franklin, who suffered from gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as Envoy to France. Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by the French chemists P.S. Pelletier and J.B.Caventou. In 1833, P.L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine. The determination of colchicine's structure required decades, although in 1945 Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule's three rings, two were 7-member rings. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin. FDA approval. Oral colchicine had been used for many years as an unapproved drug with no prescribing information, dosage recommendations, or drug interaction warnings approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On July 30, 2009 the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares), and gave URL Pharma a three-year marketing exclusivity agreement in exchange for URL Pharma doing 17 new studies and investing $100 million into the product, of which $45 million went to the FDA for the application fee. URL Pharma raised the price from $0.09 per tablet to $4.85, and the FDA removed the older unapproved colchicine from the market in October 2010 both in oral and IV form, but gave pharmacies the opportunity to buy up the older unapproved colchicine. Colchicine in combination with probenecid has been FDA approved prior to 1982. Pharmacology. Mechanism of action. Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, one of the main constituents of microtubules. Availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, and therefore colchicine effectively functions as a ""mitotic poison"" or spindle poison.  The mitosis inhibiting function of colchicine has been of great use in the study of cellular genetics. To see the chromosomes of a cell under a light microscope, it is important that they be viewed near the point in the cell cycle in which they are most dense. This occurs near the middle of mitosis (specifically metaphase), so mitosis must be stopped before it completes. Adding colchicine to a culture during mitosis is part of the standard procedure for doing karyotype studies. Apart from inhibiting mitosis (a process heavily dependent on cytoskeletal changes), colchicine also inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect. Indications. Colchicine has a relatively low therapeutic index. In August 2009, colchicine won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States as a stand-alone drug for the treatment of acute flares of gout and familial Mediterranean fever. It had previously been approved as an ingredient in an FDA-approved combination product for gout. The approval was based on a study in which two doses an hour apart were effective at combating the condition. It is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet's disease. Use in cancer treatment. Since one of the defining characteristics of cancer cells is a significantly increased rate of mitosis, this means that cancer cells are significantly more vulnerable to colchicine poisoning than are normal cells. However, the therapeutic value of colchicine against cancer is (as is typical with chemotherapy agents) limited by its toxicity against normal cells. Off-label uses. The British drug development company Angiogene is developing a prodrug of a colchicine congener, ZD6126 (also known as ANG453) as a treatment for cancer. Colchicine is used for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in women, and for treatment of severe or persistent aphthous stomatitis (canker sores). Colchicine is also used as adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment of pericarditis. An Australian randomized trial found low-dose colchine substantially reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke, and sudden death in people with coronary heart disease.  Contraindications. Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in patients with advanced renal failure (including those on dialysis). Ten to 20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Colchicine is not removed by hemodialysis. Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting. A severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates). This neuromuscular condition can be irreversible (even after drug discontinuation). Accompanying dementia has been noted in advanced cases. It may culminate in hypercapnic respiratory failure and death. (Minniti-2005) Adverse effects. Side-effects include gastrointestinal upset and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow and lead to anemia and also cause hair loss. All of these side-effects can result from hyperinhibition of mitosis. A main side-effect associated with all mitotic inhibitors is peripheral neuropathy, which is a numbness or tingling in the hands and feet due to peripheral nerve damage that can become so severe that reduction in dosage or complete cessation of the drug may be required. Microtubules are involved in vesicular transport. Peripheral nerves are among the longest in the body. Brownian motion is not significant enough in these peripheral nerves to allow vesicles to reach their destination. Thus, they are susceptible to microtubule toxins. Toxicity. Colchicine poisoning has been compared to arsenic poisoning. Symptoms start 2 to 5 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and kidney failure. These symptoms may set in as many as 24 hours after exposure. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the GI tract, which may cause death. In addition, sufferers may experience kidney damage that causes low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), anemia; muscular weakness, and respiratory failure. Recovery may begin within six to eight days.  There is no specific antidote for colchicine, though various treatments exist. Certain common inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp, including grapefruit juice, may increase the risk of colchicine toxicity. Biosynthesis. Several experiments show that the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Indeed, the feeding of ""Colchicum autumnale"" with radioactive amino acid, tyrosine-2-C14, caused the latter to partially incorporate in the ring system of colchicine. The induced absorption of radioactive phenylalanine-2-C14 by ""Colchicum byzantinum"", another plant of the Colchicaceae family, resulted in its efficient absorption by colchicine. However, it was proven that the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted, in essence, from the expansion of the tyrosine ring.  Further radioactive feeding experiments of ""Colchicum autumnale"" revealed that Colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from ""(S)""-Autumnaline. That biosynthesic pathway occurs primarily through a para-para phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes ""O""-methylation directed by S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM). Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring leads to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by ""N""-formyldemecolcine. ""N""-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after addition of acetyl-Coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine. Botanical use. Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine is also used for inducing polyploidy in plant cells during cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during meiosis; half the resulting gametes, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contain double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., diploid instead of haploid, as gametes usually are), and lead to embryos with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in animal cells, in plant cells it is not only usually well tolerated but in fact frequently results in plants that are larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable than the normally diploid parents; for this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially. When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring will usually be sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively. Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated must buy fresh seed from a supplier each year. Many sterile triploid plants, including some tree and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species. In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create ""seedless"" fruit, such as seedless watermelons ""(Citrullus lanatus)"". Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce fruit production. Colchicine's ability to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× ""Triticosecale"") from wheat (""Triticum"" spp.) and rye (""Secale cereale""). Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile; treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale. When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker. Also, seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting. Another way to induce polyploidy is to chop off the tops of plants and carefully examine the regenerating lateral shoots and suckers to see if any look different. If no visual difference is evident, flow cytometry can be used for analysis. Doubling of plant chromosome numbers also occurs spontaneously in nature, with many familiar plants being fertile polyploids. Natural hybridization between fertile parental plants of different levels of polyploidy can produce new plants at an intermediate level, such as a triploid produced by crossing between a diploid and a tetraploid, or a hexaploid produced by crossing between a diploid and an octoploid. Marketing exclusivity in the United States. As a drug predating the FDA, colchicine was sold in the United States for many years without having been reviewed by the FDA for safety and efficacy. In 2009, the FDA reviewed an NDA submitted by URL Pharma and approved colchicine for gout flares, awarding Colcrys a three-year term of market exclusivity, prohibiting generic sales, and increasing the price of the drug from $0.09 to $4.85 per tablet. Numerous consensus guidelines, and previous randomized controlled trials, had concluded that colchicine is effective for acute flares of gouty arthritis. However, as of 2006, the drug was not formally approved by the FDA, owing to the lack of a conclusive randomized control trial (RCT). That year, the FDA started an ""Unapproved Drugs Initiative"", through which they sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs. In exchange for paying for the costly testing, the FDA gave URL Pharma three years of market exclusivity for its Colcrys brand, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, based in part on URL-funded research in 2007, including pharmacokinetic studies and a randomized control trial with 185 patients with acute gout. URL Pharma also received seven years of market exclusivity for Colcrys in treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, under the Orphan Drug Law. URL Pharma then raised the price per tablet from $0.09 to $4.85 and sued to remove other versions from the market, increasing annual costs for the drug to U.S. state Medicaid programs from $1 million to $50 million. Medicare also paid significantly higher costs—making this a direct money-loser for the government. (In a similar case, thalidomide was approved in 1998 as an orphan drug for leprosy and in 2006 for multiple myeloma.) In April 2010, in an editorial in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" (NEJM), A.S. Kesselheim and D.H. Solomon said that the rewards of this legislation are not calibrated to the quality or value of the information produced, that there is no evidence of meaningful improvement to public health, that it would be much less expensive for the FDA, the National Institutes of Health or large insurers like medicare and medicaid or coalitions of private insurers to pay for trials themselves. Furthermore, the cost burden of this subsidy falls primarily on patients or their insurers. URL Pharma posted a detailed rebuttal of the NEJM editorial.  In September 2010, the FDA ordered a halt to marketing unapproved single-ingredient oral colchicine. "
wikipedia-365670," Indore  Indore (, ) ( इंदूर in Marathi), the largest city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It serves as the headquarters of both Indore District and Indore Division. A central power city, Indore exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment and has been described as the commercial capital of the state. Located on the southern edge of Malwa Plateau, the city is located 190 km west of the state capital of Bhopal. With a Census-estimated 2011 population of 2,167,447 distributed over a land area of just (526 km2), Indore is the most densely populated major city in the central province. The Indore Metropolitan Area's population is the state's largest, with 2.2 million people living there. It is the 14th largest city in India and 147th largest city in the world. Indore traces its roots to its 16th century founding as a trading hub between the Deccan and Delhi. The city and its surroundings came under Maratha Empire on 18 May 1724 after Maratha Peshwa assumed the full control of Malwa. During the days of the British Raj it was a 19 Gun Salute (21 locally) princely state (a rare high rank) ruled by the Maratha Holkar dynasty, until they acceded to the Union of India. Indore served as the capital of the Madhya Bharat from 1950 until 1956. Indore's financial district, anchored by central Indore, functions as the financial capital of the Madhya Pradesh and is home to the Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange, India's third oldest stock exchange. Indore's real estate market is among the most expensive in the state and its Lokmanya Nagar incorporates the highest concentration of Marathi People in the Western part of the city. . Numerous colleges and universities are located in Indore, including IIM Indore and IIT Indore. Etymology. Legends say that while on a journey to conquer Ujjain, Raja Shailendra Singh laid a camp beside the river Kanh (modern name Khan) and was very impressed by the scenic greenery of the place. And thus he laid a Shivling at the meeting place of the rivers Kanh and Saraswati and got the Indreshwar temple constructed along with the settlement Indrapur. Years later under the Maratha Rule, when it was given to the Maratha Subedar (General) 'Malhar Rao Holkar', its name had evolved to Indur. This name was changed to Indore during the British raj History. Origins. Indore owes its early growth to trade and commerce, which is still a dominant feature of the city. The present city is about 400 years old settlement. Till the end of 15th century its original nucleus was a riverside village, which occupied the bank of river Saraswati. This area is now known as Juni Indore. The area of the modern Indore city was a part of the Kampel pargana (administrative unit) during the Mughal Empire. Kampel was administered by the Ujjain ""sarkar"" (government) of Malwa Subah (province). The area was controlled by the local zamindars (feudal landlords), who accepted the suzerainty of the Mughal empire. The zamindars received the title of ""Chaudhari"", which established their claim to the land. The modern settlement was developed by Rao Nandlal Chaudhary, the chief local zamindar, who had an army of 2000 soldiers. Under the Mughal rule, his family enjoyed great influence and was accorded confirmatory ""sanad""s by the Emperors Aurangzeb and Farrukhsiyar, confirming their jagir (land ownership) rights. When Nandlal visited the Mughal court at Delhi, he received a special place in the emperor's court along with two jewel studded swords (now on display in the Royal British Museum under the family's name) and confirmatory ""sanad""s. Jai Singh II, a personal friend of his, gifted him with a special ""Gold Langar"" which guaranteed a special place to him in all the courts of India. In the mid-1710s, Nandlal was caught in the struggle between the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad (who had been appointed as the governor of the Deccan region by the Mughal emperor). Once, while visiting the Indreshwar Temple near the banks of river Saraswati, Nandlal found the location to be safe and strategically located, being surrounded by rivers on all sides. He started moving his people in, and constructed the fort of Shree Sansthan Bada Rawala to protect them from harassment by the warring forces. This marked the establishment of the present-day Indore city, which became an important trade center on the Delhi-Deccan route. The Maratha Raj (Holkar era). By 1720, the headquarters of the local pargana were transferred from Kampel to Indore, due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. On 18 May 1724, the Nizam accepted the rights of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I to collect chauth (taxes) from the area. In 1733, the Peshwa assumed the full control of Malwa, and appointed his commander Malhar Rao Holkar as the Subhedar (Governor) of the province. Nandlal Chaudhary accepted the suzerainty of the Marathas. During the Maratha rule, the Chaudharis came to be known as ""Mandloi""s (derived from Mandals meaning districts). The Holkars conferred the title of ""Rao Raja"" upon Nandlal's family. The family retained its possessions of royalty, in addition to the right of performing the first puja of Dushera (""Shami Pujan"") before the Holkar rulers. The respectability and influence of Nandlal's family in the region was instrumental in the ascent of the Peshwas and Holkars to rulership of this region. On 29 July 1732, Bajirao Peshwa-I granted Holkar State by merging 28 and half parganas to Malhar Rao Holkar, the founder ruler of Holkar dynasty. His daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state's capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre. During the period of Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar II (1852–86) efforts were made for the planned development and industrial development of Indore. With the introduction of Railways in 1875, the business in Indore flourished till the reign of Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III and Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar. British era. In 1818, the Holkars and Scindias were defeated by the British during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, in the Battle of Mahidpur by virtue of which the capital was again moved from Maheshwar to Indore. A residency with British resident was established at Indore, but Holkars continued to rule Indore as a princely state mainly due to efforts of their Dewan Tatya Jog. During that time, Indore was established the headquarters of British Central Agency. In 1906 electric supply was started in the city, fire brigade was established in 1909 and in 1918, first master-plan of city was made by noted architect and town planner, Patrick Geddes. Post Independence. After India's independence in 1947, Holkar State, along with a number of neighbouring princely states acceded to Indian Union.

wikipedia-365689," Buteyko method  The Buteyko method or Buteyko Breathing Technique is a form of complementary or alternative physical therapy that proposes the use of breathing exercises as a treatment for asthma as well as other conditions. The method takes its name from Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko (Ukrainian: Бутейко) (1923 – 2003), who first formulated its principles during the 1950s. This method is based on the assumption that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused by chronically increased respiratory rate or deeper breathing (hyperventilation). However, this theory is not widely supported in the medical community due to the lack of evidence supporting either the theory behind the method or that it works in practice. This method purportedly retrains the breathing pattern through chronic repetitive breathing exercises to correct the hyperventilation, which, according to the method's proponents, will therefore treat or cure asthma as well as any other conditions purportedly caused by hyperventilation. At the core of the Buteyko method is a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, breath-holding and relaxation. Research into the use of the Buteyko method has focused almost exclusively on the treatment of asthma, and have had methodological problems. Studies have not found objective measures to support its use such as improvement in lung function, though there are results showing it may improve subjective measures such as asthma symptoms and quality of life. Reviews of this medical literature have come to different conclusions about the strength of evidence supporting the Buteyko method, with older literature saying the evidence does not support its use, while more recent and up-to-date reviews and guidelines have found the evidence is enough to consider qualified support. The literature that supports considering its use note the Buteyko method should be used with traditional therapies (and not in place of mainstream treatment) and is unlikely to affect the underlying cause of asthma. There is no support for the use of the Buteyko method in other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or any of the over 150 diseases supporters of this method claim to treat. History. The Buteyko method was originally developed in the 1950s by physiologist Konstantin Buteyko in Russia. The first official study into the effectiveness of the Buteyko Method on asthma was undertaken in 1968 at the Leningrad Institute of Pulmonology. The second, held at the First Moscow Institute of Pediatric Diseases in April 1980, eventually led to the head of the ministry of health to issue an order (No 591) for the implementation of the Buteyko method in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Later, this method was introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, where it has received increasing exposure. Anecdotal reports of life-changing improvements attributed to the Buteyko method abound on the internet and in books. The Buteyko method is just one of a number of breathing retraining methods in use for treating lung diseases, including conventional techniques such as physiotherapist led breathing exercises as well alternative medicine techniques like Buteyko such as yoga. Theory. The Buteyko method is based on the concept that ""hidden"" or undiagnosed hyperventilation is the underlying cause of numerous medical conditions, including asthma. It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low carbon dioxide levels in the blood (or hypocapnea), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the acid-base balance in the blood and lower tissue oxygen levels. Advocates of this method believe that the effects of ""chronic"" hyperventilation would have even wider effects than is commonly accepted. These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways (bronchospasm), disturbance of cell energy production via the Krebs cycle, as well as disturbance of numerous vital homeostatic chemical reactions in the body. The Buteyko method is a purported method of ""retraining"" the body's breathing pattern to correct for the presumed ""chronic"" hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and thereby treat or cure the body of these medical problems. The Buteyko method is not widely supported in the medical community, in part due to the fact that research has not supported this theory that hyperventilation and hypocapnea causes disease, with one review noting that there is no convincing evidence to indicate that trying to change asthmatic's carbon dioxide level is either ""desirable or achievable."" Studies that have looked for evidence to corroborate this theory, such as looking at the carbon dioxide levels in practitioners of Buteyko, have not found this evidence, leading some to propose alternate theoretical pathways for this method to improve symptoms. Description. Although variations exist among teachers of the technique in different countries, the main objective is ""normalization"" of breathing and the three core principles of Buteyko remain the same: nasal breathing, reduced breathing and relaxation. Nasal breathing. The Buteyko method emphasizes the importance of nasal breathing, which protects the airways by humidifying, warming, and cleaning the air entering the lungs. A majority of asthmatics have problems sleeping at night, and this is thought by Buteyko practitioners to be linked with poor posture or unconscious mouth-breathing. By keeping the nose clear and encouraging nasal breathing during the day, night-time symptoms can also improve. Strictly nasal breathing during physical exercise is another key element of the Buteyko method. Reduced breathing exercises. The core Buteyko exercises involve breath control; consciously reducing either breathing rate or breathing volume. Many teachers refer to Buteyko as 'breathing retraining' and compare the method to learning to ride a bicycle. Once time has been spent practicing, the techniques become instinctive and the exercises are gradually phased out as the condition improves. Buteyko uses a measurement called the Control Pause (CP), defined as the amount of time that an individual can comfortably hold breath after a normal exhalation. According to Buteyko teachers, with regular Buteyko reduced-breathing practice, asthmatics are expected to find that their CP gradually increases and their pulse rate decreases in parallel decreased asthma symptoms. Relaxation. Dealing with asthma attacks is an important factor of Buteyko practice. The first feeling of an asthma attack is unsettling and can result in a short period of rapid breathing. By controlling this initial over-breathing phase, asthmatics can prevent a ""vicious circle of over-breathing"" from developing and spiraling into an asthma attack. This means that asthma attacks may be averted simply by breathing less. Effectiveness. Advocates of the Buteyko method report a wide range of other diseases and symptoms (numbering up to 150), including diabetes, reproductive disorders and psychological disorders, which they believe is aggravated by hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and therefore are treated by use of the Buteyko method. However, research into the effectiveness of Buteyko have focused almost exclusively on asthma with a small amount of research on sleep apnea. Members of the medical community have been skeptical of the efficacy of Buteyko due to the often ""exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims"" earlier made by Buteyko practitioners. There are few high quality studies such as randomized controlled trials looking at the efficacy of treating asthma with ""breathing retraining"" methods in general, which include the Buteyko method, yoga training and other relaxation techniques. Many of the studies that have evaluated breathing retraining have significant methodological flaws, including small sample sizes, possible patient selection bias as well as heterogeneity in design that makes coming to a firm conclusion difficult. These studies are also hampered by the difficulty in proper blinding and placebo control which could introduce more bias into these studies. The results from these studies have found trends of subjective improvement in factors such as asthma symptoms and measurement of quality of life with use of the Buteyko method and possible reduced rescue inhaler usage. However, these studies have found no improvement in objective measures such as peak flow and FEV1 which are the typical measures for measuring the severity of asthma, or carbon dioxide level in the blood. Based on the available evidence, reviews of the literature and expert medical guidelines have come to conflicting conclusions about the Buteyko method, though most have called for more research, including larger trials involving more patients. On the one hand, a Cochrane review found ""no reliable conclusions"" could be determined based on the limited available evidence, and the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute asthma guideline concluded ""there is insufficient evidence to suggest that breathing techniques provide clinical benefit to patients who have asthma."" On the other hand, two more recent reviews have expressed qualified support for considering breathing retraining techniques, which include techniques such as physiotherapist led breathing exercises and yoga breathing in addition to Buteyko. These reviews noted these techniques should only be used as adjuncts to typical treatment with medications for symptom control, as these techniques are unlikely to affect the underlying processes causing the asthma and that the weight of available evidence is not strong enough to come to a definitive conclusion. The British Thoracic Society stated the Buteyko method ""may be considered to help patients control the symptoms of asthma"" while recognizing the lack of data showing an objective improvement in prior studies. An expert guideline by the Global Initiative for Asthma noted that results from one study suggested that improvement in symptoms by breathing exercises may be due to causes other than changes in the underlying physiology of the disease, such as relaxation, voluntary reduction in medication use and increased participation of the patient in their own care. This result suggests patients who experience anxiety or who overuse their rescue inhalers in particular may benefit from any breathing techniques as an adjunct to conventional treatments, though cost of using these techniques may be prohibitive.

wikipedia-365698," Second Seminole War  The Second Seminole War, also known as the Florida War, was a conflict from 1835 to 1842 in Florida between various groups of Native Americans collectively known as Seminoles and the United States, part of a series of conflicts called the Seminole Wars. The Second Seminole War, often referred to as ""the"" Seminole War, was the most expensive Indian War fought by the United States. Background. Bands from various tribes in the southeastern United States had moved into the unoccupied lands in Florida in the 18th century. These included Alabamas, Choctaws, Yamasees, Yuchis and Creek people. The Creeks were the largest group, and included Lower Creeks and Upper Creeks, and both Hitchiti- and Muscogee-speakers. One group of Hitchiti-speakers, the Mikasuki, settled around what is now Lake Miccosukee near Tallahassee. Another group of Hitchiti-speakers settled around the Alachua Prairie in what is now Alachua County. The Spanish in St. Augustine began calling the Alachua Creeks ""Cimarrones"", which roughly meant ""wild ones"" or ""runaways"", and which is the probable origin of ""Seminole"". This name was eventually also applied to the other groups in Florida, although the Native Americans still regarded themselves as members of different tribes. Other groups in Florida at the time of the Seminole Wars included ""Spanish Indians"", so called because it was believed that they were descended from Calusas, and ""rancho Indians"", persons of Native American ancestry, possibly both Calusa and Creek, and mixed Native American/Spanish ancestry, living at Spanish/Cuban fishing camps on the Florida coast. The United States and Spain were at odds over Florida after the Treaty of Paris ended the American Revolutionary War and returned East and West Florida to Spanish control. The United States disputed the boundaries of West Florida (which had been established while the territory was under British control). They accused the Spanish authorities of harboring fugitive slaves and of failing to restrain the Native Americans living in Florida from raiding into the United States. Starting in 1810, the United States occupied and annexed parts of West Florida. In 1817 Andrew Jackson led an invasion of the Floridas, an incident known as the First Seminole War.  The United States subsequently acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams-Onís Treaty and took possession in 1821. Now that Florida belonged to the United States, the government was pressured by settlers to remove the Seminoles. In 1823 the government negotiated the Treaty of Moultrie Creek with the Seminoles, establishing a reservation for them in the middle of the state. Six chiefs, however, were allowed to keep their villages along the Apalachicola River. The Seminoles gave up their lands in the panhandle and slowly settled into the reservation, although they had isolated clashes with whites. Col. (later Gen.) Duncan Lamont Clinch was placed in charge of the Army units in Florida. Fort King was built near the reservation agency, at the site of present-day Ocala, Florida.  By early 1827 the Army reported that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. This peace lasted for five years, during which time there were repeated calls for the Seminoles to be sent west of the Mississippi. The Seminoles were opposed to the move, and especially to the suggestion that they placed on the Creek reservation. Most whites regarded the Seminoles as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminoles claimed Florida as their home and denied that they had any connection with the Creeks. The status of runaway slaves was a continuing irritation between Seminoles and whites. Spain had given freedom to slaves who escaped to Florida under their rule, although the US did not recognize it. Over the years, those who became known as Black Seminoles established communities near Seminole villages, and the two peoples had close alliances although they maintained separate cultures. Slave catchers argued over the ownership of slaves. New plantations in Florida increased the pool of slaves who could escape to the Seminoles.  Worried about the possibility of an Indian uprising and/or an armed slave rebellion, Governor DuVal requested additional Federal troops for Florida. Instead, Fort King was closed in 1828. The Seminoles, short of food and finding the hunting becoming poorer on the reservation, were wandering off of it more often. Also in 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected President of the United States. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. They wanted to solve the problems with the Seminoles by moving them to west of the Mississippi River. Treaty of Payne's Landing. In the spring of 1832 the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the Oklawaha River. The treaty negotiated there called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land was found to be suitable. They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already been settled there, on March 28, 1833 the seven chiefs signed a statement that the new land was acceptable.  Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it. They said they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation. Even some U.S. Army officers claimed that the chiefs had been ""wheedled and bullied into signing."" Others noted ""there is evidence of trickery by the whites in the way the treaty is phrased."" The members of the villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, as they suffered more encroachment from European Americans; they went west in 1834. The United States Senate finally ratified the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834. The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, ""the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead."" General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, ""Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force."" The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed. Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior beginning to be noticed by the whites, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, ""The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh."" In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend, and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers in. The situation grew worse. A group of whites assaulted some Indians sitting around a campfire. Two more Indians came up during the assault and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded, and one Indian was killed and one wounded. In August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom Dalton, Georgia is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King. In November, Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, led his people to Fort Brooke, where they were to board ships to go west. This was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail and killed him. The Dade Massacre. As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles. The U.S. Army had 11 companies, about 550 soldiers, stationed in Florida. Fort King had only one company of soldiers, and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles. There were three companies at Fort Brooke, with another two expected momentarily, so it was decided to send two companies to Fort King. On December 23, 1835 the two companies, totaling 110 men, left Fort Brooke under the command of Maj. Francis L. Dade. Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days. On December 28 the Seminoles ambushed the soldiers, and killed all but three of the command, which became known as the Dade Massacre. Only three white men survived; Edwin De Courcey, was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day. The two survivors, Ransome Clarke and Joseph Sprague, returned to Fort Brooke. Only Clarke, who died of his wounds a few years later, left any account of the battle from the Army's perspective. Joseph Sprague was unharmed and lived quite a while longer, but was not able to give an account of the battle as he had sought immediate refuge in a nearby pond. The Seminoles lost just three men, with five wounded. On the same day as the Dade Massacre, Osceola and his followers shot and killed Wiley Thompson and six others outside of Fort King. In February, Major Ethan Allen Hitchcock was among those who found the remains of the Dade party. In his journal he wrote about the discovery and vented his bitter discontent with the conflict:  ""The government is in the wrong, and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians, who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty. The natives used every means to avoid a war, but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government."" On December 29 General Clinch left Fort Drane (recently established on Clinch's plantation, about twenty miles (32 km) northwest of Fort King) with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. They were going to a Seminole stronghold called the Cove of the Withlacoochee, an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the Withlacoochee River. When they reached the river, they could not find the ford, and Clinch had his regular troops ferried across the river in a single canoe they had found. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops survived only by fixing bayonets and charging the Seminoles, at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the Army troops withdrew across the river.  On January 6, 1836 a band of Seminoles attacked the coontie plantation of William Cooley on the New River (in present-day Fort Lauderdale, Florida), killing his wife and children and the children's tutor. The other residents of the New River area and of the Biscayne Bay country to the south fled to Key West. On January 17, volunteers and Seminoles met south of St. Augustine at the Battle of Dunlawton. The volunteers lost four men, with thirteen wounded. On January 19, 1836 the Navy sloop-of-war ""Vandalia"" was dispatched to Tampa Bay from Pensacola. On the same day 57 U.S. Marines were dispatched from Key West to help man Fort Brooke. General Gaines' expedition. The regular American army was very small at the time, with less than 7,500 men manning a total of 53 posts. It was spread thin, with the Canadian border to guard, coastal fortifications to man, and especially, Indians to move west and then watch and keep separated from white settlers. Temporary needs for additional troops were filled by state and territory militias, and by self-organized volunteer units. As news and rumors of the fighting spread, action was taken on many levels. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott was placed in charge of the war. Congress appropriated US$620,000 for the war. Volunteer companies began forming in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. General Gaines put together a force of 1,100 regulars and volunteers in New Orleans and sailed with them to Fort Brooke. When Gaines reached Fort Brooke, he found it low on supplies. Believing that General Scott had sent supplies to Fort King, Gaines led his men on to Fort King. Along the road they found the site of the Dade Massacre, and buried the bodies in three mass graves. The force reached Fort King after nine days, only to find it was very short on supplies. After receiving seven days worth of rations from General Clinch at Fort Drane, Gaines headed back for Fort Brooke. Hoping to accomplish something for his efforts, Gaines took his men on a different route back to Fort Brooke, intending to engage the Seminoles in their stronghold in the Cove of the Withlacoochee River. Due to a lack of knowledge of the country, the Gaines party reached the same point on the Withlacoochee where Clinch had met the Seminoles one-and-a-half months earlier, and it took another day to find the ford while the two sides exchanged gunfire across the river. When a crossing was attempted at the ford of the Withlacoochee, Lt. James Izard was wounded (and later died). General Gaines was stuck. He could not cross the river, and if he returned to Fort King his men would be out of rations. Gaines had his men construct a fortification, called Camp Izard, and sent word to General Clinch. Gaines hoped that the Seminoles would concentrate around Camp Izard, and that Clinch's forces could then hit the Seminoles in their flank, crushing them between the two forces. Unfortunately, General Scott, who was in charge of the war, ordered Clinch to stay at Fort Drane. Gaines's men were soon reduced to eating their horses and mules, and an occasional dog, while a battle went on for eight days. Still at Fort Drane, Clinch requested that General Scott change his orders and allow him to go to Gaines' aid. Clinch finally decided to disobey Scott and left to join Gaines just one day before Scott's permission to do so arrived at Fort Drane. Clinch and his men reached Camp Izard on March 6, chasing away the Seminoles. General Scott's campaign. General Scott had begun assembling men and supplies for a grand campaign against the Seminoles. Three columns, totaling 5,000 men, were to converge on the Cove of the Withlacoochee, trapping the Seminoles with a force large enough to defeat them. Scott would accompany one column, under the command of General Clinch, moving south from Fort Drane. A second column, under Brig. Gen. Abraham Eustis, would travel southwest from Volusia, a town on the St. Johns River. The third wing, under the command of Col. William Lindsay, would move north from Fort Brooke. The plan was for the three columns to arrive at the Cove simultaneously so as to prevent the Seminoles from escaping. Eustis and Lindsay were supposed to be in place on March 25, so that Clinch's column could drive the Seminoles into them. On the way from St. Augustine to Volusia to take up his starting position, Gen. Eustis found Pilaklikaha, or Palatlakaha, also known as Abraham's Town. Abraham was a Black Seminole leader, and interpreter for the Seminoles. Eustis burned the town before moving on to Volusia. All three columns were delayed. Eustis was two days late departing Volusia because of an attack by the Seminoles. Clinch's and Lindsay's columns only reached their positions on March 28. Because of problems crossing through uncharted territory, Eustis's column did not arrive until March 30. Clinch crossed the Withlacoochee on March 29 to attack the Seminoles in the Cove, but found the villages deserted. Eustis's column did fight a skirmish with some Seminoles before reaching its assigned position, but the whole action had killed or captured only a few Seminoles. On March 31 all three commanders, running low on supplies, headed for Fort Brooke. The failure of the expedition to effectively engage the Seminoles was seen as a defeat, and was blamed on insufficient time for planning and an inhospitable climate. The Army retreats, Governor Call tries his hand. April 1836 did not go well for the Army. Seminoles attacked a number of forts, including Camp Cooper in the Cove, Fort Alabama on the Hillsborough River north of Fort Brooke, Fort Barnwell near Volusia, and Fort Drane itself. The Seminoles also burned the sugar works on Clinch's plantation. After that, Clinch resigned his commission and left the territory. Fort Alabama was abandoned in late April. In late May, Fort King was also abandoned. In June the soldiers in a blockhouse on the Withlacoochee were rescued after being besieged by the Seminoles for 48 days. On July 23, 1836, Seminoles attacked the Cape Florida lighthouse, severely wounding the assistant keeper in charge and killing his assistant, and burning the lighthouse. The lighthouse was not repaired until 1846. Fort Drane was abandoned in July because of illness, with five out of seven officers and 140 men on the sick list. The Army was suffering terribly from illness; at the time summer in Florida was called the ""sickly season"". By the end of August, Fort Defiance, on the edge of the Alachua Prairie, was also abandoned. Seeing that the war promised to be long and expensive, Congress appropriated another US$1.5 million, and allowed volunteers to enlist for up to a year. Richard Keith Call, who had led the Florida volunteers as a Brig. Gen. when Clinch marched on the Cove of the Withlacoochee in December, had been appointed Governor of the Territory of Florida on March 16, 1836. Governor Call proposed a summer campaign using militias and volunteers instead of regular Army troops. The War Department agreed to this proposal, but delays in preparations meant the campaign did not start until the end of September. Call also intended to attack the Cove of the Withlacoochee. He sent most of his supplies down the west coast of the peninsula and up the Withlacoochee to set up a supply base. With the main body of his men he marched to the now abandoned Fort Drane, and then on to the Withlacoochee, which they reached on October 13. The Withlacoochee was flooding and could not be forded. The army could not make rafts for a crossing because they had not brought any axes with them. In addition, Seminoles on the other side of the river were shooting at any soldier who showed himself along the river. Call then turned west along the north bank of the river to reach the supply depot. However, the steamer bringing the supplies had sunk in the lower part of the river, and the supply depot was far downstream from where Call was expecting it. Out of food, Call led his men back to Fort Drane, another failed expedition against the Cove. In mid-November Call tried again. His forces made it across the Withlacoochee this time, but found the Cove abandoned. Call divided his forces, and proceeded up the river (south) on both sides. On November 17 Seminoles were routed from a large camp. There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to be headed for the Wahoo Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the Wahoo Swamp on November 21. The Seminoles resisted the advance in the Battle of Wahoo Swamp, as their families were close by, but had to retreat across a stream. Major David Moniac, a mix-blooded Creek who was the first Native American to graduate from West Point, tried to determine how deep the stream was, but was shot and killed by the Seminoles. Faced with trying to cross a stream of unknown depth under hostile fire, and with supplies again running short, Call withdrew and led his men to Volusia. On December 9 Call was relieved of command and replaced by Maj. Gen. Thomas Jesup, who took the troops back to Fort Brooke. The enlistments of the volunteers were up at the end of December and they went home. Jesup takes command. In 1836 the United States Army had just four Major Generals. Alexander Macomb, Jr. was the commanding general of the Army. Edmund Gaines and Winfield Scott had each taken to the field and failed to defeat the Seminoles. Thomas Jesup was the last Major General available. Jesup had just suppressed an uprising of the Creeks of western Georgia and eastern Alabama (the Creek War of 1836), upstaging Winfield Scott in the process. Jesup brought a new approach to the war. Instead of sending large columns out to try to force the Seminoles into a set-piece battle, he concentrated on wearing the Seminoles down. This required a large military presence in Florida, and Jesup eventually had a force of more than 9,000 men under his command. About half of the force were volunteers and militia. It also included a brigade of Marines, and Navy and Revenue-Marine personnel patrolling the coast and inland rivers and streams. The Navy and the Revenue-Marine both worked with the Army from the beginning of the war. Navy ships and revenue cutters ferried men and supplies to Army posts. They patrolled the Florida coast to gather information on and intercept Seminoles, and to block smuggling of arms and supplies to the Seminoles. Sailors and Marines helped man Army forts that were short of manpower. Sailors, Marines and revenue-Marines participated in expeditions into the interior of Florida, both by boat and on land. Against those numbers the Seminoles had started the war with between 900 and 1,400 warriors, and with no means of replacing their losses. Truce and reversal. January 1837 saw a change in the war. In various actions a number of Seminoles and Black Seminoles were killed or captured. At the Battle of Hatchee-Lustee, the Marine brigade captured between thirty and forty Seminoles and blacks, mainly women and children, along with 100 pack ponies and 1,400 head of cattle. At the end of January some Seminole chiefs sent messengers to Jesup, and a truce was arranged. Fighting did not stop right away, and a meeting between Jesup and the chiefs did not occur until near the end of February. In March a 'Capitulation' was signed by a number of chiefs, including Micanopy, stipulating that the Seminoles could be accompanied by their allies and ""their negroes, their 'bona fide' property"" in their relocation to the West. Even as Seminoles began to come into the Army camps to await transportation west, slave catchers were claiming blacks living with the Seminoles. As the Seminoles had no written records of ownership, they generally lost in disputes over ownership. Other whites were trying to have Seminoles arrested for alleged crimes or debts. All of this made the Seminoles suspicious of promises made by Jesup. On the other hand, it was noted that many of the warriors coming into the transportation camps had not brought their families, and seemed mainly to be interested in collecting supplies. By the end of May, many chiefs, including Micanopy, had surrendered. Two important leaders, Osceola and Sam Jones, had not surrendered, however, and were known to be vehemently opposed to relocation. On June 2 these two leaders with about 200 followers entered the poorly guarded holding camp at Fort Brooke and led away the 700 Seminoles there who had surrendered. The war was on again, and Jesup would never again trust the word of an Indian. The war did not immediately resume on a large scale. General Jesup had thought that the surrender of so many Seminoles meant the war was ending, and had not planned a long campaign. Many of the soldiers had been assigned elsewhere, or, in the case of militias and volunteers, released from duty. It was also getting into summer, the 'sickly season', and the Army did not fight aggressively in Florida during the summer. The Panic of 1837 was reducing government revenues, but Congress appropriated another US$1.6 million for the war. In August the Army stopped supplying rations to civilians who had taken refuge at its forts. Captures and false flags. Jesup did keep pressure on the Seminoles by sending small units into the field. Many of the blacks with the Seminoles began turning themselves in. After a couple of swings in policy on dealing with fugitive slaves, Jesup ended up sending most of them west to join the Seminoles that were already in Indian territory. On September 10, 1837 the Army and militias captured a band of Mikasukis including King Phillip, one of the most important chiefs in Florida. The next night the same command captured a band of Yuchis, including their leader, Uchee Billy. General Jesup had King Phillip send a message to his son Coacoochee (Wild Cat) to arrange a meeting with Jesup. When Coacoochee arrived under a flag of truce, Jesup arrested him. In October Osceola and Coa Hadjo, another chief, requested a parley with Jesup. A meeting was arranged south of St. Augustine. When Osceola and Coa Hadjo arrived for the meeting, also under a white flag, they were arrested. Osceola was dead within three months of his capture, in prison at Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina. Not all of the Seminoles captured by the Army stayed captured. While Osceola was still held at Fort Marion (Castillo de San Marcos) in St. Augustine, twenty Seminoles held in the same cell with him and King Phillip escaped through a narrow window. The escapees included Coacoochee and John Horse, a Black Seminole leader. A delegation of Cherokees was sent to Florida to try to talk the Seminoles into moving west. When Micanopy and others came in to meet the Cherokees, General Jesup had the Seminoles held. John Ross, the head of the Cherokee delegation, protested, but to no avail. Jesup replied that he had told the Cherokees that no Seminole who came in would be allowed to return home. Zachary Taylor and the Battle of Lake Okeechobee. Jesup now had a large army assembled, including volunteers from as far away as Missouri and Pennsylvania—so many men, in fact, that he had trouble feeding all of them. Jesup's plan was to sweep down the peninsula with multiple columns, pushing the Seminoles further south. General Joseph Marion Hernández led a column down the east coast. General Eustis took his column up the St. Johns River (southward). Colonel Zachary Taylor led a column from Fort Brooke into the middle of the state, and then southward between the Kissimmee River and the Peace River. Other commands cleared out the areas between the St. Johns and the Oklawaha River, between the Oklawaha and the Withlacoochee River, and along the Caloosahatchee River. A joint Army-Navy unit patrolled the lower east coast of Florida. Other troops patrolled the northern part of the territory to protect against Seminole raids. Colonel Taylor saw the first major action of the campaign. Leaving Fort Gardiner on the upper Kissimmee with 1,000 men on December 19, Taylor headed towards Lake Okeechobee. In the first two days out ninety Seminoles surrendered. On the third day Taylor stopped to build Fort Basinger, where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles that had surrendered. Three days later, on Christmas Day, 1837, Taylor's column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee. The Seminoles led by Alligator, Sam Jones, and the recently escaped Coacoochee, were well positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered less than 400. Taylor sent the Missouri volunteers in first. Colonel Richard Gentry, three other officers and more than twenty enlisted men were killed before the volunteers retreated. Next in were 200 soldiers of the 6th Infantry, who lost four officers and suffered nearly 40% casualties before they withdrew. Then it was the turn of the 4th Infantry, 160 men augmented by remnants of the 6th Infantry and the Missouri volunteers. This time the troops were able to drive the Seminoles from the hammock and towards the lake. Taylor then attacked their flank with his reserves, but the Seminoles were able to escape across the lake. Only about a dozen Seminoles had been killed in the battle. Nevertheless, the Battle of Lake Okeechobee was hailed as a great victory for Taylor and the Army. The Battle of Loxahatchee. Taylor now joined the other columns sweeping down the peninsula to pass on the east side of Lake Okeechobee, under the overall command of General Jesup. The troops along the Caloosahatche River blocked any passage north on the west side of the lake. Still patrolling the east coast of Florida was the combined Army-Navy force under Navy Lt. Levin Powell. On January 15 Powell was leading eighty men towards a Seminole camp when they found themselves almost completely surrounded by a larger number of Seminoles. A charge against the Seminoles was unsuccessful, but the troops made it back to their boats after losing four dead and twenty-two wounded. (The party's retreat was covered by Army Lt. Joseph E. Johnston.) At the end of January Jesup's troops caught up with a large body of Seminoles to the east of Lake Okeechobee. The Seminoles were originally positioned in a hammock, but cannon and rocket fire drove them back across a wide stream (the Loxahatchee River), where they made another stand. The Seminoles eventually just faded away, having caused more casualties than they received, and the Battle of Loxahatchee was over. The fighting now died down. In February 1838 Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup with the proposition that they would stop fighting if they were allowed to stay south of Lake Okeechobee. Jesup favored the idea, foreseeing a long struggle to capture the remaining Seminoles in the Everglades, and calculating that the Seminoles would be easier to round up later when the land was actually needed by white settlers. However, Jesup had to write to Washington for approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply, and there was considerable fraternizing between the two camps. Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett rejected the arrangement, however, and instructed Jesup to continue his campaign. Upon receiving Poinsett's response, Jesup summoned the chiefs to his camp, but they refused his invitation. Unwilling to let 500 Seminoles return to the swamps, Jesup sent a force to detain them. The Seminoles offered very little resistance, perhaps seeing little reason to continue fighting. Loxahatchee River Battlefield Park preserves an area of the fighting. Memorials are also located in Jonathan Dickinson State Park. Jesup steps down; Zachary Taylor takes command. Jesup now asked to be relieved of his command. As summer approached in 1838 the number of troops in Florida dwindled to about 2,300. In April Jesup was informed that he should return to his position as Quartermaster General of the Army. In May Zachary Taylor, now a General, assumed command of the Army forces in Florida. With reduced forces in Florida, Taylor concentrated on keeping the Seminole out of northern Florida, so that settlers could return to their homes. The Seminole were still capable of reaching far north. In July they were thought responsible for the deaths of a family on the Santa Fe River, another near Tallahassee, as well as two families in Georgia. The fighting died down during the summer, as the soldiers were pulled back to the coasts. The Seminole concentrated on growing their crops and gathering supplies for fall and winter. Taylor's plan was to build small posts at frequent intervals across northern Florida, connected by wagon roads, and to use larger units to search designated areas. This was expensive, but Congress continued to appropriate the necessary funds. In October 1838, Taylor relocated the last of the Seminole living along the Apalachicola River to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Killings in the Tallahassee area caused Taylor to pull troops out of southern Florida to provide more protection in the north. The winter season was fairly quiet. The Army killed only a few Seminole and transported fewer than 200 to the West. Nine U.S. troops were killed by the Seminole. Taylor reported in the Spring of 1839 that his men had constructed 53 new posts and cut of wagon roads. Macomb's peace and the Harney Massacre. In Washington and around the country in 1839, support for the war was eroding. The size of the Army had been increased because of the demands for manpower in the Florida war. Many people were beginning to think that the Seminole had earned a right to stay in Florida. The cost and time required to get all the Seminole out of Florida were looming larger. Congress appropriated US$5,000 to negotiate a settlement with the Seminole people in order to end the outlay of resources. President Martin Van Buren sent the Commanding General of the Army, Alexander Macomb, to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminole. Remembering the broken treaties and promises of the past, they were slow to respond to the new overtures. Finally, Sam Jones sent his chosen successor, Chitto Tustenuggee, to meet with Macomb. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced reaching agreement with the Seminole. They would stop fighting in exchange for a reservation in southern Florida. As the summer passed, the agreement seemed to be holding. There were few killings. A trading post was established on the north shore of the Caloosahatchee River, and the Seminole who came to the trading post seemed to be friendly. A detachment of 23 soldiers was stationed at the Calooshatchee trading post under the command of Colonel William S. Harney. On July 23, 1839 some 150 Indians attacked the trading post and guard. Some of the soldiers, including Colonel Harney, were able to reach the river and find boats to escape in, but most of the soldiers, as well as a number of civilians in the trading post, were killed. The war was on again. The Americans did not know which band of Indians had attacked the trading post. Many blamed the 'Spanish' Indians, led by Chakaika. Some suspected Sam Jones, whose band of Mikasuki had come to agreement with Macomb. Jones promised to turn the men responsible for the attack over to Harney in 33 days. In the meantime, the Mikasuki in Sam Jones' camp near Fort Lauderdale remained on friendly terms with the local soldiers. On July 27 they invited the officers at the fort to a dance at the Mikasuki camp. The officers declined but sent two soldiers and a Black Seminole interpreter with a keg of whiskey. The Mikasuki killed the soldiers, but the Black Seminole escaped. He reported at the fort that Sam Jones and Chitto Tustenuggee were involved in the attack. In August 1839, Seminole raiding parties operated as far north as Fort White. New tactics. The Army decided to use bloodhounds to track the Seminole. (Although General Taylor had requested and received permission to buy bloodhounds in 1838, he had not done so.) In early 1840, the Florida territorial government purchased bloodhounds from Cuba and hired Cuban handlers. Initial trials of the hounds had mixed results, and a public outcry arose against the use of the dogs, based on fears that they would be set on the Seminole in physical attacks, including against women and children. The Secretary of War ordered the dogs to be muzzled and kept on leashes while tracking. As bloodhounds cannot track through water, the Seminole easily evaded the dogs. In the north of Florida, Taylor's blockhouse and patrol system kept the Seminole on the move, but the Army could not clear them from the area. Ambushes of travelers were common. On February 13, 1840 the mail stage between St. Augustine and Jacksonville was ambushed. In May Seminole attacked a theatrical troupe near St. Augustine, killing a total of six people. In the same month, a group of four soldiers traveling between forts in Alachua County was attacked, with one killed and two others never seen again. A party of eighteen men pursued the Indians, but six were killed.  In May 1840 Zachary Taylor, having served longer than any preceding commander in the Florida war, was granted his request for a transfer. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. Walker Keith Armistead, who had earlier served in Florida as second in command to General Jesup. Armistead began an offensive, sending out 100 soldiers at a time to search for the Seminole and their camps. For the first time, the Army campaigned in Florida during the summer, taking captives and destroying crops and buildings. The Seminole also were active in warfare, killing fourteen soldiers during July. The Army worked to find the Seminole camps, burn their fields and stores of food, and drive off their livestock, including their horses. Armistead planned to turn over the defense of Florida north of Fort King to the militia and volunteers. He wanted to use Army regulars to confine the Seminole to south of Fort King, and pursue them within that territory. The Army destroyed camps and fields across central Florida, a total of of Seminole crops by the middle of the summer. General Armistead became estranged from the territorial government, although he needed 1,500 militiamen from the Territory to defend the area north of Fort King. To bolster the effort south of Fort King, the Army sent the Eighth Infantry Regiment to Florida. The Army in Florida now included ten companies of the Second Dragoon, nine companies of the Third Artillery, and the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Infantry Regiments. Changes were also being made in southern Florida. At Fort Bankhead on Key Biscayne, Col. Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. The Navy took a larger role in the war, sending manned boats with sailors and marines up rivers and streams, and into the Everglades. The ""Mosquito Fleet"". In the early years of the war Navy Lt. Levin Powell had commanded a joint Army-Navy force of some 200 men that operated along the coast. In late 1839 Navy Lt. John T. McLaughlin was given command of a joint Army-Navy amphibious force to operate in Florida. This included schooners off shore and barges close to the mainland to intercept Cuban and Bahamian traders bringing arms and other supplies to the Seminoles, and smaller boats, down to canoes, for patrolling up rivers and into the Everglades. McLaughlin established his base at Tea Table Key in the upper Florida Keys. An attempt to cross the Everglades from west to east was launched in April 1840, but the sailors and marines were engaged by Seminoles at the rendezvous point on Cape Sable. Although there were no known fatalities (the Seminoles carried off their dead and wounded), many of the naval personnel became ill, and the expedition was called off and the sick were taken to Pensacola. For the next few months the men of Lt. McLaughlin's force explored the inlets and rivers of southern Florida. McLaughlin did lead a force across the Everglades later. Traveling from December 1840 to the middle of January 1841, McLaughlin's force crossed the Everglades from east to west in dugout canoes, the first groups of whites to complete a crossing. Indian Key. Indian Key is a small island in the upper Florida Keys which had developed into a base for wreckers. In 1836 it became the county seat of the newly created Dade County and a port of entry. Despite fears of attack and sightings of Indians in the area, the inhabitants of Indian Key stayed to protect their property, and to be close to any wrecks in the upper Keys. The islanders had six cannons and their own small militia company for their defense, and the Navy had established a base on nearby Tea Table Key. Early in the morning of August 7, 1840, a large party of 'Spanish' Indians sneaked onto Indian Key. By chance, one man was up and raised the alarm after spotting the Indians. Of about fifty people living on the island, forty were able to escape. The dead included Dr. Henry Perrine, former United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, who was waiting at Indian Key until it was safe to take up a grant on the mainland that Congress had awarded to him. The naval base on Tea Table Key had been stripped of personnel for an operation on the southwest coast of the mainland, leaving only a physician, his patients, and five sailors under a midshipman to look after them. This small contingent mounted a couple of cannons on barges and tried to attack the Indians on Indian Key. The Indians fired back at the sailors with musket balls loaded in one of the cannons on shore. The recoil of the cannons on the barges broke them loose, sending them into the water, and the sailors had to retreat. The Indians burned the buildings on Indian Key after thoroughly looting it. Revenge and negotiations. In December, 1840 Col. Harney finally got revenge for his humiliation on the Caloosahatchee River. He led ninety men into the Everglades from Fort Dallas on the Miami River, traveling in canoes borrowed from the Marines. They were guided by a black man named John who had been in Seminole captivity for a while. The column encountered some Indians in canoes and gave chase, catching some of them and promptly hanging the men. When John was having trouble finding the way, Harney tried to force the captured Seminole women to lead the way to the camp, reportedly by threatening to hang their children. However, John got his bearings again and the Harney party found the camp of Chakaika and the 'Spanish Indians'. Dressed as Indians, the soldiers approached the camp early in the morning, achieving surprise. Chakaika was outside the camp when the attack started. He started to run and then stopped and turned to face the soldiers, offering his hand, but one of the soldiers shot and killed him. There was a brief fight during which some of the Indians escaped. Harney had two of the captured warriors hanged, and had Chakaika's body hung beside them. Harney and his men returned to Fort Dallas after twelve days in the Everglades. Harney had lost one soldier killed. His command had killed four Indians in action and hanged five more. The Legislative Council of Florida presented Harney with a commendation and a sword, and Harney was soon given command of the Second Dragoons. Armistead had US$55,000 to use for bribing chiefs to surrender. In November 1840 Gen. Armistead had met at Fort King with Tiger Tail (Thlocklo Tustenuggee), a Muskogee speaker, and Halleck Tustenuggee, a Mikasuki speaker. Armistead was authorized by Washington to offer each leader $5,000 to bring their followers in for transportation west, and to concede land in the south of Florida to those remaining. However, Colonel Ethan A. Hitchcock recorded in his diary, with considerable frustration, that the General instead pocketed these proposals and insisted the chiefs agree to the terms of the Payne's Landing treaty. Moreover, while talking peace, he secretly sent a force threatening Halleck's people at his home. After several days as guests of the Army both chiefs fled in the middle of the night on November 14, 1840. Echo Emathla, a Tallahassee chief, surrendered, but most of the Tallahassee, under Tiger Tail, did not. The Mikasukis, led by Coosa Tustenuggee and Halleck Tustenuggee, continued to operate in the northern part of the Florida peninsula. Coosa Tustenuggee finally accepted US$5,000 for bringing in his sixty people. Lesser chiefs received US$200, and every warrior got US$30 and a rifle. Coacoochee took advantage of Armistead's willingness to negotiate. In March 1841 he agreed to bring in his followers in two or three months. During that time he appeared at several forts, presenting the pass given to him by Armistead, and demanding food and liquor. On one visit to Fort Pierce, Coacoochee demanded a horse to ride to Fort Brooke. The fort commander gave him one, along with five and one-half gallons of whiskey. By the Spring of 1841 Armistead had sent 450 Seminoles west. Another 236 were at Fort Brooke awaiting transportation. Armistead estimated that 120 warriors had been shipped west during his tenure, and that there were no more than 300 warriors left in Florida. In May 1841 Halleck Tustenuggee sent word that he would be bringing his band in to surrender. Colonel Worth takes charge. In May 1841 Armistead was replaced by Col. William Jenkins Worth as commander of Army forces in Florida. Due to the unpopularity of the war in the nation and in Congress, Worth had to cut back. The war was costing US$93,300 per month in addition to the pay of the regular soldiers. John T. Sprague, Worth's aide, believed that some civilians were trying to deliberately prolong the war in order to stay on the government payroll. Nearly 1,000 civilian employees of the Army were released, and smaller commands were consolidated. Worth then ordered his men out on what would now be called 'search and destroy' missions during the summer. These efforts effectively drove the Seminoles out of their old stronghold in the Cove of the Withlacoochee. Much of the rest of northern Florida was also cleared by these methods. On May 1, 1841 Lieutenant William Tecumseh Sherman was assigned to escort Coacoochee to a meeting at Fort Pierce. After washing and dressing in his best (which included a vest with a bullet hole and blood on it), Coacoochee asked Sherman to give him silver in exchange for a one-dollar bill from the Bank of Tallahassee. At the meeting Major Thomas Childs agreed to give Coacoochee thirty days to bring in his people for transportation west. Coacoochee's people came and went freely at the fort for the rest of the month, while Childs became convinced that Coachoochee would renege on his agreement. Childs asked for and received permission to seize Coacoochee. On June 4 he arrested Coachoochee and fifteen of his followers. Lieutenant Colonel William Gates ordered that Coacoochee and his men be shipped immediately to New Orleans. When Colonel Worth learned of this, he ordered the ship to return to Tampa Bay, as he intended to use Coacoochee to persuade the rest of the Seminoles to surrender. Colonel Worth offered bribes worth about US$8,000 to Coacoochee. As Coacoochee had no real hope of escaping, he agreed to send out messengers urging the Seminoles to move west. The chiefs still active in the northern part of the Florida peninsula, Halleck Tustenuggee, Tiger Tail, Nethlockemathla, and Octiarche, met in council and agreed to kill any messengers from the whites. The southern chiefs seemed to have learned of this decision, and supported it. However, when one messenger appeared at a council of Holata Mico, Sam Jones, Otulkethlocko, Hospetarke, Fuse Hadjo and Passacka, he was made prisoner, but not killed. A total of 211 Seminoles surrendered as a result of Coacoochee's messages, including most of his own band. Hospetarke was drawn into a meeting at Camp Ogden (near the mouth of the Peace River) in August and he and 127 of his band were captured. As the number of Seminoles in Florida decreased, it became easier for those left to stay hidden. In November the Third Artillery moved into the Big Cypress Swamp and burned a few villages. Some of the Seminoles in southern Florida gave up after that, and turned themselves in for transportation west. Seminoles were still scattered throughout most of Florida. One band that had been reduced to starvation surrendered in northern Florida near the Apalachicola River in 1842. Further east, however, bands led by Halpatter Tustenuggee, Halleck Tustenuggee and Chitto Harjo raided Mandarin and other settlements along the lower (i.e., northern) St. Johns River. On April 19, 1842, a column of 200 soldiers led by First Lieutenant George A. McCall found a group of Seminole warriors in the Pelchikaha Swamp, about thirty miles south of Fort King. There was a brief fire-fight and then the Seminoles disappeared into a hammock. Halleck Tustenuggee was held prisoner when he showed up at Fort King for a talk. Part of his band was caught when they visited the fort, and Lieutenant McCall captured the rest of Halleck's band in their camp. The war winds down. Colonel Worth recommended early in 1842 that the remaining Seminoles be left in peace if they would stay in southern Florida. Worth eventually received authorization to leave the remaining Seminoles on an informal reservation in southwestern Florida, and to declare an end to the war on a date of his choosing. At this time there were still several diverse bands of Indians in Florida. Billy Bowlegs was the head of a large band of Seminoles living near Charlotte Harbor. Sam Jones led a band of Mikasukis that lived in the Everglades near Fort Lauderdale. North of Lake Okeechobee was a band of Muskogees led by Chipco. Another Muskogee band, led by Tiger Tail, lived near Tallahassee. Finally, in northern Florida there was a band of Creeks led by Octiarche which had fled from Georgia in 1836. In August 1842 Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act, which provided free land to settlers who improved the land and were prepared to defend themselves from Indians. In many ways this act prefigured the Homestead Act of 1862. Heads of households could claim of land south of a line running across the northern part of the peninsula. They had to 'prove' their claim by living on the land for five years and clearing . However, they could not claim land within two miles (3 km) of a military post. A total of 1,317 grants totaling were registered in 1842 and 1843. In the last action of the war, General William Bailey and prominent planter Jack Bellamy led a posse of 52 men on a three day pursuit of a small band of Tiger Tail's braves who had been attacking pioneers, surprising their swampy encampment and killing all 24. William Wesley Hankins, at sixteen the youngest of the posse, accounted for the last of the kills and was acknowledged as having fired the last shot of the Second Seminole War. Also in August 1842 Worth met with the chiefs still in Florida. Each warrior was offered a rifle, money and one year's worth of rations if they moved west. Some accepted the offer, but most hoped to eventually move to the reservation in southwest Florida. Believing that the remaining Indians in Florida would either go west or move to the reservation, Worth declared the war to be at an end on August 14, 1842. Worth then went on ninety-days leave, leaving command to Colonel Josiah Vose. The Army in Florida consisted at this point of parts of three regiments, totaling 1,890 men. Attacks on white settlers continued even as far north as the area around Tallahassee. Otiarche and Tiger Tail had not indicated what they would do. Complaints from Florida caused the War Department to order Vose to take action against the bands still off the reservation, but Vose argued that breaking the pledges made to the Indians would have bad results, and the War Department accepted his arguments. In early October a major hurricane struck Cedar Key, where the Army headquarters had been located, and the Indians would no longer visit it. Worth returned to Florida at the beginning of November 1842. He soon decided that Tiger Tail and Otiarche had taken too long to make up their minds on what to do, and ordered that they be brought in. Tiger Tail was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter, and he died in New Orleans waiting for transportation to the Indian territory. The other Indians in northern Florida were also captured and sent west. By April 1843 only one regiment, the Eighth Infantry, was still in Florida. In November 1843 Worth reported that the only Indians left in Florida were 42 Seminole warriors, 33 Mikasukis, 10 Creeks and 10 Tallahassees, with women and children bringing the total to about 300. Worth also stated that these Indians were all living on the reservation and were no longer a threat to the white population of Florida. Costs. Mahon cites estimates of US$30,000,000 to $40,000,000 as the cost of the Second Seminole War, but knew of no analysis of the actual cost. Congress appropriated funds for the 'suppression of Indian hostilities', but the costs of the Creek War of 1836 are included in that. An inquiry in extravagance in naval operations found that the Navy had spent about US$511,000 on the war. The investigation did find questionable expenditures. Among other things, while the Army had bought dugout canoes for $10 to $15 apiece, the Navy spent an average of $226 per canoe. The number of Army, Navy and Marine regulars who served in Florida is given as 10,169. About 30,000 militiamen and volunteers also served in the war. Sources agree that the U.S. Army officially recorded 1,466 deaths in the Second Seminole War, mostly from disease. The number killed in action is less clear. Mahon reports 328 regular Army killed in action, while Missall reports that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men. Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade Massacre, Battle of Lake Okeechobee and Harney Massacre. Similarly, Mahon reports 69 deaths for the Navy while Missal reports 41 for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, but adds others may have died after being sent out of Florida as ""incurable"". Mahon and the Florida Board of State Institutions agree that 55 volunteer officers and men were killed by the Seminoles, while Missall says the number is unknown. There is no figure for how many militiamen and volunteers died of disease or accident, however.  The number of white civilians, Seminoles and Black Seminoles killed is uncertain. A northern newspaper carried a report that more than 80 civilians were killed by Indians in Florida in 1839. Nobody was keeping a cumulative account of the number of Indians and Black Seminoles killed, or the number who died of starvation or other privations caused by the war. The people shipped west did not fare well, either. By the end of 1843 3,824 Indians (including 800 Black Seminoles) had been shipped from Florida to what became the Indian Territory. They were initially settled on the Creek Reservation, which created tensions. The next year, the Florida people numbered 3,136. As of 1862, their numbers had dropped to 2,343 Seminoles in the Indian Territory. After the war. Peace had come to Florida for a while. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation, but there were minor clashes. The Florida authorities continued to press for removal of all Indians from Florida. The Indians for their part tried to limit their contacts with whites as much as possible. As time went on there were more serious incidents. The government resolved once more to remove all Indians from Florida, and applied increasing pressure on the Seminoles until they struck back, starting the Third Seminole War of 1855-1858. "
wikipedia-365700," Brethren of the Common Life  The Brethren of the Common Life (Latin: Fratres Vitae Communis) (FVC) was a Roman Catholic pietist religious community founded in the Netherlands in the 14th century by Gerard Groote, formerly a successful and worldly educator who had had a religious experience and preached a life of simple devotion to Jesus Christ. Without taking up irrevocable vows, the Brethren banded together in communities, giving up their worldly goods to live chaste and strictly regulated lives in common houses, devoting every waking hour to attending divine service, reading and preaching of sermons, labouring productively, and taking meals in common that were accompanied by the reading aloud of Scripture: ""judged from the ascetic discipline and intention of this life, it had few features which distinguished it from life in a monastery"", observes Hans Baron. Gerard Groote. Of wealthy burgher stock, Groote was born at Deventer in Gelderland in 1340. Having read at Cologne, at the Sorbonne, and at Prague, he took orders and obtained preferment — a canon's stall at Utrecht and another at Aachen. His relations with the German Gottesfreunde and the writings of Ruysbroek, who later became his friend, gradually inclined him to mysticism, and on recovering from an illness in 1373 he resigned his prebends, bestowed his goods on the Carthusians of Arnheim, and lived in solitude for seven years. Feeling himself constrained to go forth and preach, Groote went from place to place calling men to repentance, proclaiming the beauty of Divine love, and bewailing the relaxation of ecclesiastical discipline and the degradation of the clergy. The effect of his sermons was marvellous; thousands hung on his words.  Brethren of the Common Life. A small band of followers attached themselves to Groote and became his fellow-workers, thus becoming the first ""Brethren of the Common Life"" (). The reformer was opposed by the clergy, whose lax lives he denounced in his preaching as decadent and evil, but his zeal for purifying the Catholic faith and the morality of its followers won many to his cause. Members of the secular clergy even enrolled themselves in his brotherhood, which in due course was approved by the Pope.  The majority of the Brethren were laymen who did not take monastic vows. They devoted themselves to doing charitable work, nursing the sick, studying and teaching the Scriptures, and copying religious and inspirational works. They founded a number of schools that became famous for their high standards of learning. Many famous men attended their schools, including Nicholas of Cusa, Thomas á Kempis, and Erasmus, all of whom studied at the Brethren's school at Deventer.  Devotio Moderna. The Brethren's confraternity is the best known fruits of the ""Devotio Moderna"", (the Modern Devotion), an undogmatic form of piety which some historians have argued helped to pave the road for the Protestant Reformation. In the fifteenth century, the movement spread to southern and western Germany. Windesheim Congregation. Groote, however, did not live long enough to finish the work he had begun. He died in 1384, and was succeeded by Florens Radewyns, who two years later refounded the famous monastery of Augustinian canons at Windesheim, near Zwolle, which was thenceforth the centre of the new association. Education and activity. The Confraternity of the Common Life were in many ways similar to the Beghard and Beguine communities which had flourished two centuries earlier but were by then declining. Its members took no vows, neither asked nor received alms; their first aim was to cultivate the interior life, and they worked for their daily bread. Books and the library were central to the communities of Brethren, whose scrupulous copies of works of piety supported their houses and put the texts in which they found spiritual sustenance in many hands. The houses of the brothers and sisters occupied themselves with literature and education, and their priests also with preaching. When Groote began, education in the Netherlands was still rare, contrary to the situation in Italy and the southern parts of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the University of Leme of the schools of Liège was only a vague memory. Apart from some of the clergy who had studied at the universities and cathedral schools in Paris or in Cologne, there were few scholars in the land; even amongst the higher clergy there were many who were ignorant of the scientific study of Latin, and the ordinary burgher of the Dutch cities was quite content if, when his children left school, they were able to read and write the Medieval Low German and Diets.  Groote determined to change all this. The Brethren worked consistently in the scriptorium; afterwards, with the printing press, they were able to publish their spiritual writings widely. Amongst them are to be found the best works of 15th-century Flemish prose. The Brethren spared no pains to obtain good masters, if necessary from foreign countries, for their schools, which became centres of spiritual and intellectual life of the Catholic Church; amongst those whom they trained or who were associated with them were men like Thomas à Kempis, Dierick Maertens, Gabriel Biel, Jan Standonck (1454–1504), priest and reformer, Master of the Collège de Montaigu in Paris, and the Dutch Pope Adrian VI.  Martin Luther studied under the Brethren of the Common Life at Magdeburg before going on to the University of Erfurt. Another famous member of the Brethren of the Common Life was Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. His mystical and scholarly efforts produced many works of literature. One of his greatest contributions to the Christian faith was a critical Greek New Testament (1514) which challenged the previous New Testament text translations (specifically the Vulgate). Commonly called Erasmus, he embraced ecclesiastical structure yet challenged the Augustinian view (people do not choose God, but God is the only one who brings people into grace and salvation), the nature of the human will, and the corruption and problems of the late medieval church. Through the trade connections of the Dutch Hanseatic cities Deventer and Zwolle the ideas of the Modern devotion spread over the whole of the Hanseatic trade area. Before the fifteenth century closed, the Brethren of the Common Life had placed in all Germany and the Netherlands schools in which teaching was offered ""for the love of God alone.""  Gradually the course of study, at first elementary, embraced the humanities, philosophy, and theology. The religious orders were not impressed, as the Brethren were neither monks nor friars, but they were protected by Popes Eugene IV, Pius II, and Sixtus IV. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa had been their pupil and so became their staunch protector and benefactor. He was also the patron of Rudolph Agricola (Rudolf de Boer), who in his youth at Zwolle had studied under Thomas à Kempis; and through this connection the Brethren of the Common Life, through Cusa and Agricola, influenced Erasmus and other adepts in the New Learning. More than half of the crowded schools — in 1500, Deventer had over two thousand students — were swept away in the religious troubles of the sixteenth century. Others languished until the French Revolution, while the rise of universities, the creation of diocesan seminaries, and the competition of new teaching orders gradually extinguished the schools that regarded Deventer and Windesheim as their parent establishments. Lutheran community in Herford. The community of the Brethren in Herford went over bodily to the Reformation, But despite of it, the local council threatened to close their house. The Brethren wrote to Martin Luther 1532, who defended their community life by writing to the council of the city. To Jacob Montanus and Gerhard Wilskamp he wrote in the end of January 1532: """"Your way of life, since you teach and live according to the Gospel, pleases me no end"""". If only """"there had been, and today there were more convents like yours!...Abide by your way of life and use it to spread the Gospel (as you do)!"""" The house of the Brethren of the Common Life in Herford remained in existence as a Lutheran brotherhood until 1841. Further reading.

wikipedia-365705," Bob Edwards  Robert Alan Edwards (born May 16, 1947 in Louisville, Kentucky) is a Peabody Award-winning member of the National Radio Hall of Fame. He was the first broadcaster with a large national following to join the field of satellite radio. Edwards is the host of ""The Bob Edwards Show"" on Sirius XM Radio and ""Bob Edwards Weekend"" distributed by Public Radio International to more than 150 public radio stations. He gained fame as the first host of National Public Radio's flagship program, ""Morning Edition"". Personal life and early career. Edwards is a graduate of St. Xavier High School (Louisville) and the University of Louisville and began his radio career in 1968 at a small radio station in New Albany, Indiana. Afterwards, Edwards served in the U.S. Army, producing and anchoring TV and radio news programs for the American Forces Korea Network from Seoul. Following his army service, he went on to anchor news for WTOP/1500, a CBS affiliate, in Washington, D.C. He also earned an M.A. in Communication from American University in Washington D.C. In 1972, at age 25, Edwards anchored national newscasts for the Mutual Broadcasting System. Edwards joined NPR in 1974. Before hosting ""Morning Edition"", Edwards was co-host of ""All Things Considered"". Edwards is married to NPR news anchor Windsor Johnston. He has two daughters, Eleanor and Susannah, and a stepson, Brean Campbell. Host of ""Morning Edition"". Edwards hosted NPR's flagship program, ""Morning Edition"", from the show's inception in 1979 until 2004. After 24-plus years with Edwards as host, Arbitron ratings showed that, with 13 million listeners, it was the second highest-rated radio broadcast in the country, behind only Rush Limbaugh's AM show. Prior to his departure, he was very popular among both listeners and critics.  When ""Morning Edition"" and its host won a George Foster Peabody Award in 1999, the Peabody committee lauded Edwards as  Edwards' skills as an interviewer have been widely praised. NPR's ombudsman Jeffery Dvorkin said, ""If I were his producer, I would think of Edwards as NPR's version of Charlie Rose."" The New York Daily News called him ""an institution among ""Morning Edition"" listeners for his interviewing skills and his calm, articulate style."" It is estimated that Edwards conducted over 20,000 interviews for NPR. His subjects ranged from major politicians to authors and celebrities. His weekly call-in chats with retired sportscaster Red Barber are fondly remembered. The chats were supposedly about sports, but often digressed into topics like the Gulf War, what kind of flowers were blooming at Barber's Tallahassee, Florida home, or other non-sport subjects. Barber would call Edwards ""Colonel Bob,"" referring to Edwards' Kentucky Colonel honor from his native state. Barber died in 1992, and the following year Edwards based his first book, ""Fridays with Red: A Radio Friendship"" (ISBN 0-671-87013-0), on the weekly interviews.  In 2003, Edwards was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Controversial departure from NPR. In April 2004, NPR executives decided to ""freshen up"" ""Morning Edition""'s sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, and reassigned as a senior correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. ""I'd rather stay,"" he said, ""but it's not my decision to make."" At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused. Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, ""It’s part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bob's voice will still be heard; he’ll still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt it was time for a change."" Executive Vice President Ken Stern also explained the move. ""This change in ""Morning Edition"" is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. We've looked at shows like ""All Things Considered"" and ""Talk of the Nation"" with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future."" Stern later participated in an online chat with listeners at NPR's website, but only heightened their confusion and anger.  The decision to remove Edwards, made shortly before his 25th anniversary with the show, was met with much criticism by listeners. Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR's ombudsman, reported that the network received over 50,000 letters and emails regarding Edwards' demotion, most of them angry. This is the largest reaction to one subject NPR has ever received. Other journalists, including ABC's Cokie Roberts and CBS' Charles Osgood, expressed dissatisfaction with the move.  His final broadcast as the host was on April 30, 2004; his last '""Morning Edition"" interview was with Charles Osgood, who had also been Edwards' first Morning Edition interview subject almost 25 years earlier. Coincidentally, the last show also included a segment about the last Oldsmobile, which rolled off an assembly line the day before.  During his final months at NPR, Edwards wrote his second book, ""Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism"" (ISBN 0-471-47753-2), published in May 2004. The book, a short biography of Edward R. Murrow, brought some public attention to history's most noted broadcast journalist prior to the release of the 2004 film ""Good Night and Good Luck"". NPR removed Edwards from ""Morning Edition"" that spring, rather than waiting for his 25th anniversary with the show in the fall, using the book tour to make a ""clean break,"" rather than bringing him back for a final three-month stint.  Edwards decided not to remain at NPR as a senior correspondent, and filed only one story in that role (an interview with Bob Dole and other Senate veterans of World War II about the Washington, DC World War II memorial). Three months after his departure from ""Morning Edition"", XM Satellite Radio announced that he had signed on to host a new program, ""The Bob Edwards Show"", for its new XM Public Radio channel. His memoir, A Voice in the Box, was published in September 2011. Sirius XM Satellite Radio career. ""They want to give me a program, so I can continue to host and be heard every day instead of occasionally, as I would have been at NPR,"" Edwards told the ""Washington Post"". He said the format would be ""loose"": ""It'll be long interviews, short interviews, and then maybe departments... You've got to have the news... it's not going to be all features, yet it's not going to be the ""Financial Times"", either."" ""The Bob Edwards Show""'s first broadcast was on October 4, 2004. Washington Post columnist David Broder and former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite were Edwards' first guests. While continuing his daily show on XM, Edwards returned to public radio stations in January 2006 with his show ""Bob Edwards Weekend"", produced by XM Satellite Radio and distributed by Public Radio International to affiliate stations around the country. A September 22, 2005 press release from PRI states, """"Bob Edwards Weekend"" will provide PRI listeners with an opportunity to sample some of the astute commentary and intriguing interviews offered to XM subscribers each weekday on ""The Bob Edwards Show""."" This was the first time that a satellite radio company provided programming to over-the-air terrestrial radio.  ""Bob Edwards Weekend"" episodes are no longer available via podcast at BobEdwardsRadio.com.  Visitors to the page http://www.bobedwardsradio.com/ways-to-listen/ will see the message ""The Bob Edwards Weekend podcast is no longer available. Our sincerest apologies to our devoted listeners."" In 2006, ""The Bob Edwards Show"" received ""The Deems Taylor Award"" from ""ASCAP"". In 2006, Bob's program received a Gabriel Award from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals. In 2007, the show received the National Press Club's Robert L. Kozic Award for Environmental Reporting for the documentary, ""Exploding Heritage,"" about mountaintop-removal coal mining. That program was also honored with a Gabriel Award, a 2006 New York Festivals Gold World Medal, and an award from the Society of Environmental Journalists. In 2008, ""The Bob Edwards Show"" received an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association and a New York Festivals/United Nations Gold Award for the documentary, ""The Invisible--Children Without Homes."" ""The Invisible"" also was honored by the Journalism Center for Children and Families and by the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals. In 2009, the show received a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for the documentary, ""Stories from Third Med: Surviving a Jungle ER."" The documentary also received a Gabriel Award. In September, 2012, Edwards was named a Fellow of the Society of Professional Journalists. In 2013, Bob's program was awarded a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the documentary, ""An Occupational Hazard: Rape in the Military."" Subscriptions to and individual episodes of ""The Bob Edwards Show"" are available for a fee at Audible.com. Professional life. In November 2004, Edwards was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. He continues to offer verbal support for National Public Radio and helps local public radio stations with their fundraisers.  Edwards serves on the board of trustees of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and is a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute, SAG-AFTRA and the Homeless Children's Playtime Project.  He holds honorary degrees from the University of Louisville, Spalding University, Bellarmine University, Willamette University, Grinnell College, DePaul University, the University of St. Francis and Albertson College (now the College of Idaho).

wikipedia-365715," Timothy Gowers  Sir William Timothy Gowers, FRS (; born 20 November 1963) is a British mathematician. He is a Royal Society Research Professor at the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge, where he also holds the Rouse Ball chair, and is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1998 he received the Fields Medal for research connecting the fields of functional analysis and combinatorics. Education. Gowers attended King's College School, Cambridge as a choirboy in the King's College choir, and then Eton College as a King's Scholar. He completed his Ph.D., with a dissertation entitled ""Symmetric Structures in Banach Spaces,"" at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1990, supervised by Béla Bollobás. Academic Work. Between 1991 and 1995 he was a member of the Department of Mathematics at University College London. He used combinatorial tools in proving several of Stefan Banach's conjectures on Banach spaces and in constructing a Banach space with almost no symmetry, serving as a counterexample to several other conjectures. With Bernard Maurey he resolved the ""unconditional basic sequence problem"" in 1992, showing that not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an infinite-dimensional subspace that admits an unconditional Schauder basis. His proof of Szemerédi's theorem by Fourier-analytic methods has also been influential. He has worked in combinatorics, particularly on regularity for graphs and hypergraphs. Honours. In 1996 he received the Prize of the European Mathematical Society, and in 1998 the Fields Medal for research on functional analysis and combinatorics. In 1999 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2012 was knighted by the British monarch for services to mathematics He also sits on the selection committee for the Mathematics award, given under the auspices of the Shaw Prize. Popularization Work. Gowers has written several works popularizing mathematics, including ""Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction"" (2002), which describes modern mathematical research for the general reader. He was consulted about the 2005 film ""Proof"", starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins. Recently, he has edited ""The Princeton Companion to Mathematics"" (2008), which traces the development of various branches and concepts of modern mathematics. For his work on this book, he won the 2011 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America. Blogging. After asking on his blog whether ""massively collaborative mathematics"" was possible, he solicited comments on his blog from people who wanted to try to solve mathematical problems collaboratively. The first problem in what is called the Polymath Project, Polymath1, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the Hales–Jewett theorem. After 7 weeks, Gowers wrote on his blog that the problem was ""probably solved"". In 2009, with Olof Sisask and Alex Frolkin, he invited people to post comments to his blog to contribute to a collection of methods of mathematical problem solving Contributors to this Wikipedia-style project, called Tricki.org, include Terence Tao and Ben Green  In 2012, Gowers posted to his blog to call for a boycott of the publishing house Elsevier. A petition ensued, branded the Cost of Knowledge project, in which researchers commit to stop supporting Elsevier journals. Commenting on the petition in The Guardian, Alok Jha credited Gowers with starting an Academic Spring. Family relations and personal life. His father is composer Patrick Gowers, and his great-grandfather was British civil servant Sir Ernest Gowers (best known for guides to English usage) who was son of neurologist Sir William Gowers. He has five children and plays jazz piano. In November 2012 he opted to undergo catheter ablation to treat a sporadic atrial fibrillation, after performing a mathematical risk-benefit analysis to decide whether to have the treatment. "
wikipedia-365729," Houston Museum District  The Houston Museum District is an association of museums, galleries, cultural centers and community organizations located in Houston, Texas, dedicated to promoting the arts, sciences, and cultural amenities of the area. The Houston Museum District currently includes 19 museums that recorded a collective attendance of over 7 million in 2011. All of the museums offer hours with free admission, and 12 of the museums are free all the time. Bordered roughly by Rice University, the Neartown area and Texas Medical Center, the Museum District specifically refers to the area located within a 1.5-mile radius of the Mecom Fountain in Hermann Park. The Museum District is served by four stops on the METRORail, one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from US 59, State Highway 288 and Main Street. The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-80s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter. Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997. The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world. History. In the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists. The Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the Museum of Fine Arts, at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core. In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the United States without zoning, this was fairly progressive. The Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between Allen Parkway, Buffalo Bayou and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the French Quarter in New Orleans, St. Germain in Paris, and Georgetown in Washington, DC. Since its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events The Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District. Founding members. According to 1st board meeting notes (Oct 4, 1986): Directors: Current museum members. Parks and other institutions Funding. Originally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members’ donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources. Today, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.; The John P. McGovern Foundation; The Wortham Foundation, Inc.; The Brown Foundation, Inc.; Susan Vaughan Foundation, Inc.; and corporate support from KHOU-TV Channel 11, KUHT-TV (PBS), the ""Houston Chronicle"", ""Texas Monthly"", Exxon, and Cadillac. Programs. Museum District Day. During the annual Museum District Day, museums offer free general admission and shuttle service for visitors in order to raise awareness of the District. In 2009, there were seventeen participating museums with over 66,000 visits. Museum District Day 2012 is Scheduled for Saturday, September 15. Educators Open House. Each year, museums in the District host an open house for area teachers (public, private and home-school teachers) to experience the museums and learn about school programs available at the museums. Teachers receive continuing education credits for attending the 3 one hour presentations & prize drawings. Museum Educators Open House 2010 is scheduled for Saturday, January 23. Cultural collaborations. The District has taken a leadership role in seeking collaborative opportunities with the Theater District, Miller Outdoor Theatre, the reorganized Houston Arts Alliance and city-wide cultural organizations to foster greater public awareness of Houston’s cultural attractions. Public issues. The District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations. The HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area. Leadership. Laurette Canizares, Executive Director, Houston Museum District Association  Jarrod Gullett, Office Manager, Houston Museum District Association  Education. The Houston Public Library Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the Julia Ideson Building in Downtown Houston, moved to the William Clayton Home, a Georgian-style house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986. The new building, which was built in 1988, was designed to complement the Clayton Home. The city implemented a $6.8 million renovation project for the Clayton Home and the guest house and carriage house on the property in the 2000s. The city planned to renovate the property so it would meet LEED standards. The city installed an elevator in the guest house so the building could be used as an administrative office. The carriage house received an addition so it could function as a 100 person conference room. The Clayton site can accommodate one plenary session and four breakout meetings, which would be required for a national genealogical conference. The ""Houston Business Journal"" awarded the renovation as the best historic renovation for its 2009 Landmark Awards. "
wikipedia-365730," Don Valley Parkway  The Don Valley Parkway (DVP) is a controlled-access six-lane municipal expressway in Toronto connecting the Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto with Ontario Highway 401, the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway. North of Highway 401, it continues as Ontario Highway 404. The parkway runs through the parklands of the Don River Valley, after which it is named. The parkway has a maximum speed limit of for its entire length of . As a municipal road, it is patrolled by the Toronto Police Service. The parkway was the second expressway to be built by Metropolitan Toronto (Metro). Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new alignment through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401. The parkway operates well beyond its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day and is known for daily traffic jams; some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day. Planned as part of a larger expressway network within Toronto, it was one of the few expressways built before the public opposition which cancelled many of the others. Route description. The Don Valley Parkway begins at an interchange with the Gardiner Expressway near the mouth of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the park lands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway 401. South of the Forks. At its southern end near the mouth of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection. Less than north of the Gardiner, the Canadian National (CNR)/GO Toronto railway viaduct passes over the parkway. The interchange is constrained by that distance for the Gardiner – Don Valley two-lane ramps bridge the difference in height from ground-level under the viaduct with the height of the Gardiner. Acceleration and deceleration lanes for the Lake Shore – Don Valley ramps connect under the viaduct. From the viaduct, the parkway proceeds north as a four-lane highway on a straight course along the east bank of the channelized Don River, passing beneath Eastern Avenue and veering slightly to the east as it passes below Queen Street East. On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each adding a lane to both carriageways. The expressway continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between the highway and Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the elevation of the highway is close to the level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example. North from Riverdale Park, the valley widens considerably. The expressway rises from the floor of the valley and passes beneath the towering Prince Edward Viaduct bridge, which connects Bloor Street with Danforth Avenue and carries a subway line. The highway runs along the eastern wall of the valley for the next several kilometres, rising and dipping repeatedly. The expressway curves eastward into a cut in the hillside as it passes the 'Half-mile' railway bridge. Immediately to the north, it meets the Bayview Avenue – Bloor Street interchange. The long off-ramp to these roads was the original southern terminus of the parkway in 1961. The off-ramp was later proposed as the eastern terminus of the proposed Crosstown Expressway. This expressway, opposed by the City of Toronto, was never built: it was intended for construction only after the completion of the Spadina Expressway, which itself was cancelled in 1971. Just north of the Bayview–Bloor interchange, the expressway passes over Pottery Road. To the east is Todmorden Mills, a collection of historic buildings and a former industrial site, the original ""Don Mills"". The nearby pond was a section of the Don River cut off by the parkway construction. Further north, to the west where the highway crosses Beechwood Avenue, is Crothers' Woods, a restoration site. The expressway continues due east along the southern edge of the valley. The opposing lanes split as the expressway passes beneath the Leaside Viaduct, the southbound lanes at a lower level. The lanes rejoin as they approach the Don Mills Road interchange at the ""forks of the Don"". Just east of the Don Mills Road interchange, several large white sculptures resembling human teeth are installed on both sides of the road. The sculptures, called ""The Elevated Wetlands"", are examples of ""eco-art"" and have become a landmark. The sculptures resemble concrete but are made of plastic and filled with waste plastic and wetland plants. The sculptures function as a water filter, removing pollutants from the Don River. A solar-powered pump lifts water to the top of the sculpture and it is returned to the Don after filtration. The sculptures were installed in 1998 and the wetland plants added in 1999. North to Highway 401. The expressway crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, and climbs out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange. As it crosses Eglinton, the expressway passes a business park to the west and the Concorde Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/Richmond Hill GO line) before reaching Lawrence Avenue East, one of the few remaining cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario. This area, known as Milne Hollow, is partially forested, some of the land being conservation reserve. Passing beneath Lawrence and back over the East Don River, the expressway begins climbing out of the valley once more. It reaches the top of the valley and curves along a plateau before passing over York Mills Road. Residential sub-divisions are present along both sides of the road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to the Highway 401 interchange. After rising to meet the interchange, it widens to four lanes and splits into two branches: two lanes continuing north as Highway 404, and the three others as Highway 401. The entire length of the parkway uses the RESCU Traffic Management System, which was installed in 1994. Like the similar COMPASS system on provincial freeways, RESCU combines in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures. The system is used as a means of managing traffic flow along the parkway. The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and smog alerts. The RESCU Traffic Cameras are located at regular intervals along the parkway. The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The cameras are located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway. Most have one camera for northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports. Traffic congestion. The Don Valley Parkway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest municipal routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned as one of a series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west. By the early 1980s, traffic volumes on the parkway exceeded capacity, and today, the parkway has significant traffic congestion on most days. During the morning commute, commuters fill the southbound lanes as far south as Bloor Street. In the afternoon/evening commute, commuters fill the northbound lanes from Bloor Street, and often the full length of the highway in event of a collision or other hazard. The daily congestion has earned the highway the quasi-affectionate nickname of the ""Don Valley Parking Lot"". The section immediately south of Highway 401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the number of lanes merging from Highways 401 and 404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway 401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway 401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway 404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it. History. The construction of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both near the mouth of the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The construction of the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards. Conditions before construction. The Don River valley, formed during the last ice age, has played an important role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks. North of Bloor Street, the wide valley floor became dominated by industrial concerns of the Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton spent much of his youth in the 1870s studying animal life. The Don Valley Parkway was not the first highway planned through the valley. In the 1930s, a ""speedway"" through the lower valley was promoted as possible depression relief. Unlike today's parkway, this road would have curved northwest near the Don Valley Brick Works and connected to Mount Pleasant at Davisville. The city did not have the money and appealed to 'civic-minded citizens' to donate the land on which the highway would be built. None came forward. In 1939, city transportation planner Norman Wilson proposed a boulevard that would follow the valley into the northeast. On January 1, 1946, Toronto voters approved the building of a 'Don Valley Traffic Artery' following the same route as the ""speedway"" by a vote of 31,882 to 12,328. This was the same plebiscite where Toronto voters approved the construction of the Yonge Subway. The City then borrowed $1.5 million to finance the project. In 1949, the Official Plan of the City of Toronto updated the Don Valley Roadway plan to include two branches - one to the north-west which would eventually become the Crosstown Expressway proposal, and one to the north-east leading to O'Connor Drive. The original plan to connect to St. Clair remained. East York Township opposed construction of the north-east roadway. The City started the first section of this route from Eastern Avenue south to Keating Street in 1949, but had to suspend work in 1951 due to a lack of steel.  Recognizing the value of the natural spaces of the valley, conservationists such as Charles Sauriol founded the Don Valley Conservation Association, in 1948 to assist the provincial Don Valley Conservation Authority (DVCA) itself founded in 1946. The Association promoted conservation of the valley with rail tours and public events. In 1951, the Ontario Department of Planning and Development released its ""Don Valley Conservation Report"", which recommended the preservation of the valley, including an artificial reservoir where Lawrence Avenue crossed the Don River. It also proposed that the valley not be used for any new major transportation routes. The DVCA adopted the report and budgeted to buy lands in the valley, but the City of Toronto withheld funding to the DVCA for land purchases. In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) federation was approved and Fred Gardiner was named as its first chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T&Y Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that would be needed to put the highway through. ""We'll move the railway over a piece. We'll tear down the hill. We'll shift the river over a piece, then we can have the highway through there."" Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city's expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic Grand Central Parkway, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them. The first Metro staff survey and feasibility study of the parkway's route was approved in late 1953, before the Metro government itself came into being in 1954. In October 1954, flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel caused the destruction of bridges and buildings in the valley. As a consequence of the destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, was one of the few to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted ""I'll tell you what the Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that's what it was."" Construction. The design of the project was contracted to the engineering consortium of Fenco-Harris, which completed the plans in the fall of 1955. The project included extending Bayview Avenue south along the Lower Don valley, which replaced the 'north' arm of the previous Don Valley roadway project, and the realignment of Lawrence Avenue over the East Don River. The design for the section north of the Don River mouth incorporated the existing river-side Don Roadway on the east side of the River. The design also incorporated a section of the old Don Mills Road leading up from the River, north of Gerrard, to Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue into the highway as a northbound on-ramp from Danforth. The project was designed to carry 60,000 vehicles per day. Fenco-Harris designed the route to be ""located on public lands as much as possible, thus minimizing the expropriation of private property. Greenbelt land has been used for right-of-way in preference to acreage which can be commercially developed."" The route required the expropriation of less than 25 properties. The first planned route of the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and continuing along the Don Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway 401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of the Don Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment. The plan, estimated to cost C$28.674 million, was approved by Metro Council in early 1956. Formal approval to build came in 1958 and construction of the parkway began. A stumbling block to construction was resolved by a deal between Metro and the City of Toronto over City-owned parklands needed for the parkway. North of Bloor Street, of City-owned land would be transferred to Metro and any lands not needed for the parkway would be developed as parks by Metro. South of Bloor Street, Metro agreed to replace any recreation facilities lost in Riverdale Park due to the parkway construction. The City had threatened to not allow construction through City-owned land. The first section of the parkway, from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, was opened on August 31, 1961, by Ontario Premier Leslie Frost and Metro chairman Gardiner, who presented Frost with a silver plate. It opened initially without an interchange at Don Mills Road and had its first traffic jam that day at the Eglinton Avenue exit. The interchange at Don Mills was approved by Metro council on November 2, 1964. Building the section within the valley required significant civil engineering, including the rerouting of of the Don River, installation of of reinforced retaining wall and the removal of two hills. Tumper's Hill, located near the Don Mills Road interchange, stood higher than it does today. Sugar Loaf Hill, shaped like a cone, which stood alone in the shadow of the Prince Edward Viaduct where Bayview Avenue passes today, was removed completely. The of earth was used as fill for the parkway and a total of of earth was excavated and moved. Besides modification of the natural landscape, the route required relocation and demolition of utilities and residences. Metro relocated of CNR and CPR railway tracks in the section from Bloor Street to Chester Hill Road to make way for the parkway. The Todmorden sewage treatment plant, built in 1926, was also demolished. The route required the removal of five homes on Minton Place located above the valley to facilitate the cut of the valley hillside. Four were demolished and one moved to Scarborough. Construction of the section from Eglinton Avenue to Lawrence Avenue began on July 1, 1961, and it was opened to traffic in the evening of October 30, 1963, without any ceremony. The segment connected to Woodbine Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue, cutting off access to Woodbine from Lawrence Avenue. Northbound parkway traffic could continue north on Woodbine Avenue, then a two-lane road, from the parkway up to Highway 401. The section cost $2.723 million to complete. The third section to open was from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section involved the removal of CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A pedestrian overpass bridge was constructed to connect the east and west sections of Riverdale Park. The section opened in conjunction with the section of the expressway from the parkway to York Street on November 6, 1964. It was opened ceremonially by Ontario Premier John Robarts. The final section, from Lawrence Avenue to Sheppard Avenue was opened chaotically to traffic in the afternoon on November 17, 1966, but forced drivers to exit onto Highway 401; construction inspectors were not aware that the parkway was scheduled to open until they arrived on site that morning. The section north of Highway 401 remained unopened until March 1, 1967, due to ongoing construction of the Sheppard Avenue bridge. The final cost of the project was $40 million ($ in dollars). Since completion. In 1965, Metro Toronto Chief Coroner Morton Shulman released a report criticizing the lack of safety in the design of the parkway. In the first five months of 1965, there were 136 accidents on the parkway, with four deaths and 86 injuries. Among the ""death-dealing"" deficiencies that had to be corrected were inadequate guardrails, exposed steep slopes and light standards that were exposed to collision from passing high-speed traffic. Call boxes with emergency telephones were installed on the parkway in 1966. The boxes, attached to street lighting on the right shoulder, provided a direct line for help from the Ontario Motor League, now part of the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA). Today, the RESCU Traffic Management System monitors the highway and can call for emergency help. On April 18, 1969, the slope behind Davies Crescent (just west of Don Mills Road) gave way after heavy rain, covering the northbound lanes and part of the southbound lanes with up to of mud. There were only minor injuries. The slope, which had had its trees removed for the building of the expressway, was covered with sod and stakes to hold the soil. In the late 1980s, a new partial-access interchange was built at Wynford Drive to provide access between the parkway and the Concorde Place development. The new partial-access interchange was paid for by the developers. The ramp connecting Wynford with the northbound parkway required a tunnel under the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Midtown railway lines. To avoid delaying trains on the vital freight line, a prefabricated concrete arch was jacked into the embankment, at a time, over 12 days. This was the first North American use of such a technique. From 1986 to 1988, the City studied traffic congestion in the 'Don Valley Corridor', an area from Leslie Street east to Victoria Park Avenue. To improve traffic in the area, the proposed solutions were extending Leslie Street south of Eglinton Avenue and south-west to Bayview Avenue; widening Don Mills Road; and expanding the parkway. Two proposals were put forward for approval: the Leslie Street extension and widening of Don Mills Road. Don Mills Road was widened from four to six lanes with the new lanes to be high occupancy/bus lanes. The Leslie Street extension was approved by East York and North York, but was abandoned by Metro Council in 1993, after the provincial government refused to subsidize its construction. In 1989, a public meeting was held on the future of the Don River, which was widely known for its pollution, and the Don Valley, considered an ""industrial wasteland"" and which had seen its last industrial use (the Taylor, later Domtar, Paper Mill) close in 1982. The Toronto City Council formed the ""Task Force to Bring Back the Don"", an organization of volunteers to work on conservation efforts in the Don Valley. Since that time, the task force has planted some 40,000 trees in the valley, planted thousands of wildflowers and overseen the creation of wetlands along the river. Efforts continue to ameliorate the water quality of the river and improve the environment of the surrounding valley lands. These efforts can be seen in the ""Crother's Woods"" north of Bloor Street and the Chester Marsh just south of Bloor Street, alongside the parkway. In 1994, the overpass bridge over Pottery Road, north of the Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to the cumulative effect of heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year. In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland proposed to add two toll lanes in each direction along the parkway, from Highway 401 to Eglinton Avenue. From Eglinton Avenue south, one lane in each direction would be added. The proposal was criticized by transportation experts such as Transport 2000 for encouraging driving to downtown. Sutherland estimated the cost of the proposal at $200 million. On May 11, 2007, GO Transit announced a plan to put dedicated bus lanes on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses as an alternative to automobiles. The $12 million plan would be paid for by GO. The plan would require testing of soil conditions and an environmental assessment. GO Transit was taken over by the provincial Metrolinx transit agency, and the plan did not appear in the 2008 ""Big Move"" Regional Transportation Plan of Metrolinx. A second proposal to allow GO Transit buses to use the left shoulder to pass slow traffic was approved in June 2010 by Toronto City Council. The centre median shoulders, starting with the section between Lawrence Avenue and a point north of York Mills Road, are opened to GO Transit buses to pass other traffic, at no more than faster, when the other traffic is going at or less. These lanes opened to buses beginning September 7, 2010. City Council directed the General Manager of Transportation Services to report on the feasibility of future bus bypass lanes in the segments from Pottery Road to Don Mills Road and between Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue East. On June 7, 2010, a section of the expressway was dedicated by former Toronto mayor David Miller as part of the ""Route of Heroes"". Similar to the ""Highway of Heroes"" designation of part of Highway 401, the designation serves to honour fallen Canadian soldiers. The designation applies to the portion of the parkway between Highway 401 and Bloor Street by which repatriation processions travel when transporting the remains of Canadian soldiers from CFB Trenton to the Office of the Coroner in downtown Toronto. The lower section of the roadway from the Gardiner Expressway to south of Gerrard Street East has been flooded by overflowing water from the Don River on more than one occasion. This section of the Parkway was closed in 1986 and twice in 2013 due to flooding. Future. During the 2010 municipal election, mayoral candidate Sarah Thomson proposed a road toll for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway, drawing comments from critics and supporters across the city. Two projects are underway that may change the parkway's southern end. Waterfront Toronto is conducting an environmental assessment to evaluate replacing, modifying or removing the Gardiner Expressway east of Jarvis Street. The parkway would then end at Lake Shore Boulevard. A second proposal, known as the ""Don Mouth Naturalization and Port Lands Flood Protection"" project, seeks to recreate the natural mouth of the Don River into Toronto Harbour with the surrounding parkland. The project is managed by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and Waterfront Toronto. The ramps between the parkway and the Gardiner Expressway pass directly over the Don River channel. "
wikipedia-365734," Prince Edward Viaduct  The Prince Edward Viaduct System, commonly referred to as the Bloor Viaduct or the viaduct, is the name of a truss arch bridge system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that connects Bloor Street East, on the west side of the system, with Danforth Avenue on the east. The Don Valley phase of the system, the most recognizable, spans the Don River Valley, crossing over (from west to east) the Bayview Avenue Extension, the Don River, and the Don Valley Parkway. The Prince Edward Viaduct system also includes the Rosedale Valley phase (a smaller bridge carrying Bloor Street over the Rosedale Ravine and referred to as the Rosedale Valley Bridge) and the Sherbourne Phase, an embankment built to extend Bloor Street East to the Rosedale Ravine from Sherbourne Street. The Bloor Street-Rosedale Valley Bridge is a western extension of the Prince Edward Viaduct. The bridge, officially known as the Rosedale Valley Phase of the Prince Edward Viaduct System, runs west of the Bloor Street Viaduct and ends west of Parliament Street. The bridge stone work is similar to the Bloor Street Viaduct and another bridge on O'Connor Drive (over Taylor Creek) to the east of the Don River. The roadway has five lanes (three eastbound and two westbound) with a bike lane in each direction. The subway level connects Broadview Station in the east with Castle Frank and Sherbourne Stations to the west. Design. Designed by Edmund W. Burke, the Prince Edward Viaduct is a three hinged concrete-steel arch bridge, with a total span of 494 metres at 40 metres above the Don Valley. The bridge consists of a deck, made up of transverse beams and I-girders, which transfer load to column supports. The column supports then transfer the load to the trusses within the arches, which transfer the load to the arches themselves. Finally, the arches transfer their load through large hinges, which transfer load to a concrete pillar, and eventually to the ground. In addition to the Don River, the Don Valley Parkway, Bayview Avenue, two railway lines, an electrical transmission line, and a bicycle trail all pass under the bridge spans. History. Construction. Referendums on the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct were held in Toronto in every year from 1910 to 1913, with residents voting against its construction in 1912 by 59 votes and in favour in 1913 by 9236 votes. The projected cost of its construction increased from CDN$759,000 in 1910 to CDN$2.5 million in 1913; its final cost was CDN$2,480,349.05 ($ in dollars). Upon its completion in 1918, it was named for the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII. It was designed to facilitate mass transit; its upper deck accommodated trams, while both the Don Valley phase and the Rosedale Valley phase included a lower deck for rail transport, controversial at the time because of its high additional cost. The bridge's designer and the commissioner of public works R.C. Harris were able to have their way, and the lower deck eventually proved to save millions of dollars when the Toronto Transit Commission's Bloor–Danforth subway, opened in 1966, was able to use the Don Valley phase with no major structural changes to cross the Don River Valley. The Rosedale Valley phase was not used for the subway, as the curve between each phase - as well as the curve to the west at Parliament Street - was considered too sharp for the subway. A separate bridge was built over Rosedale Valley west of the Castle Frank Subway Station at the west end of the Bloor–Danforth Viaduct. This covered subway bridge was designed by John B. Parkin and Associates with De Leuw Cather Canada (now Delcan) and completed in 1966. Growth of Toronto. The Prince Edward Viaduct has had two major impacts on the development of Toronto as a city. First, the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct resulted in more rapid development of those portions of Toronto lying on the east side of the Don Valley. Secondly, the construction of the Bloor–Danforth line of the Toronto Transit Commission's subway system in the 1960s was significantly facilitated by the viaduct architect's decision to have a lower deck on the bridge. Suicides and accidental falls. At the time of the construction of the viaduct, suicide was not considered to be a major social issue, and as such the bridge design did not include any means for the prevention of suicides. As suicide became more prevalent in society, and with an increase in the city population, the Prince Edward Viaduct became a magnet for suicide, as people could easily jump over its low railings. This not only posed a risk to the lives of the jumpers, but also to the traffic underneath, which was in danger of being hit by a falling body. It was also possible for a child to climb onto the railing and fall accidentally while walking along it. With nearly 500 suicides by 2003, the Viaduct ranked as the second most fatal standing structure in the world, after the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. At its peak in 1997, the suicide rate averaged one person every 22 days. This prompted the construction of a suicide barrier in 2003 called the Luminous Veil. A 2010 study found that though the barrier prevented suicide attempts from the Viaduct, overall rates of suicide by jumping for the city of Toronto have not changed since its construction. Designed by architect Derek Revington and engineers at Halcrow Yolles, and completed in 2003 at the cost of C$5.5 million, the Luminous Veil consists of over 9,000 steel rods, 12.7 cm apart and 5 m high, stretched to cantilevered girders to function as a suicide barrier. At the same time as the construction of the Luminous Veil, the bridge also underwent a renovation with the waterproofing and concrete deterioration being replaced. While awaiting approval of the barrier and during construction, which was subject to numerous delays, 48 to 60 suicides took place at the bridge. The Luminous Veil received the 1999 Canadian Architect Award of Excellence. "
wikipedia-365737," Nerve fiber  A nerve fiber is a threadlike extension of a nerve cell and consists of an axon and myelin sheath (if present) in the nervous system. There are nerve fibers in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. A nerve fiber may be myelinated and/or unmyelinated. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced by oligodendroglia cells. Schwann cells form myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells can also make a thin covering for an axon which does not consist of myelin (in the PNS). A peripheral nerve fiber consists of an axon, myelin sheath, Schwann cells and its endoneurium. There are no endoneurium and Schwann cells in the central nervous system. Central nerve fibers. In the central nervous system, nerve fibers differ in terms of size, conduction velocity, and presence or lack of myelin. For example, the olfactory nerve fibers are short and without myelin, but the optic nerve fibers are myelinated (the olfactory and optic nerves are considered as a parts of the CNS, while other cranial nerves are a component of the PNS). A bundle of nerve fibers constitutes a tract in the central nervous system. The pyramidal tract and extrapyramidal tracts have long nerve fibers that descend from the brain to the spinal cord. These fibers have an important role in motor control, and are known as descending tracts. There are other bundles of nerve fibers in the CNS that are called ascending tracts.These carry sensory information from the periphery to the different areas of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem). Peripheral nerve fiber types. A nerve may be sensory, motor or sensory-motor (mixed). There are three types of nerve fibers in a mixed nerve that include: Components of peripheral nerve fiber. Each peripheral nerve fiber contains:  Classification of peripheral nerve fibers. There are three types of peripheral nerve fibers based on their diameter: A group. Fibers of the A group have a large diameter and high conduction velocity, and are myelinated fibers. The A group consists of four types of nerve fibers:  B group. Nerve fibers in this group are myelinated with a small diameter. Generally, they are the preganglionic fibers of the autonomic nervous system and have a low conduction velocity. C group. The C group fibers are unmyelinated and as the B group fibers have a small diameter and low conduction velocity. These fibers include: Motor fibers of the A group. A alpha fibers A beta fibers A gamma fibers Sensory fibers of the A group. A alpha fibers (Ia fiber or Ib fibers) A beta fibers (II fibers) A delta fibers (III fibers) Regeneration of peripheral nerve fibers. Nerves can be easily damaged in a traumatic event due to their sometimes vulnerable positions in the body. However, if a nerve is damaged, it does have the ability to regenerate if its soma and a small portion of the neurilemma remain. The nerve begins the process by destroying the nerve distal to the site of injury allowing Schwann cells, basal lamina, and the neurilemma near the injury to begin producing a regeneration tube. Nerve growth factors are produced causing many nerve sprouts to bud. When one of the growth processes finds the regeneration tube, it begins to grow rapidly towards its original destination guided the entire time by the regeneration tube. Nerve regeneration is very slow and can take up to several months to complete. While this process does repair some nerves, there will still be some functional deficit as the repairs are not perfect. "
wikipedia-365755," DI unit  A DI unit, DI box, direct box, or simply DI (variously claimed to stand for ""direct input"", ""direct injection"" or ""direct interface""), is a device typically used in recording studios to connect a high-impedance, line level, unbalanced output signal to a low-impedance microphone level balanced input, usually via XLR connector. DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar or electric bass to a mixing console's microphone input. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance matching/impedance bridging to minimize noise, distortion, and ground loops. DI boxes are extensively used with professional and semi-professional PA systems and in sound recording studios. Purpose. The Direct Input box takes a high impedance, unbalanced signal and converts it to a low impedance, balanced signal.  This allows the signal to be sent over long cable runs with significantly less signal loss (especially in high frequencies) due to the lowering of the impedance, and greater rejection of interference due to the benefit of common mode rejection in a balanced signal. Furthermore, the lower impedance (around 600 ohms is normal) allows an insignificant load to the input of a mixing console or preamp which is also designed to accept input from low impedance microphones. Passive DI units. A passive DI unit typically consists of an audio transformer used as a balun. The turns ratio is typically chosen to convert a nominal 50 kΩ signal source (such as the magnetic pickup of an electric guitar) to the 100–200 Ω expected by the input of an audio mixer. Typical turns ratios are in the range of 10:1 to 20:1. Less commonly, a passive DI unit may consist of a resistive load, with or without capacitor coupling. Such units are best suited to outputs designed for headphones or loudspeakers. The cheaper passive DI units are more susceptible to hum, and passive units tend to be less versatile than active. However, they require no batteries, are simpler to use, and the better units are extremely reliable when used as designed. Some models have no settings, while others can have a ground lift switch (to avoid ground loop problems), a pad switch (to accommodate different source levels) and a filter switch for coloring the sound. Active DI units. An active DI unit contains a preamplifier. Active DI units can therefore provide gain, and are inherently more complex and versatile than passive units. Active DI units require a power source, which is normally provided by batteries or a standard AC outlet connection, and may contain the option for phantom power use. Most active DI units provide switches to enhance their versatility. These may include gain or level adjustment, ground lift, power source selection, and mono or stereo mode. Ground lift switches often disconnect phantom power. A pass-through connector is a second jack, sometimes simply paralleled to the input connector, that delivers the input signal unchanged, to allow the DI unit to be inserted into a signal path without interrupting it. Pass-through is also commonly referred to as a bypass. True-bypass occurs when the signal goes straight from the input jack to the output jack with no circuitry involved and no loading of the source impedance. False bypass (or simply 'bypass') occurs when the signal is routed through the device circuitry with buffering and no other intentional change to the signal. However, due to the nature of electrical designs there is almost always some slight change in the signal. The extent of change and how noticeable it may be can vary from unit to unit. Typical applications. Direct boxes are typically used in instances of instruments or other devices that only contain an unbalanced 1/4"" phone output which needs to be connected to an XLR input. Multiple direct box circuits can be mounted inside one housing. These are used for multiple unbalanced outputs, such as for a bank of electronic keyboards. Acoustic or electric instruments. DI's can be used on instruments with electronic circuitry and pick ups that do not contain an XLR balanced output. An example of this application would be an electric keyboard that needs to be connected to a mixer board, either directly or through an audio snake. Another example would be an acoustic guitar with pickups, an electric guitar or bass guitar that would be mixed through a mixing console into a main or monitor mix. Instrument amplifiers. Some instrument amplifiers contain built-in DI units, and can be connected to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a person who wanted to run their instrument through a Public Address (PA) system while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier EQ though a pre eq/post eq switch. This can be used if a ""clean"" direct output from amplifier is desired. It is common to use both a DI and a microphone on the same source. One method is to connect a guitar amplifier speaker level output to a DI and then run it to one channel of the mixing console, and run a miked guitar speaker signal into another channel of the mixing console. Another method is to connect a DI between the guitar and the amplifier. The DI signal and miked guitar speaker can then be selectively blended, with the DI providing a more immediate, present, bright, un-equalized sound, and the microphone providing a more 'live' sound, with instrument amplifier characteristics and some room ambience. Examples of use. Direct-injection tracking is used on almost every electric bass part on ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", most prominently on ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", ""Lovely Rita"", and ""A Day in The Life"", as well as ""Only A Northern Song"", ""I Me Mine"", and the lead-guitar introducing ""Revolution"". Other clear examples include Dave Matthews Band's ""So Much To Say"" and Adele's ""Daydreamer"". "
wikipedia-365765," Machining  Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The many processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing.  The precise meaning of the term ""machining"" has evolved over the past two centuries as technology has advanced. During the Machine Age, it referred to (what we today might call) the ""traditional"" machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping. In these ""traditional"" or ""conventional"" machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry. Since the advent of new technologies such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym ""conventional machining"" can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage, the term ""machining"" without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.  Machining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites. A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Machining can be a business, a hobby, or both. Much of modern day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.  Machining operations. The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing. An unfinished workpiece requiring machining will need to have some material cut away to create a finished product. A finished product would be a workpiece that meets the specifications set out for that workpiece by engineering drawings or blueprints. For example, a workpiece may be required to have a specific outside diameter. A lathe is a machine tool that can be used to create that diameter by rotating a metal workpiece, so that a cutting tool can cut metal away, creating a smooth, round surface matching the required diameter and surface finish. A drill can be used to remove metal in the shape of a cylindrical hole. Other tools that may be used for various types of metal removal are milling machines, saws, and grinding machines. Many of these same techniques are used in woodworking. More recent, advanced machining techniques include electrical discharge machining (EDM), electro-chemical erosion, laser cutting, or water jet cutting to shape metal workpieces. As a commercial venture, machining is generally performed in a machine shop, which consists of one or more workrooms containing major machine tools. Although a machine shop can be a stand-alone operation, many businesses maintain internal machine shops which support specialized needs of the business. Machining requires attention to many details for a workpiece to meet the specifications set out in the engineering drawings or blueprints. Beside the obvious problems related to correct dimensions, there is the problem of achieving the correct finish or surface smoothness on the workpiece. The inferior finish found on the machined surface of a workpiece may be caused by incorrect clamping, a dull tool, or inappropriate presentation of a tool. Frequently, this poor surface finish, known as chatter, is evident by an undulating or irregular finish, and the appearance of waves on the machined surfaces of the workpiece. Overview of machining technology. Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the ""work""). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called ""cutting speed"" and a secondary motion called ""feed"". The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface. Types of machining operation. There are many kinds of machining operations, each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture. In turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape. The speed motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole. In boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture. In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is moved slowly relative to the material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool's axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are: Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing. Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining. The cutting tool. A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool: The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle ""α"". It is measured relative to the plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive or negative. The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly formed work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the finish. This angle between the work surface and the flank surface is called the relief angle. There are two basic types of cutting tools: A single point tool has one cutting edge and is used for turning, boreing and planing. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the original work surface of the workpart. The point is sometimes rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius. Multiple-cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the workpart by rotating. Drilling and milling uses rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Although the shapes of these tools are different from a single-point tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar. Cutting conditions. Relative motion is required between the tool and work to perform a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain cutting speed. In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This is a much slower motion, called the feed. The remaining dimension of the cut is the penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, called the depth of cut. Collectively, speed, feed, and depth of cut are called the cutting conditions. They form the three dimensions of the machining process, and for certain operations, their product can be used to obtain the material removal rate for the process: where Stages in metal cutting. Machining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by purpose and cutting conditions: Roughing cuts are used to remove large amount of material from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, i.e. with a large Material Removal Rate (MRR), in order to produce a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation. Finishing cuts are used to complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing cuts. Roughing operations are done at high feeds and depths – feeds of 0.4-1.25 mm/rev (0.015-0.050 in/rev) and depths of 2.5-20 mm (0.100-0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds and depths - feeds of 0.0125-0.04 mm/rev (0.0005-0.0015 in/rev) and depths of 0.75-2.0 mm (0.030-0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing. A cutting fluid is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate the cutting tool. Determining whether a cutting fluid should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper cutting fluid, is usually included within the scope of cutting condition. Today other forms of metal cutting are becoming increasingly popular. An example of this is water jet cutting. Water jet cutting involves pressurized water in excess of 620 MPa (90 000 psi) and is able to cut metal and have a finished product. This process is called cold cutting, and it increases efficiency as opposed to laser and plasma cutting. Relationship of subtractive and additive techniques. With the recent proliferation of additive manufacturing technologies, conventional machining has been retronymously classified, in thought and language, as a subtractive manufacturing method. In narrow contexts, additive and subtractive methods may compete with each other. In the broad context of entire industries, their relationship is complementary. Each method has its own advantages over the other. While additive manufacturing methods can produce very intricate prototype designs impossible to replicate by machining, strength and material selection may be limited. "
wikipedia-375377," Bob Riley  Robert Renfroe ""Bob"" Riley (born October 3, 1944) is an American politician in the Republican Party. He was the 52nd Governor of Alabama, first elected in 2002, and re-elected in 2006. Early life, education and early career. Riley was born in Ashland, Alabama, a small town in Clay County where his family ranched and farmed for six generations. Riley attended the University of Alabama,where he was a brother of Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity and graduated with a degree in business administration. U.S. House of Representatives. Riley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996, defeating his Democratic opponent, State Senator T.D. ""Ted"" Little (Auburn, Ala.) and Libertarian John Sophocleus. Riley served as a representative of Alabama's 3rd congressional district from 1997 to 2003. Governor of Alabama. 2002 election. Riley did not run for re-election to the House in November 2002 (as a supporter of term limits, he imposed a three-term limit on himself), instead running for Governor of Alabama and defeating the Democratic incumbent by approximately 3,000 votes - the narrowest margin in the state's history for a gubernatorial race. The result was controversial, as the initial election night count showed a 2,000-plus vote victory for Riley's opponent, Don Siegelman. First term. On May 10, 2005, Riley's approval ratings were 36% approving and 52% disapproving of his job as governor. By September 20, 2005, Riley’s approval ratings had increased substantially to 58 percent approving and 38% disapproving. Analysis of this increase seems to indicate that it may be attributed to the public’s perception of Riley’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By February 14, 2006, Riley's approval ratings had slightly decreased, with 52% approving and 43% disapproving of his job as governor. As of August, 2006, his approval rating is at 62% with a disapproval rating of 35%. In 2003, Alabama state politics gained national attention when the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the court building. Riley reportedly supported Moore, but ultimately did not play a large role in the dispute. Riley stated there was nothing he could do to prevent Moore from being removed from office by a judicial ethics panel. Moore challenged Riley in the June 6, 2006 GOP primary. Property tax appraisals became a major campaign issue with Riley's opponents claiming that Riley, acting through his revenue commissioner, ordered that property tax appraisals be made annually, rather than the quadrennial reappraisals that were established practice. Because property values tend to increase over time, making appraisals more frequent has the indirect effect of increasing the taxes paid by property owners. Riley's opponents claimed that by doing so, he raised taxes without a vote of either the Legislature or the people. Riley claims he is merely following the language of the law, and the advice of his attorneys. In the first year of his administration, Riley proposed ""Amendment One"", which would have made swift changes to the state's tax system. The plan essentially consisted of income tax breaks for lower brackets, offset by various tax hikes on consumption, property and income from higher brackets. Part of the problem that this plan sought to address was the strong dependence the Alabama tax system placed upon sales tax, which makes the state budget dependent upon the economy in the state. The plan was estimated to yield an overall state revenue increase of $1.2 billion per year. The plan also included accountability reforms, including changes to teacher tenure policies, accountability for school systems, and bans on pass-through pork. This plan also included provisions for a scholarship program for Alabama students to attend college and funding of other education initiatives.  Support as well as opposition for this plan came from traditionally opposing forces in Alabama, crossing party lines. This included support from pro-business organizations, including the Business Council of Alabama and many Chambers of Commerce, as well as prominent education organizations, including the Alabama Education Association. Other progressively-minded non-profit groups supported this plan, including many organizations that had sought changes in the Alabama tax system for many years. These organizations saw this as an opportunity for Alabama to invest in the future of the state through investments in education and governmental reforms. Riley also presented this plan using Christian terms, building upon language already present in the state to argue that the Alabama tax system placed the heaviest burden upon the poorest citizens of the state. Opponents to the plan included the Alabama chapter of the Christian Coalition (splitting with the national Christian Coalition who endorsed the plan), and the Alabama Farmers Federation (ALFA). A number of the people who opposed this plan, included both organizations mentioned, had strongly supported Riley for Governor in 2002. These opponents based a campaign upon a criticism of the state legislature and used the complexity of the plans to claim that taxes would go up on people in the state. While proponents had pointed to studies of the plan showing the majority of Alabamians seeing a lower overall tax burden, polls indicated that most citizens - likely influenced by the proposed property tax increase - believed their personal taxes would be higher under the plan. Amendment One was rejected by voters on September 9, 2003, with 68 percent opposed. While Riley's Amendment One was soundly rejected by Alabama voters, it did gain him national recognition. For his leadership in addressing the state’s fiscal crisis, Governor Riley was named the “Public Official of the Year” by Governing magazine in 2003, and Time magazine hailed him for being one of the nation’s “most courageous politicians.” The overwhelming rejection of this plan forced Riley to mend fences within his own base and seek to do some reforms without the broad tax increases that Amendment One sought. Some parts of the proposal have been enacted, such as efforts to raise the minimum tax threshold in Alabama. Riley has claimed credit for helping to spur economic development in Alabama. Riley points to the opening of an aeronautics engineering facility in Mobile by EADS, the parent company of Airbus, which may ripen into an aircraft assembly plant if EADS secures future contracts. Riley's critics have pointed out that Riley has failed to emulate the success of predecessors, such as Siegelmanduring whose administration the Hyundai plant was successfully recruitedand Jim Folsom, Jr., in securing automotive manufacturing plants. Specifically, when Kia announced in March 2006 it would build a maunfucturing plant in Georgia, Riley was criticized by Siegelman, for Alabama's failure to mount a serious bid for the plant. Under Riley's administration, unemployment in Alabama fell from 5.3% in January, 2003 when Riley took office to 3.3% in March, 2006. This rate was the lowest ever recorded since statistics began being tracked in 1976 and was among the nations lowest.  In 2005, Governor Riley was criticized by some Mobile County residents after issuing that area of the state a ""mandatory"" evacuation order in advance of Hurricane Dennis' landfall. Residents felt the issue was better addressed during Hurricane Katrina using a layered approach with sections of the county evacuated instead of the entire county. On August 28, 2005, Governor Riley declared a state of emergency for the approaching Hurricane Katrina. On the same day, he requested president George W. Bush to declare ""expedited major disaster declaration"" for six counties of south Alabama, which was approved by the evening of August 29. 350 national guardsmen were called on duty as of August 30. On November 9, 2005 Riley called for a citizens' boycott of Aruba, alleging that the local government was engaged in a cover-up of the disappearance of Alabama native Natalee Holloway. In November 2005, Riley was linked to the Jack Abramoff scandal when his former Congressional press secretary, Michael Scanlon, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the matter. It further emerged that, as a Congressman, Riley signed a letter on behalf of the U.S. Family Network, opposing expansion of casino gambling in Alabama. The U.S. Family Network was revealed to be an Abramoff front, funded by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, which operated competing casinos. Riley has denied knowing the source of this funding. 2006 election. Riley defeated Democrat Lieutenant Governor Lucy Baxley easily as his approval ratings made a comeback. Second term. In April 2007 the unemployment rate once again reached 3.3 percent. However, recent labor statistics provided by the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations indicate that under Governor Riley, Alabama's unemployment nearly tripled to a seasonally adjusted rate of 8.4% in February 2009. The rates for seasonally adjusted and unadjusted range from 7.8 to 8.9 percent for January and February 2009.  Under Governor Riley, Alabama's unemployment has continued to climb, and Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Director Tom Surtees issued a press release dated 19 June 2009, which indicated that Alabama’s unemployment rate for May rose to 9.8%, an increase from April’s rate of 9.0%, and is Alabama's highest unemployment rate in 25 years.  Critics have claimed that recent developments are a consequence of national economic recovery and pointed to the loss of thousands of Alabama's historic textile jobs under Riley. Nevertheless, the state under Riley's administration was recognized as ""State of the Year"" by ""Southern Business and Development"" magazine four years in a row and received other awards for competitiveness, job creation and economic development. Among other honors, ""Worldwide Interactive Network"" named the Alabama Office of Workforce Development the No. 1 U.S. employee development agency and ""Expansion Management"" magazine has ranked Alabama Industrial Development Training No. 1 among workforce training programs. Riley's Alabama Bureau of Tourism & Travel received the National Council of State Tourism Directors' annual Mercury Award recognizing its ""Year of Alabama Food"" as the nation's top tourism campaign. In May 2007, Riley announced that ThyssenKrupp would build a $4.2 billion state-of-the-art steel mill north of Mobile, Alabama, the largest economic announcement in Alabama's history, and largest corporate project in U.S. history. The mill, now in operation, employs 2,700 workers  As part of his plan to provide open government, Riley has posted on the Governor's website the monthly expenditures from the Governor's Contingency Fund and the quarterly flight logs from all state airplanes. As Governor, Riley oversaw 15 executions in Alabama, more than any of his predecessors since 1983 (see Capital punishment in Alabama). 2012 presidential speculation. An editorial by the ""Washington Times"" and separate piece in the paper on August 13, 2009, in what was deemed to be an open endorsement of Bob Riley as a potential 2012 presidential candidate instantly threw the governor's name into the political field of possible nominees as state and national media jumped on the story. Governor Riley during an interview the same day denied he was considering a future presidential run. On February 2, 2011 both the ""Birmingham News"" and the ""Decatur Daily"" also ran stories speculating that Riley was considering running for President. In the end, Riley did not run. Personal life. Riley is married to the former Patsy Adams, also from Clay County. The Rileys have four children, Rob, Jenice, Minda and Krisalyn. Jenice, the Rileys' first daughter and the campaign's fundraiser, died in August 2001. The Rileys have three granddaughters and three grandsons. He is an alumni brother of Phi Kappa Sigma. On June 26, 2011, Riley was on a cross-country trip on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle when he crashed on the Dalton Highway in Alaska and sustained serious injuries. "
wikipedia-375380," Mereology  In philosophy and mathematical logic, mereology (from the Greek μέρος, root: μερε(σ)-, ""part"" and the suffix -logy ""study, discussion, science"") treats parts and the wholes they form. Whereas set theory is founded on the membership relation between a set and its elements, mereology emphasizes the meronomic relation between entities, which from a set theoretic perspective is closer to that of inclusion between sets. Mereology has been axiomatized in various ways as applications of predicate logic to formal ontology, of which mereology is an important part. A common element of such axiomatizations is the assumption, shared with inclusion, that the part-whole relation orders its universe, meaning that everything is a part of itself (reflexivity), that a part of a part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two distinct entities cannot each be a part of the other (antisymmetry). A variant of this axiomatization denies that anything is ever part of itself (irreflexive) while accepting transitivity, from which antisymmetry follows automatically. Standard university texts on logic and mathematics are silent about mereology, which has undoubtedly contributed to its obscurity. Although mereology is an application of mathematical logic, what can be argued a sort of ""proto-geometry"", it has been wholly developed by logicians, ontologists, linguists, engineers, and computer scientists, especially those working in artificial intelligence.  ""Mereology"" can also refer to formal work in General Systems Theory on system decomposition and parts, wholes and boundaries (by, e.g., Mihajlo D. Mesarovic (1970), Gabriel Kron (1963), or Maurice Jessel (see (Bowden 1989, 1998)). A hierarchical version of Gabriel Kron's Network Tearing was published by Keith Bowden (1991), reflecting David Lewis's ideas on Gunk. Such ideas appear in theoretical computer science and physics, often in combination with Sheaf, Topos, or Category Theory. See also the work of Steve Vickers on (parts of) specifications in Computer Science, Joseph Goguen on physical systems, and Tom Etter (1996, 1998) on Link Theory and Quantum Mechanics. The class concept in object-oriented programming lends a mereological aspect to programming not found in either imperative programs or declarative programs. Method inheritance enriches this application of mereology by providing for passing procedural information down the part-whole relation, thereby making method inheritance a naturally arising aspect of mereology. History. Informal part-whole reasoning was consciously invoked in metaphysics and ontology from Plato (in particular, in the second half of the ""Parmenides"") and Aristotle onwards, and more or less unwittingly in 19th-century mathematics until the triumph of set theory around 1910. Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2001) sheds much light on part-whole reasoning during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and reviews how Cantor and Peano devised set theory. It appears that the first to reason consciously and at length about parts and wholes was Edmund Husserl in his 1901 ""Logical Investigations"" (Husserl 1970 is the English translation). However, the word ""mereology"" is absent from his writings, and he employed no symbolism even though his doctorate was in mathematics. Stanisław Leśniewski coined ""mereology"" in 1927, from the Greek word μέρος (""méros"", ""part""), to refer to a formal theory of part-whole he devised in a series of highly technical papers published between 1916 and 1931, and translated in Leśniewski (1992). Leśniewski's student Alfred Tarski, in his Appendix E to Woodger (1937) and the paper translated as Tarski (1984), greatly simplified Leśniewski's formalism. Other students (and students of students) of Lesniewski elaborated this ""Polish mereology"" over the course of the 20th century. For a good selection of the literature on Polish mereology, see Srzednicki and Rickey (1984). For a survey of Polish mereology, see Simons (1987). Since 1980 or so, however, research on Polish mereology has been almost entirely historical in nature. A.N. Whitehead planned a fourth volume of ""Principia Mathematica"", on geometry, but never wrote it. His 1914 correspondence with Bertrand Russell reveals that his intended approach to geometry can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, as mereological in essence. This work culminated in Whitehead (1916) and the mereological systems of Whitehead (1919, 1920). In 1930, Henry Leonard completed a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation in philosophy, setting out a formal theory of the part-whole relation. This evolved into the ""calculus of individuals"" of Goodman and Leonard (1940). Goodman revised and elaborated this calculus in the three editions of Goodman (1951). The calculus of individuals is the starting point for the post-1970 revival of mereology among logicians, ontologists, and computer scientists, a revival well-surveyed in Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999). Axioms and primitive notions. It is possible to formulate a ""naive mereology"" analogous to naive set theory. Doing so gives rise to paradoxes analogous to Russell's paradox. Let there be an object O such that every object that is not a proper part of itself is a proper part of O. Is O a proper part of itself? No, because no object is a proper part of itself; and yes, because it meets the specified requirement for inclusion as a proper part of O. (Every object is, of course, an ""improper"" part of itself. Another, though differently structured, paradox can be made using ""improper part"" instead of ""proper part""; and another using ""improper or proper part"".) Hence, mereology requires an axiomatic formulation.  A mereological ""system"" is a first-order theory (with identity) whose universe of discourse consists of wholes and their respective parts, collectively called ""objects"". Mereology is a collection of nested and non-nested axiomatic systems, not unlike the case with modal logic. The treatment, terminology, and hierarchical organization below follow Casati and Varzi (1999: Ch. 3) closely. For a more recent treatment, correcting certain misconceptions, see Hovda (2008). Lower-case letters denote variables ranging over objects. Following each symbolic axiom or definition is the number of the corresponding formula in Casati and Varzi, written in bold. A mereological system requires at least one primitive binary relation (dyadic predicate). The most conventional choice for such a relation is Parthood (also called ""inclusion""), """"x"" is a ""part"" of ""y"""", written ""Pxy"". Nearly all systems require that Parthood partially order the universe. The following defined relations, required for the axioms below, follow immediately from Parthood alone: Overlap and Underlap are reflexive, symmetric, and intransitive. Systems vary in what relations they take as primitive and as defined. For example, in extensional mereologies (defined below), ""Parthood"" can be defined from Overlap as follows: The axioms are: Various systems. Simons (1987), Casati and Varzi (1999) and Hovda (2008) describe many mereological systems whose axioms are taken from the above list. We adopt the boldface nomenclature of Casati and Varzi. The best-known such system is the one called ""classical extensional mereology"", hereinafter abbreviated CEM (other abbreviations are explained below). In CEM, P.1 through P.8' hold as axioms or are theorems. M9, ""Top"", and ""Bottom"" are optional. The systems in the table below are partially ordered by inclusion, in the sense that, if all the theorems of system A are also theorems of system B, but the converse is not necessarily true, then B ""includes"" A. The resulting Hasse diagram is similar to that in Fig. 2, and Fig. 3.2 in Casati and Varzi (1999: 48). There are two equivalent ways of asserting that the universe is partially ordered: Assume either M1–M3, or that Proper ""Parthood"" is transitive and asymmetric, hence a strict partial order. Either axiomatization results in the system M. M2 rules out closed loops formed using ""Parthood"", so that the part relation is well-founded. Sets are well-founded if the axiom of Regularity is assumed. The literature contains occasional philosophical and common-sense objections to the transitivity of ""Parthood"". M4 and M5 are two ways of asserting ""supplementation"", the mereological analog of set complementation, with M5 being stronger because M4 is derivable from M5. M and M4 yield ""minimal"" mereology, MM. MM, reformulated in terms of Proper Part, is Simons's (1987) preferred minimal system.  In any system in which M5 or M5' are assumed or can be derived, then it can be proved that two objects having the same proper parts are identical. This property is known as ""Extensionality"", a term borrowed from set theory, for which extensionality is the defining axiom. Mereological systems in which Extensionality holds are termed ""extensional"", a fact denoted by including the letter E in their symbolic names. M6 asserts that any two underlapping objects have a unique sum; M7 asserts that any two overlapping objects have a unique product. If the universe is finite or if ""Top"" is assumed, then the universe is closed under ""sum"". Universal closure of ""Product"" and of supplementation relative to ""W"" requires ""Bottom"". ""W"" and ""N"" are, evidently, the mereological analog of the universal and empty sets, and ""Sum"" and ""Product"" are, likewise, the analogs of set-theoretical ""union"" and ""intersection"". If M6 and M7 are either assumed or derivable, the result is a mereology with ""closure"". Because ""Sum"" and ""Product"" are binary operations, M6 and M7 admit the sum and product of only a finite number of objects. The ""fusion"" axiom, M8, enables taking the sum of infinitely many objects. The same holds for ""Product"", when defined. At this point, mereology often invokes set theory, but any recourse to set theory is eliminable by replacing a formula with a quantified variable ranging over a universe of sets by a schematic formula with one free variable. The formula comes out true (is satisfied) whenever the name of an object that would be a member of the set (if it existed) replaces the free variable. Hence any axiom with sets can be replaced by an axiom schema with monadic atomic subformulae. M8 and M8' are schemas of just this sort. The syntax of a first-order theory can describe only a denumerable number of sets; hence, only denumerably many sets may be eliminated in this fashion, but this limitation is not binding for the sort of mathematics contemplated here. If M8 holds, then ""W"" exists for infinite universes. Hence, ""Top"" need be assumed only if the universe is infinite and M8 does not hold. It is interesting to note that ""Top"" (postulating ""W"") is not controversial, but ""Bottom"" (postulating ""N"") is. Leśniewski rejected ""Bottom"", and most mereological systems follow his example (an exception is the work of Richard Milton Martin). Hence, while the universe is closed under sum, the product of objects that do not overlap is typically undefined. A system with ""W"" but not ""N"" is isomorphic to: Postulating ""N"" renders all possible products definable, but also transforms classical extensional mereology into a set-free model of Boolean algebra. If sets are admitted, M8 asserts the existence of the fusion of all members of any nonempty set. Any mereological system in which M8 holds is called ""general"", and its name includes G. In any general mereology, M6 and M7 are provable. Adding M8 to an extensional mereology results in ""general extensional mereology"", abbreviated GEM; moreover, the extensionality renders the fusion unique. On the converse, however, if the fusion asserted by M8 is assumed unique, so that M8' replaces M8, then - as Tarski (1929) had shown - M3 and M8' suffice to axiomatize GEM, a remarkably economical result. Simons (1987: 38–41) lists a number of GEM theorems. M2 and a finite universe necessarily imply ""Atomicity"", namely that everything either is an atom or includes atoms among its proper parts. If the universe is infinite, ""Atomicity"" requires M9. Adding M9 to any mereological system, X results in the atomistic variant thereof, denoted AX. ""Atomicity"" permits economies, for instance, assuming that M5' implies ""Atomicity"" and extensionality, and yields an alternative axiomatization of AGEM. Set theory. Stanisław Leśniewski rejected set theory, a stance that has come to be known as nominalism. For a long time, nearly all philosophers and mathematicians avoided mereology, seeing it as tantamount to a rejection of set theory. Goodman too was a nominalist, and his fellow nominalist Richard Milton Martin employed a version of the calculus of individuals throughout his career, starting in 1941. Much early work on mereology was motivated by a suspicion that set theory was ontologically suspect, and that Occam's Razor requires that one minimise the number of posits in one's theory of the world and of mathematics. Mereology replaces talk of ""sets"" of objects with talk of ""sums"" of objects, objects being no more than the various things that make up wholes. Many logicians and philosophers reject these motivations, on such grounds as:  For a survey of attempts to found mathematics without using set theory, see Burgess and Rosen (1997). In the 1970s, thanks in part to Eberle (1970), it gradually came to be understood that one can employ mereology regardless of one's ontological stance regarding sets. This understanding is called the ""ontological innocence"" of mereology. This innocence stems from mereology being formalizable in either of two equivalent ways: Once it became clear that mereology is not tantamount to a denial of set theory, mereology became largely accepted as a useful tool for formal ontology and metaphysics. In set theory, singletons are ""atoms"" that have no (non-empty) proper parts; many consider set theory useless or incoherent (not ""well-founded"") if sets cannot be built up from unit sets. The calculus of individuals was thought to require that an object either have no proper parts, in which case it is an ""atom"", or be the mereological sum of atoms. Eberle (1970) showed how to construct a calculus of individuals lacking ""atoms"", i.e., one where every object has a ""proper part"" (defined below) so that the universe is infinite.  There are analogies between the axioms of mereology and those of standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), if ""Parthood"" is taken as analogous to subset in set theory. On the relation of mereology and ZF, also see Bunt (1985). One of the very few contemporary set theorist to discuss mereology is Potter (2004). Lewis (1991) went further, showing informally that mereology, augmented by a few ontological assumptions and plural quantification, and some novel reasoning about singletons, yields a system in which a given individual can be both a member and a subset of another individual. In the resulting system, the axioms of ZFC (and of Peano arithmetic) are theorems. Forrest (2002) revises Lewis's analysis by first formulating a generalization of CEM, called ""Heyting mereology"", whose sole nonlogical primitive is ""Proper Part"", assumed transitive and antireflexive. There exists a ""fictitious"" null individual that is a proper part of every individual. Two schemas assert that every lattice join exists (lattices are complete) and that meet distributes over join. On this Heyting mereology, Forrest erects a theory of ""pseudosets"", adequate for all purposes to which sets have been put. Mathematics. Husserl never claimed that mathematics could or should be grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology as an alternative to set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his ""Selected Logic Papers"". In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem. To date, the only persons well trained in mathematics to write on mereology have been Alfred Tarski and Rolf Eberle. Eberle (1970) clarified the relation between mereology and Boolean algebra, and mereology and set theory. He is one of the very few contributors to mereology to prove sound and complete each system he describes. Topological notions of boundaries and connection can be married to mereology, resulting in mereotopology; see Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5). Whitehead's 1929 ""Process and Reality"" contains a good deal of informal mereotopology. Mereology and natural language. Bunt (1985), a study of the semantics of natural language, shows how mereology can help understand such phenomena as the mass–count distinction and verb aspect. But Nicolas (2008) argues that a different logical framework, called plural logic, should be used for that purpose. Also, natural language often employs ""part of"" in ambiguous ways (Simons 1987 discusses this at length). Hence, it is unclear how, if at all, one can translate certain natural language expressions into mereological predicates. Steering clear of such difficulties may require limiting the interpretation of mereology to mathematics and natural science. Casati and Varzi (1999), for example, limit the scope of mereology to physical objects. Important surveys. The books by Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) differ in their strengths: Simons devotes considerable effort to elucidating historical notations. The notation of Casati and Varzi is often used. Both books include excellent bibliographies. To these works should be added Hovda (2008), which presents the latest state of the art on the axiomatization of mereology. "
wikipedia-375390," Donald A. Glaser  Donald Arthur Glaser (September 21, 1926 – February 28, 2013) was an American physicist, neurobiologist, and the winner of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the bubble chamber used in subatomic particle physics. Education. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Glaser completed his Bachelor of Science degree in physics and mathematics from Case School of Applied Science in 1946. He completed his Ph.D. in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1949. Glaser accepted a position as an instructor at the University of Michigan in 1949, and was promoted to professor in 1957. He joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, in 1959, as a Professor of Physics. During this time his research concerned short-lived elementary particles. The bubble chamber enabled him to observe the paths and lifetimes of the particles.  Starting in 1962, Glaser changed his field of research to molecular biology, starting with a project on ultraviolet-induced cancer. In 1964, he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology. Glaser's position (since 1989) was Professor of Physics and Neurobiology in the Graduate School. Personal life. Donald Glaser was born on September 21, 1926, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Lena and William J. Glaser, a businessman. He enjoyed music and played the piano, violin, and viola. He went to Cleveland Heights High School, where he became interested in physics as a means to understand the physical world. He died in his sleep at the age of 86 on February 28, 2013 in Berkeley, California. Education and early career. Glaser attended Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University), where he completed his Bachelor’s degree in physics and mathematics in 1946. During the course of his education there, he became especially interested in particle physics. He played viola in the Cleveland Philharmonic while at Case, and taught mathematics classes at the college after graduation. He continued on to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he pursued his Ph.D. in physics. His interest in particle physics led him to work with Nobel laureate Carl David Anderson, studying cosmic rays with cloud chambers. He preferred the accessibility of cosmic ray research over that of nuclear physics. While at Caltech he learned to design and build the equipment he needed for his experiments, and this skill would prove to be useful throughout his career. He also attended molecular genetics seminars led by Nobel laureate Max Delbrück; he would return to this field later.  Glaser completed his doctoral thesis, ""The Momentum Distribution of Charged Cosmic Ray Particles Near Sea Level"", after starting as an instructor at the University of Michigan in 1949. He received his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1950, and he was promoted to Professor at Michigan in 1957. Bubble chamber. While teaching at Michigan, Glaser began to work on experiments that led to the creation of the bubble chamber. His experience with cloud chambers at Caltech had shown him that they were inadequate for studying elementary particles. In a cloud chamber, particles pass though gas and collide with metal plates that obscure the scientists’ view of the event. The cloud chamber also needs time to reset between recording events and cannot keep up with accelerators' rate of particle production. He experimented with using superheated liquid in a glass chamber. Charged particles would leave a track of bubbles as they passed through the liquid, and their tracks could be photographed. He created the first bubble chamber with ether. He experimented with hydrogen while visiting the University of Chicago, showing that hydrogen would also work in the chamber. It has often been claimed that Glaser was inspired to his invention by the bubbles in a glass of beer; however, in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, saying that although beer was not the ""inspiration"" for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes. His new invention was ideal for use with high-energy accelerators, so Glaser traveled to Brookhaven National Laboratory with some students to study elementary particles using the accelerator there. The images that he created with his bubble chamber brought recognition of the importance of his device, and he was able to get funding to continue experimenting with larger chambers. Glaser was then recruited by Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez, who was working on a hydrogen bubble chamber at the University of California at Berkeley. Glaser accepted an offer to become a Professor of Physics there in 1959. Nobel Prize. Glaser was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize for Physics for the invention of the bubble chamber. His invention allowed scientists to observe what happens to high-energy beams from an accelerator, thus paving the way for many important discoveries. Transition to molecular biology. After winning the Nobel Prize, Glaser began to think about switching from physics into a new field. He wanted to concentrate on science, and found that as the experiments and equipment grew larger in scale and cost, he was doing more administrative work. He also anticipated that the ever-more-complex equipment would cause consolidation into fewer sites and would require more travel for physicists working in high-energy physics. Recalling his interest in molecular genetics that began at Caltech, Glaser began to study biology. He spent a summer at MIT as a visiting professor and attended biology seminars there. He also spent a semester in Copenhagen with Ole Maaloe, the prominent Danish molecular biologist. He worked in UC Berkeley’s Virus Lab (now the Biochemistry and Virus Laboratory), doing experiments with bacterial phages, bacteria, and mammalian cells. He studied the development of cancer cells, in particular the skin cancer ""xeroderma pigmentosum"". As with the bubble chamber, he used his experience designing equipment to improve the experimental process. He automated the process of pouring out agar, spreading culture, and counting colonies of cells using a machine he called the dumbwaiter. It took photographs, administered chemicals, and had a mechanical hand to pick up colonies. Commercial ventures. While continuing to work at UC Berkeley, Glaser started Berkeley Scientific Laboratory with Bill Wattenberg in 1968. The short-lived partnership worked on automating diagnostic procedures. In 1971 he founded Cetus Corporation with Moshe Alafi, Ron Cape, and Peter Farley. Glaser’s position was Chairman of the Science Advisory Board. The founders felt that the knowledge scientists had gained about DNA had not yet been applied to solve real problems. The company did microbial strain improvement, and then genetic engineering, becoming the first biotechnology company. Cetus was purchased by Chiron Corporation in 1991. Transition to neurobiology. As molecular biology became more dependent on biochemistry, Glaser again considered a career change. His experience automating visual tasks in physics and molecular biology led him to an interest in human vision and how the brain processes what is seen. He began to work on computational modeling of the visual system and visual psychophysics. "
wikipedia-375393," Wong Tai Sin Temple  Wong Tai Sin Temple () is a well known shrine and major tourist attraction in Hong Kong. It is dedicated to Wong Tai Sin, or the Great Immortal Wong. The 18,000-m² Taoist temple is famed for the many prayers answered: ""What you request is what you get"" (有求必應) via a practice called ""kau cim"". The temple is located on the southern side of Lion Rock in the north of Kowloon. History. In the early 20th century, Leung Renyan (梁仁菴) spread the influence of Wong Tai Sin from Xiqiao Mountain (西樵山) in Nanhai (南海縣), Guangdong Province (廣東省) of China to Wan Chai (灣仔) in Hong Kong. Leung arrived in Hong Kong in 1915. He rented an apartment in Wan Chai, and set up an altar in his apartment. Later he opened an herbal medicine shop nearby and moved the altar to the back of the shop. Customers coming to his shop could pray at Wong Tai Sin's altar and seek advice for their ailments. Leung would then fill their prescriptions. We can assume that healing did take place, as the popularity of Wong Tai Sin began to grow. However in 1918, Leung's shop was destroyed by fire. In 1921, Leung said that he received a message from Wong Tai Sin instructing him to construct a new shrine. Leung Renyan and his Taoist fellow were advised to start walking from Kowloon City Pier towards the north with 3,000 steps. When they arrived at Chuk Yuen Village (竹園村), they put a piece of bamboo into the ground as a mark. Then they consulted Wong Tai Sin via the process of "" Fu Ji "" (扶乩). They were told that it was a good site. Wong Tai Sin also taught them to determine the would-be centre of the Temple by 3 Chinese feet (approximately 1 metre) on the right and 3 Chinese feet (approximately 1 metre) backwards of the mark and the would-be temple was named as ""Chik Chung Sin Shrine"" (赤松仙館) (literally : the Red Pine Fairy Shrine). The Taoist priests were also asked to start the construction of the shrine on 24th of the sixth lunar month by one of the Taoist Gods, Wen Chang Di (文昌帝) via the process of ""Fu Ji"". Eventually the shrine was completed and was officiated on the 20th of the seventh lunar month. In the same year, on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month, during the celebration of the birthday of Wong Tai Sin, the altar was named as ""Pu Yi Tan"" (普宜壇)by the most superior Taoist God, Yu Di (玉帝) via the process of ""Fu Ji"". Later on, the other Taoist God, Wen Chang Di gave the name of the premises as ""Sik Sik Yuen"" (嗇色園) via the process of ""Fu Ji"". Meanwhile, the managing body, Sik Sik Yuen was established. In 1925, the shrine was renamed as ""Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall"" (赤松黃仙祠) (literally : the Red Pine Wong Fairy Hall) by Taoist Fairy, Lu Ju (呂祖) through the process of ""Fu Ji"". Since then, the name ""Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall"" has replaced the original name. According to the then regulations, Sik Sik Yuen (嗇色園) used to be a private shrine and only Taoists or their family members were allowed. It was not until 1934, Sik Sik Yuen formally applied to the government for opening the Temple to the public during the 1st lunar month of every Chinese New Year. However, in 1956 Sik Sik Yuen was allowed to open completely to the public. In 1956, the government proposed to reclaim the temple for public housing development. Chairman Wong Wan Tin's pushed for the temple to remain open. Charging a 10-cent admission fee at the main entrance, fees were donated to the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals. To facilitate administration and management, the temple was registered as a limited company of charitable nature in 1965, and was granted the immunity of not having to add the word ""Limited"" to the organization's name. Because of its historic significance, the Temple is graded as a Grade II historic building. Facilities. There is a Nine-Dragon Wall modeled after one in Beijing. The Three-Saint Hall (三聖堂) is dedicated to Lü Dongbin, Guan Yin, and Lord Guan. Containing a portrait of Confucius, the Taoist temple has a collection of Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist literature. The architecture is the traditional Chinese temple style with grand red pillars, a magnificent golden roof adorned with blue friezes, yellow latticework, and multi-colored carvings. Aside from the Daxiong-baodian or Grand Hall, Sansheng Hall and the Good Wish Garden are also worth seeing. The temple grounds also feature three memorial archways. The first one stands outside the temple and is carved with the name of the temple. If you walk past the soothsayers and the fortune-telling stalls, you can see another memorial archway. And if you continue further along the third memorial archway standing before you. . Traditions. Annually, from January 1 to 15, the temple receives numerous visitors, such as those whose prayers were answered returning to thank the immortal. Wong Tai Sin's birthday on the 23rd day of the 8th lunar month, and the Chinese New Year holidays are the busiest times for the temple. On the Chinese New Year's Eve, thousands of worshippers wait outside the temple before midnight and rush in to the main altar to offer Wong Tai Sin their glowing incense sticks when the year comes. As the tradition goes, the earlier they offer the incense, the better luck they will have that year. Most of the visitors come to the temple in search for a spiritual answer via a practice called ""kau cim"". They light incense sticks, kneel before the main altar, make a wish, and shake a bamboo cylinder containing fortune sticks until a stick falls out. This stick is exchanged for a piece of paper bearing the same number, and then the soothsayer will interpret the fortune on the paper for the worshiper. Often the same piece of fortune is taken to multiple booths for verification purposes. Some booths offer palm reading service. Recently, Taoist weddings have been performed here. Operation. The temple is open from 7:00am to 5:30pm throughout the year, and runs overnight in the Lunar New Year Eve. It is currently administrated by Sik Sik Yuen, a Taoist organization in Hong Kong. "
wikipedia-375409," English Springer Spaniel  The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. It is an affectionate, excitable breed with an average lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. Descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century, the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to ""rage syndrome"", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely with the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller ""cockers"" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or ""spring,"" game. In 1902, the Kennel Club of England recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term ""springer"" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would ""spring"" (flush) birds into the air. Description. The English Springer Spaniel is a medium sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial. Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog is docked by a few inches in comparison to the show dog. Field-bred dogs are selected for nose, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance. Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, dewlaps and dangling flews. The tail is docked to a short stub in those countries that permit docking. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers. The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance the only major difference is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle, their eyes are not as prominent and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the English Springer is that the Welsh have more limited colours and tend to be slightly smaller. Coat & Colours. Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months, but shed occasionally in the autumn. The coat comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking. Sizes. Males in the show dog line average approximately at the withers and weigh on average . According to the UK (FCI) Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be at the withers. The females should be and usually . Working types can be lighter in weight and finer in bone. Temperament. The typical Springer is friendly, eager to please, quick to learn and willing to obey. An affectionate and easy-going family dog, its alertness and attentiveness make it the ideal hunting companion. The English Springer Spaniel ranks 13th in Stanley Coren's ""The Intelligence of Dogs"", considered an excellent working dog. It has exceptional stamina and needs moderate amounts of activity, to focus its mind and to provide exercise, although this is different for each dog. Its long-legged build makes it among the fastest of the spaniels. It is a sociable breed that enjoys the company of children and handles the company of other pets well. If left alone for too long, they can become destructive and mischievous through boredom. They love the water, and tend to get wet whenever they have the chance. Health. As in most breeds, there are some health problems that are more likely to occur. Hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joints that leads to arthritis, and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which is a degeneration of the retina causing vision loss leading to blindness, are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers. Another problem can be elbow dysplasia. Retinal dysplasia (RD), which can cause blindness and Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK), which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the English springer spaniel should be screened prior to breeding. Health issues are usually similar in both types of English Springer however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines, however carriers in show lines have been identified. As with most spaniels and floppy eared dogs, they are prone to ear infections. Treatment including cleaning the ear canal weekly with a solution that will leave the ear in an acidic state to retard the growth of yeast and bacteria.  Other health problems include autoimmune diseases, which include allergies and other sensitivities to the environment. They can also be susceptible to various eye problems including inward or outward curling eyelashes or even an additional row of eyelashes, all of which can require corrective surgery. They tend to gain weight easily, and owners need to be careful about their food consumption. Skills. An English Springer Spaniel is foremost an upland flushing dog. There are a number of skills that breeders train the dog to perform for their occupation. History. English physician Dr. John Caius described the spaniel in his book the ""Treatise of Englishe Dogs"" published in 1576. His book was the first work to describe the various British breeds by function. By 1801, Sydenham Edwards explained in the ""Cynographia Britannica"" that the land spaniel should be split into two kinds, the Springing, Hawking Spaniel, or Starter, and the Cocking or Cocker Spaniel. At this point in time, both cocker spaniels and springer spaniels were born in the same litters. The purpose of the breed was to serve as a hunting dog. The smaller cockers were used to hunt woodcock, while their larger littermates, the springer spaniels, would ""spring""—or flush—the gamebird into the air where a trained falcon or hawk would bring it to the handler. Many spaniel breeds were developed during the 19th century, and often named after the counties in which they were developed, or after their owners, who were usually nobility. Two strains of larger land spaniel were predominant and were said to have been of ""true springer type."" These were the Norfolk and the Shropshire spaniels, and by the 1850s, these were shown under the breed name of Norfolk spaniel. In January 1899, the Spaniel Club of England and the Sporting Spaniel Society held their trials together for the first time. Two years later, in 1902, a combination of the physical standard from the Spaniel Club of England and the ability standard from the Sporting Spaniel Society led to the English Springer Spaniel breed being officially recognised by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club followed in 1910. In 1914, the first English Field Champion was crowned, FTC Rivington Sam, whose dam was a registered cocker spaniel, Rivington Riband. Sam is considered one of the foundation sires for modern field lines. Use as sniffer dogs. Springer Spaniels are commonly used as sniffer dogs for a variety of tasks. Notable cases of explosive search dogs have included Buster, a Dickin Medal recipient, Royal Army Veterinary Corps arms and explosives search dog serving with the Duke of Wellington's Regiment in Iraq, for finding an extremist group's hidden arsenal of weapons and explosives. Another example is Jake, aka Hubble Keck People's Dispensary for Sick Animals Gold Medal and Blue Cross Animal Hospital Medal recipient, a London Metropolitan Police explosives search dog. He was deployed at Tavistock Square, Russell Square and King's Cross following the 7 July 2005 London Bombings. However the Springer's use is not limited to detection of explosives, it can extend to other work. Murphy, a male Springer has been trained by HM Prison Service in HMP Norwich to search for mobile phones. He can tell the difference between the guards' phones and illegal phones held by inmates. Other varied uses for the Springer can include sniffing out bumblebee nests, illegal immigrants, and blood. Springer Spaniels are also used as search and rescue dogs for mountain rescue teams where their willingness to work and cover rough terrain makes them an excellent choice alongside other more traditional search dog breeds. Springers are used as drug dogs by agencies in various places including Sweden, Finland, Britain, Isle of Man, and Qatar. "
wikipedia-375411," Miniature Schnauzer  The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers developed from crosses between the Standard Schnauzer and one or more smaller breeds such as the Poodle and Affenpinscher, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as ""spunky"" but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dog's predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally. The breed remains one of the most popular world wide, primarily for its temperament and relatively small size. As of 2008 it is the 11th most popular breed in the U.S. History. The earliest records surrounding development of the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899. The AKC accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. Although they are recognized internationally with the Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer in the Working group, in the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display. In 2008, Miniature Schnauzers were the 11th most popular breed in the U.S. Description. Appearance. Miniature Schnauzers have a very square-shaped build, measuring tall and weighing for females and for males. They have a double coat, with wiry exterior fur and a soft undercoat. In show trim, the coat is kept short on the body, but the fur on the ears, legs, belly, and face is retained. Recognized coat colors are black, salt and pepper, black and silver, and pure white. Miniature Schnauzers are often described as non-moulting dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable. They are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a ""scissor bite""; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when cropped, the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called ""cat feet"") with thick, black pads. North American white Schnauzer controversy. The white Schnauzer is one of four color varieties of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the World Canine Organization. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AKC chooses not to recognize white dogs. Temperament. The American Kennel Club breed standard describes temperament as ""alert and spirited, yet obedient to command... friendly, intelligent and willing to please... never overaggressive or timid."" Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, upon which they are typically very friendly to them. They are highly playful dogs, and, if not given the outlet required for their energy, they can become bored and invent their own ""fun"". Miniature Schnauzers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking. Schnauzers have a high prey drive, which means they may attack other small pets such as birds, snakes, and rodents. Many will also attack cats, but this may be curbed with training, or if the dog is raised with cats. Health and grooming. A UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of Miniature Schnauzers at a little over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to ""comedone syndrome"", a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, which can be treated with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations should be part of the regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. Schnauzers have a specific groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls. "
wikipedia-375416," Computer simulation  A computer simulation, a computer model, or a computational model is a computer program, run on a single computer, or a network of computers, that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions. Computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes to network-based groups of computers running for hours to ongoing simulations that run for days. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program Other examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; a 2.64-million-atom model of the complex maker of protein in all organisms, a ribosome, in 2005; a complete simulation of the life cycle of Mycoplasma genitalium in 2012; and the Blue Brain project at EPFL (Switzerland), begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level. Because of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification. Simulation versus model. A computer model refers to the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, a computer simulation refers to the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, refers to the result of running a model. In other words, you would not ""build a simulation"". You would ""build a model"", and then either ""run a model"" or ""run a simulation"". History. Computer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the Manhattan Project in World War II to model the process of nuclear detonation. It was a simulation of 12 hard spheres using a Monte Carlo algorithm. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible. Data preparation. The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models). Input sources also vary widely: Lastly, the time at which data is available varies: Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized simulation languages. The best-known may be Simula (sometimes called Simula-67, after the year 1967 when it was proposed). There are now many others. Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the accuracy (compared to measurement resolution and precision) of the values are. Often they are expressed as ""error bars"", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an ""error analysis"" to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate. Even small errors in the original data can accumulate into substantial error later in the simulation. While all computer analysis is subject to the ""GIGO"" (garbage in, garbage out) restriction, this is especially true of digital simulation. Indeed, observation of this inherent, cumulative error in digital systems was the origin of chaos theory. Types. Computer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including: Another way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes: Equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted. CGI computer simulation. Formerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation parameters. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in mathematical models. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by computer-generated-imagery (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or spout math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and ""see that rain was headed their way"") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud coordinates. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, weather forecasting models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events. Similarly, CGI computer simulations of CAT scans can simulate how a tumor might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes. Other applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run. Computer simulation in science. Generic examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description: Specific examples of computer simulations follow: Notable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: Donella Meadows' World3 used in the ""Limits to Growth"", James Lovelock's Daisyworld and Thomas Ray's Tierra. Simulation environments for physics and engineering. Graphical environments to design simulations have been developed. Special care was taken to handle events (situations in which the simulation equations are not valid and have to be changed). The open project Open Source Physics was started to develop reusable libraries for simulations in Java, together with Easy Java Simulations, a complete graphical environment that generates code based on these libraries. Computer simulation in practical contexts. Computer simulations are used in a wide variety of practical contexts, such as: The reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the validity of the simulation model, therefore verification and validation are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in stochastic simulations, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and computer games. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly. Vehicle manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype. Computer graphics can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. Animations can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in training simulations. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of scientific visualization. In debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect buffer overflow and similar ""hard to detect"" errors as well as produce performance information and tuning data. Pitfalls. Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the Monte Carlo method. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures. Model calibration techniques. The following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models: calibration, verification, and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool. Model calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied. Model verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process. The final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models. Validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district. Three sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration: input error, model error, and parameter error. In general, input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the user. Model error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent. In order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results, these are the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories, but they are only valid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactory estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained, the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the intended functions. The validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic patterns. The importance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning, thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. Efforts should be made to ensure collected data is consistent with expected values. For example, in traffic analysis it is typical for a traffic engineer to perform a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. The resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation.

wikipedia-375446," 2007 Rugby World Cup  The 2007 Rugby World Cup was the sixth Rugby World Cup, a quadrennial international rugby union competition inaugurated in 1987. Twenty nations competed for the Webb Ellis Cup in the tournament, which was hosted by France from 7 September to 20 October. France won the hosting rights in 2003, beating a bid from England. The competition consisted of 48 matches over 44 days; 42 matches were played in ten cities throughout France, as well as four in Cardiff, Wales, and two in Edinburgh, Scotland. The eight quarter-finalists from 2003 were granted automatic qualification, while 12 other nations gained entry through the regional qualifying competitions that began in 2004 – of them, Portugal was the only World Cup debutant. The top three nations from each pool at the end of the pool stage qualified automatically for the 2011 World Cup. The competition opened with a match between hosts France and Argentina on 7 September at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, outside Paris. The stadium was also the venue of the final match between England and South Africa on 20 October, which South Africa won by 15 points to 6, their second World Cup title. Bids. Both England and France bid to host the tournament. The tender document for the 2007 bidding process was due out on 31 October 2001. Both England and France were invited to re-submit their plans. The International Rugby Board (IRB) stated that both countries must comply with tender document terms in one bid, but in their second option, could propose alternative ideas. The IRB said ""England's original proposal contained three plans for hosting the tournament with a traditional, new and hybrid format all on offer... The French bid, while complying with the tender document in all other respects, fell outside one of the `windows` in which the IRB wanted to stage an event"". England's bids included a two-tier tournament and altering the structure of the qualifying tournament and France had a bid in September/October. It was announced in April 2003 that France had won the right to host the tournament. The tournament was moved to the proposed September–October dates with the tournament structure remaining as it was. It was also announced that ten French cities would be hosting games, with the final at the Stade de France. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that ""this decision illustrates the qualities of our country and its capacity to host major sporting events...This World Cup will be the opportunity to showcase the regions of France where the wonderful sport of rugby is deeply rooted"". French Sports Minister Jean-Francois Lamour said that ""The organisation of this World Cup will shine over all of France because ten French towns have the privilege of organising matches and to be in the world's spotlight."" French cities to host games were Bordeaux, Lens, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, St. Etienne, Toulouse and Paris, and it was also announced that the final would be at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. Qualifying. The eight quarter-finalists from the 2003 World Cup all received automatic entry, with the other 12 nations coming from qualifying series around the world. Ten of the 20 positions available in the tournament were filled by regional qualifiers, with an additional two being filled by repechage qualification. The qualifying tournament was divided into five regional groups; Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. Qualifying matches began in 2004 and were completed in early 2007. Including the automatic qualifiers, over 90 nations were in qualifying contention for the final tournament. In July 2005, both Samoa and Fiji were confirmed as the qualifiers from Oceania, as Oceania 1 and 2 respectively. In July of the following year, Argentina qualified as Americas 1 by defeating Uruguay 26–0 in Buenos Aires. Americas 2 was filled in August when Canada defeated the United States 56–7 in Newfoundland. The United States went on to qualify as Americas 3 after beating Uruguay in a two-legged tie in early October. That month also saw Italy qualify as Europe 1 after defeating Russia 67–7 in Moscow, reaching the first place in its qualifying group; Romania defeated Spain 43–20 in Madrid, and also qualified for the World Cup as Europe 2. Namibia qualified for their third consecutive World Cup after they earned their spot in France by defeating Morocco over two legs in November. In late 2006, it was announced that the IRB had withdrawn Colombo as the venue of the final Asian qualifying tournament due to security problems. Japan won the only Asian allocation after the tournament was moved to Hong Kong. Georgia was 14 points the better of Portugal over two legs to claim the last European place. Tonga qualified through repechage after defeating Korea. The final spot went to Portugal, joining Pool C after beating Uruguay 24–23 on aggregate. Portugal's qualification was the only change in the 20-team roster from the 2003 World Cup, replacing Uruguay, becoming the only wholly amateur team to qualify. Hosting. France won the right to host the 2007 World Cup in 2003, and it was subsequently announced that four matches would be held in Wales, at Cardiff's 74,500 seat Millennium Stadium (two Pool B games involving Wales, the match between Fiji and Canada, and a quarter-final). Ireland was to have hosted matches at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, but opted out because the stadium was being redeveloped. Two of Scotland's Pool C matches were played at Murrayfield Stadium in Scotland. The Scottish Rugby Union was reportedly having doubts in early 2006 about hosting these games and whether Scotland would generate enough market demand, but confirmed in April 2006 that the games would be played at Murrayfield. In the end, the Scotland v. New Zealand match failed to sellout, and the stadium was less than half-full for the Scotland v. Romania match. There was a substantial increase in the overall capacity of stadiums compared to the 2003 Rugby World Cup – the smallest venue at the 2007 tournament could seat 33,900 people. The French venues were the same as those used for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Around 6,000 volunteers helped to organise the competition. Although the 2007 tournament was the first to be hosted primarily by France, a number of matches during the 1991 and 1999 tournaments were played in France. In 1991, matches in Pool D (which included France) were played in Béziers, Bayonne, Grenoble, Toulouse, Brive and Agen, while Parc des Princes and Stadium Lille-Metropole each hosted a quarter-final. Similarly, in 1999, fixtures in Pool C (which included France) were played in Béziers, Bordeaux and Toulouse, Stade Félix-Bollaert was the venue for one of the quarter-final play-offs, and the Stade de France hosted a quarter-final. Tickets and sponsorship. Ticket sales for the Rugby World Cup were broken up into three phases. The first phase was released in November 2005, when members of the European rugby community, such as officials, players and so on were given the opportunity for various packages. Upon the release of the second phase ticketing scheme, more than 100,000 tickets were sold in the first ten hours of release. The remaining tickets – individual tickets and tickets to the semi-finals – were released in phase three in November 2006. In June 2007, it was announced that 2 million of the 2.4 million tickets had been sold in advance of the tournament. The Worldwide partners for the tournament are Société Générale, GMF, Électricité de France, Peugeot, Visa and SNCF, and official sponsors include Heineken, Vediorbis, Capgemini, Orange, Toshiba and Emirates. Gilbert will be providing the tournament balls, the Gilbert Synergie match ball will be used throughout the tournament. This continues Gilbert's involvement with the World Cup, the company having provided the Barbarian (1995), Revolution (1999) and Xact (2003) balls in the past. Along with Gilbert, the official suppliers are Adidas, Coca-Cola, Clifford Chance, Goodyear and McDonald's. The host broadcaster for the event is TF1. Squads. Each country was allowed a squad of 30 players for the tournament. These squads were to be submitted to the International Rugby Board by a deadline of 14 August 2007. Once the squad was submitted a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. Match officials. The 2007 Rugby World Cup officials were appointed in late-April 2007, with 12 referees and 13 touch judges being chosen to officiate during the pool stage. In the knockout stage the 12 referees also acted as touch judges, with referee appointments being based on performance from previous matches and selection for neutrality. Referees came from seven different nationalities and three of them made their Rugby World Cup debut. The touch judges came from 10 different countries. Tony Spreadbury of England officiated the opening game between France and Argentina at the Stade de France and Irishman Alain Rolland refereed the final. Format. The competition was contested over 44 days between 20 different nations, over 48 fixtures. The tournament began on 7 September at the Stade de France with a match between the host nation, France, and Argentina. The tournament culminated at the same venue on 20 October for the Final between England and South Africa. Pool stage. Classification within each pool was based on the following scoring system: Bonus points, contributing to a team's cumulative match-point score, were awarded in each of the following instances (one match point for each event): At the end of the pool stage, teams were ranked from first to fifth based on cumulative match points, with the top two nations proceeding to the quarter-finals. If at the completion of the pool phase two or more Teams were level on Match points, then the following criteria would have been used in the following order until one of the Teams could be determined as the higher ranked: By elevating head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), a notable difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams with the same number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences at the end of the pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not tell the whole story. Knockout stage. From this stage onwards, the tournament adopted a knockout format comprising eight fixtures: four quarter-finals, two semi-finals, a bronze medal match, and the final. The winner and runner-up from each of the four pools advanced to the quarter-finals. Pool winners were drawn against opposite pool runners-up in the quarter-finals, e.g. the winner of Pool A faced the runner up of Pool B, and the winner of Pool B faced the runner-up of Pool A. Each match in the knockout stage must conclude in a victory. If, after eighty minutes of normal play, a match results in a draw, further play is made to determine an outright winner. Initially, there will be two periods of extra time, 10 minutes each way; if there is no winner after this, then play proceeds to a single 10-minute period of 'sudden death' play. If the contest is unresolved after a total 110 minutes of open play, the winner will be determined by a placekicking competition. Effect on 2011 qualification. In a change from the format of the previous tournament, the top three teams in each pool will qualify for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand; previously, only the eight quarter-finalists gained an automatic place in the following tournament.

wikipedia-375451," Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang  Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, earlier known as Empress Xiaozhuangwen (Manchu: ""Hiyoošungga Ambalinggū Genggiyenšu Hūwanghu""; 28 March 1613 – 27 January 1688), was a concubine of the Qing Dynasty ruler Hong Taiji, who was declared his spouse officially although not his first wife and she became empress in 1636. She better known historically after becoming the empress dowager. She was the mother of Hong Taiji's successor, the Shunzhi Emperor, and grandmother of Shunzhi's successor, the Kangxi Emperor. She wielded significant influence in the Qing imperial court during the reigns of her son and especially, during that of her grandson. Known for her wisdom and political insight, Empress Xiaozhuangwen is a respected figure in the history of the Qing Dynasty. Biography. Empress Xiaozhuangwen was born of the Mongol Borjigit clan. Her father Jaisang (寨桑), a ""beile"" of the Khorchin Mongols, was a descendant of Hasar, a younger brother of Genghis Khan. Although her personal name was ""Bumbutai"" (Manchu: ). Bumbutai became Hong Taiji's concubine in 1625 when she was 12 years old. She bore Hong Taiji three daughters and a son, Fulin. Her aunt Jere was Hong Taiji's empress consort, and she also became an empress dowager after Hong Taiji's death. Hong Taiji did not leave behind a will after his death in 1643, and this resulted in a struggle for succession among his brothers and eldest son, Hooge. Daišan and Dorgon, Hong Taiji's brothers, agreed that Fulin should be the successor, and they pledged to serve Fulin with absolute loyalty. Fulin ascended to the throne as the Shunzhi Emperor. Hooge was not pleased with this arrangement and argued that he should be the rightful successor because he was the eldest son. Hooge was eventually put under house arrest by Dorgon and died during his confinement. Dorgon became regent and was in charge of making decisions for the Shunzhi Emperor because the latter was still young. The relationship between Dorgon and the Shunzhi Emperor has been a topic for discussion among historians. When Dorgon died in 1650, Shunzhi posthumously stripped him off his titles and had Dorgon's corpse mutilated. It is believed, but not historically verified, that Bumubutai married Dorgon after Hong Taiji's death, since levirate marriage was a common practice among Mongols then. This was considered to be a reason as to why Dorgon and his brother Dodo were posthumously stripped off their titles of nobility. Bumbutai kept a low profile during the reign of her son, the Shunzhi Emperor, and had little interference in politics. Shunzhi died in 1661 and was succeeded by his son Xuanye, who became known as the Kangxi Emperor. Bumbutai advised her grandson to learn from the Four Regents (appointed by the Shunzhi Emperor before his death to aid the Kangxi Emperor). She also took charge of the Kangxi Emperor's upbringing after the death of the emperor's mother. When the Kangxi Emperor came to of age and officially took personal control of the government in 1667, he faced the threat of the growing influence of Oboi, one of the Four Regents. Two years later, Bumbutai assisted her grandson in making plans to get rid of Oboi — Oboi was lured into a trap, placed under arrest, and stripped of his power. Throughout her life, Bumbutai disliked living in the palace, despite its luxurious conditions. She also refused to hold any birthday celebrations as she felt that it would be costly. When Bumbutai fell sick in the autumn of 1687, the Kangxi Emperor personally took care of his grandmother. Bumbutai died a year later in 1688 and was interred in the Zhaoling Mausoleum in Shenyang, Liaoning. "
wikipedia-375462," Daniel Maclise  Daniel Maclise (25 January 1806 – 25 April 1870) was an Irish history, literary and portrait painter, and illustrator, who worked for most of his life in London, England. Early life. Maclise was born in Cork City, Ireland, the son of Alexander McLish (also known as McLeish, McLish, McCLisse or McLise), a tanner or shoemaker, but formerly a Scottish Highlander soldier. His education was of the plainest kind, but he was eager for culture, fond of reading, and anxious to become an artist. His father, however, placed him in employment, in 1820, in Newenham's Bank, where he remained for two years, before leaving to study at the Cork School of Art. In 1825 it happened that Sir Walter Scott was travelling in Ireland, and young Maclise, having seen him in a bookseller's shop, made a surreptitious sketch of the great man, which he afterwards lithographed. It became very popular, and led to many commissions for portraits, which he executed, in pencil. Various influential friends recognised Maclise's genius and promise, and were anxious to furnish him with the means of studying in London; but refusing all financial assistance, he saved the money himself and arrived in the capital on 18 July 1827. There he made a sketch of Charles John Kean, the actor, which, like his portrait of Scott, was lithographed and published, making the artist a considerable sum. He entered the Royal Academy schools in 1828, eventually being awarded the highest prizes open to students. Career. Maclise exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1829.  Gradually he began to confine himself more exclusively to subject and historical pictures, varied occasionally by portraits – such as those of Lord Campbell, novelist Letitia Landon, Dickens, and other of his literary friends.  In 1833, he exhibited two pictures which greatly increased his reputation, and in 1835 the ""Chivalric Vow of the Ladies"" and the ""Peacock"" procured his election as associate of the Academy, of which he became full member in 1840.  The years that followed were occupied with a long series of figure pictures, deriving their subjects from history and tradition and from the works of Shakespeare, Goldsmith and Le Sage. He also designed illustrations for several of Dickens's Christmas books and other works. Between the years 1830 and 1836 he contributed to ""Fraser's Magazine"", under the pseudonym of Alfred Croquis, a remarkable series of portraits of the literary and other celebrities of the time – character studies, etched or lithographed in outline, and touched more or less with the emphasis of the caricaturist, which were afterwards published as the ""Maclise Portrait Gallery"" (1871). During the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in London in 1834-1850 by Charles Barry, Maclise was commissioned in 1846 to paint murals in the House of Lords on such subjects as ""Justice"" and ""Chivalry"". In 1858, Maclise commenced one of the two great monumental works of his life, ""The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher"", on the walls of Westminster Palace. It was begun in fresco, a process which proved unmanageable. The artist wished to resign the task, but, encouraged by Prince Albert, he studied in Berlin the new method of water-glass painting, and carried out the subject and its companion, ""The Death of Nelson"", in that medium, completing the latter painting in 1864. Maclise's vast painting of ""The Marriage of Strongbow and Aoife"" (1854) hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. It portrays the marriage of the main Norman conqueror of Ireland ""Strongbow"" to the daughter of his Gaelic ally. By the grand staircase of Halifax Town Hall, which was completed in 1863, there is a wall painting by Maclise. The intense application which he gave to these great historic works, and various circumstances connected with the commission, had a serious effect on the artist's health. He began to shun the company in which he formerly delighted, his old buoyancy of spirits was gone, and when, in 1865, the presidency of the Royal Academy was offered to him he declined the honor. He died of acute pneumonia on 25 April 1870 at his home 4 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. His works are distinguished by powerful intellectual and imaginative qualities, but somewhat marred by harsh and dull coloring, by metallic hardness of surface and texture, and by frequent touches of the theatrical in the action and attitudes of the figures. His fame rests most securely on his two greatest works at Westminster. A memoir of Maclise, by his friend William Justin O'Driscoll, was published in 1871. Cork Exhibition 2008. The Crawford Gallery in Cork, Ireland, Maclise's native town, held a major exhibition of his works from October 2008, opened by David Puttnam.

wikipedia-375474," Abel Gance  Abel Gance (25 October 188910 November 1981) was a French film director and producer, writer and actor. He is best known for three major silent films: ""J'accuse"" (1919), ""La Roue"" (1923), and the monumental ""Napoléon"" (1927). Early life. Born in Paris in 1889, Abel Gance was the illegitimate son of a prosperous doctor, Abel Flamant, and a working class mother, Françoise Péréthon (or Perthon). Initially taking his mother's name, he was brought up until the age of eight by his maternal grandparents in the coal mining town of Commentry in central France. He then returned to Paris to rejoin his mother who had by then married Adolphe Gance, a chauffeur and mechanic, whose name Abel then adopted. Although he later fabricated the history of a brilliant school career and middle-class background, Gance left school at the age of 14, and the love of literature and art which sustained him throughout his life was in part the result of self-education. He started working as a clerk in a solicitor's office, but after a couple of years he turned to acting in the theatre. When he was 18, he was given a season's contract at the Théâtre Royal du Parc in Brussels, where he developed friendships with the actor Victor Francen and the writer Blaise Cendrars. Silent films. While in Brussels, Gance wrote his first film scenarios, which he sold to Léonce Perret. Back in Paris in 1909, he acted in his first film, Perret's ""Molière"". At that stage he regarded the cinema as ""infantile and stupid"" and was only drawn into film jobs by his poverty, but he nevertheless continued to write scenarios, and often sold them to Gaumont. During this period he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, often fatal at that time, but after a period of retreat in Vittel he overcame the disease. With some friends he established a production company, Le Film Français, and began directing his own films in 1911 with ""La Digue (ou Pour sauver la Hollande)"", a historical film which featured the first screen appearance of Pierre Renoir. Gance tried to maintain a connection with the theatre and he finished writing a monumental tragedy entitled ""Victoire de Samothrace"", in which he hoped that Sarah Bernhardt would star. Its five-hour length, and Gance's refusal to cut it, proved to be a stumbling block. With the outbreak of World War I, Gance was rejected from the army on medical grounds and in 1915 he started writing and directing for a new film company, Film d'Art. He soon caused controversy with ""La Folie du docteur Tube"", a comic fantasy in which he and his cameraman Léonce-Henry Burel created some arresting visual effects with distorting mirrors. The producers were outraged and refused to show the film. Gance nevertheless continued working for Film d'Art until 1918, making over a dozen commercially successful films. His experiments included tracking shots, extreme close-ups, low-angle shots, and split-screen images. His subjects moved steadily away from simple action films towards psychological melodramas, such as ""Mater dolorosa"" (1917) starring Emmy Lynn as a neglected wife who has an affair with her husband's brother. The film was a great commercial success, and it was followed by ""La Dixième Symphonie"", another marital drama featuring Emmy Lynn. Here Gance's mastery of lighting, composition and editing was accompanied by a range of literary and artistic references which some critics found pretentious and alienating. In 1917, Gance was at last drafted into the Army, in its Service Cinématographique, an episode which proved futile and short-lived, but it deepened his preoccupation with the impact of the war and the depression which was caused by the deaths of many of his friends. When he parted company with Film d'Art over a shortage of funds, Charles Pathé stepped in to underwrite his next film, ""J'accuse"" (1919), in which Gance confronted the waste and suffering which the war had brought. He re-enlisted himself into the Service Cinématographique in order to be able to film some scenes on a real battlefield at the front. The film made a powerful impact and went on to have international distribution. In 1920 Gance developed his next project, ""La Roue"", while recuperating in Nice from Spanish flu, and its progress was deeply affected by the knowledge that his companion Ida Danis was dying of tuberculosis; furthermore, his leading man and friend Séverin-Mars was also seriously ill (and died soon after completion of the film). Nevertheless Gance brought an unprecedented level of energy and imagination to the technical realisation of his story, set firstly against the dark and grimy background of locomotives and railway yards, and then among the snow-covered landscapes of the Alps. He employed elaborate editing techniques and innovative use of rapid cutting which made the film highly influential among other contemporary directors. The finished film was originally in 32 reels and ran for nearly 9 hours, but it was subsequently edited down for distribution and it is these shorter versions which have survived. In 1921 Gance visited America to promote ""J'accuse"". During his five-month stay he met D. W. Griffith whom he had long admired. He was also offered a contract with MGM to work in Hollywood, but he turned it down. After a brief change of pace for ""Au secours"", a comic film with Max Linder, Gance embarked on his greatest project, a six-part life of ""Napoléon"". Only the first part was completed, tracing Bonaparte's early life, through the Revolution, and up to the invasion of Italy, but even this occupied a vast canvas with meticulously recreated historical scenes and scores of characters. The film was full of experimental techniques, combining rapid cutting, hand-held cameras, superimposition of images, and, most famously, his wide-screen sequences achieved, with a system he called Polyvision, by using triple cameras (and projectors) to create a spectacular panoramic effect, including a finale in which the outer two film panels were tinted blue and red, creating a widescreen image of a French flag. The original version of the film ran for around 6 hours. A shortened version received a triumphant première at the Paris Opéra in April 1927 before a distinguished audience that included the future General de Gaulle. The length was reduced still further for French and European distribution, and it became even shorter when it was shown in America. This was not the end of the film's career however. Gance re-used material from it in later films, and the triumphant restoration of the silent film in the 1980s (see below) confirmed it as his most famous work. Sound films. Gance embraced the arrival of sound with enthusiasm and his first production was ""La Fin du monde"" (1931), an expensive science-fiction film (first planned in 1913/14) about the imminent collision of a comet with the Earth. Gance himself played the leading role. The film was a critical and commercial disaster, and thereafter the creative independence which Gance had enjoyed in the previous decade was seriously curtailed. Gance continued to be a busy film-maker throughout the 1930s, but he characterised most of the films made during this period as ones that he did ""not in order to live, but in order not to die"". In 1932 he tried to demonstrate his credentials as a reliable and efficient director by filming a remake of ""Mater dolorosa"" which he completed within 18 days and within budget. Among the other 'commercial' works that followed were ""Lucrèce Borgia"" (1935), with Edwige Feuillère, and ""Un Grand Amour de Beethoven"" (1937), with Harry Baur. One of the more personal projects that he was able to undertake was a new version of ""J'accuse"" (1938), not so much a remake of his 1919 film as a continuation of it, and conceived as a warning against the new war that he saw impending. After the invasion of France in 1940, Gance filmed a popular melodrama called ""Vénus aveugle"", which he saw as an allegory of the current state of France and a message of hope directed to the ordinary French people in their time of misfortune. At this period Gance was among those who saw Philippe Pétain as the means of the country's salvation, and in September 1941 ""Vénus aveugle"" had its first screening in Vichy, preceded by a speech in which Gance paid tribute to Pétain. After completing one more film, ""Le Capitaine Fracasse"", Gance went to Spain in August 1943, citing growing hostility from the German authorities in France, and he remained there until October 1945. After the war, his difficulties in getting support for his projects increased and he made few films. The historical melodrama ""La Tour de Nesle"" (1954) was his first film in colour, and it provoked some revival of interest in his work, with critics such as François Truffaut making the case for Gance as a neglected ""auteur"" of genius. Gance returned to Napoleonic spectacle with ""Austerlitz"" (1960), and made a further historical pageant in ""Cyrano et d'Artagnan"" (1963), before moving into television for his final works, also on historical subjects. Throughout his life Gance kept returning to ""Napoléon"", often editing his own footage into shorter versions, adding a soundtrack, sometimes filming new material, and as a result the original 1927 film was lost from view for decades. After various attempts at reconstruction, the dedicated work of the film historian Kevin Brownlow produced a five-hour version of the film, still incomplete but fuller than anyone had seen since the 1920s. This version was presented at the Telluride Film Festival in August 1979, with the frail 89-year old director in attendance. The occasion brought a belated triumph to Gance's career, and subsequent performances and further restoration made his name known to a worldwide audience. Abel Gance married three times: in 1912 to Mathilde Thizeau; in 1922 to Marguerite Danis (sister of Ida); in 1933 to Marie-Odette Vérité (Sylvie Grenade), who died in 1978. Gance died of tuberculosis in Paris in 1981 at the age of 92. Reputation. Gance wanted himself to be seen as ""the Victor Hugo of the screen"", and many assessments have recognised the ambition, the ingenuity and the sweeping romanticism of his films. Some, such as Léon Moussinac in the 1920s, have pointed to the contradictions in his work between creativity and cliché, the ""abundance of original treasures and of banal mediocrity and of poor taste"". One thing that has always been acknowledged is Gance's innovations in the techniques of the cinema. As well as his multiscreen ventures with Polyvision, he explored the use of superimposition of images, extreme close-ups, and fast rhythmic editing, and he made the camera mobile in unorthodox ways – hand-held, mounted on wires or a pendulum, or even strapped to a horse. He also made early experiments with the addition of sound to film, and with filming in colour and in 3-D. There were few aspects of film technique that he did not seek to incorporate in his work, and his influence was acknowledged by contemporaries such as Jean Epstein and later by film-makers of the French New Wave. In the assessment of Kevin Brownlow, ""...with his silent productions, ""J'accuse"", ""La Roue"", and ""Napoléon"", Gance made a fuller use of the medium than anyone before or since"". Another aspect of Gance's work which has drawn comment from critics is the political stance and implication of his life and films, particularly his identification with strong military leaders. Whereas ""J'accuse"" in 1919 suggested Gance's pacifist and anti-establishment attitude, the reactions to ""Napoléon"" in 1927 saw greater ambivalence, and some commentators even judged it to be an apologia for dictatorship. This strand of criticism of Gance's reactionary politics has continued through later assessments of him; it has also noted his ardent support for Pétain in the early years of World War II, and subsequently for Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s. Others have regarded these political interpretations as secondary to Gance's mastery of exuberant spectacle, which frequently had a nationalistic focus. As one obituary concluded, ""Abel Gance was perhaps the greatest Romantic of the screen"". "
wikipedia-375479," China Mobile  China Mobile Limited () is a Chinese state-owned telecommunication company that provides mobile voice and multimedia services through its nationwide mobile telecommunications network. The company is one of the largest mobile telecommunications companies by market capitalization today, and it was named as such in March 2011. It is listed on both the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchange.  As of July 2013, China Mobile is the world's largest mobile phone operator by subscribers with about 740 million. History. A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China and also a public company that is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges, China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception. As of 2010 China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share. China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively. Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited, China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecom. (This company continues to provide mobile services, however.) State control. China Mobile likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China's government but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs. Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited, which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors. Established in 2000, CMCC is China Mobile Ltd's current parent company as of 2011. Rural subscriber base. China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors. By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population, and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.  China Mobile also offers information services targeted at the rural market, including the Agricultural Information Service, which allows a variety of activities to take place through the use of mobile phones and the Internet. These include the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc. Overseas activities. China Mobile expanded overseas in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan launching the ZONG brand there a year later. In February 2013, China Mobile together with Vodafone, has participated in bidding for one of the two newly opened Myanmar Mobile licences. Domestic acquisitions. In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China, adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services. Network. China Mobile operates a GSM network, which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in Mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too. GPRS is utilized for data transmission. The company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market. As of May 2012, its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base, which is an increase from 3% in 2010.  Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China as of 2010.  As of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, city-wide demonstration networks in the future. As of May 2012, such networks are in operation. While prior iPhone models couldn't use the China Mobile network because it relies on a China-only 3G standard, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G Apple iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012.  In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest. In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands. Service brands. China Mobile uses other names to differentiate its offerings. Mainland China. China Mobile offers mobile services in Mainland China under several brands. "
wikipedia-375482," Oka Crisis  The Oka Crisis was a land dispute between a group of Mohawk people and the town of Oka, Quebec, Canada which began on July 11, 1990 and lasted until September 26, 1990. One person died as a result. The dispute was the first well-publicized violent conflict between First Nations and the Canadian government in the late 20th century. The crisis developed from a local dispute between the town of Oka and the Mohawk community of Kanesatake. The town of Oka was developing plans to expand a golf course and residential development onto land which had traditionally been used by the Mohawk. It included pineland and a burial ground, marked by standing tombstones of their ancestors. The Mohawks had filed a land claim for the sacred grove and burial ground near Kanesatake, but their claim had been rejected in 1986. Historical background. In 1717, the governor of New France granted the lands encompassing the cemetery and the pines to the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice or Sulpician Fathers Seminary, a Roman Catholic order based in Paris. The Mohawk claimed that the original grant included about nine square miles reserved exclusively for their use. Although the Sulpician Seminary was supposed to hold the land in trust for them, the seminary expanded this agreement to grant itself sole ownership rights. In 1868, one year after Confederation, the chief of the Oka Mohawk people, Joseph Onasakenrat, wrote a letter to the seminary condemning it for illegally holding the land and demanding its return. The petition produced no results for the Mohawks. In 1869 Onasakenrat attacked the seminary with a small armed force, after giving the missionaries eight days to hand over the land. Local authorities ended this stand-off with force. In 1936, the seminary sold the remaining territory for development and vacated the area, under protest by the local Mohawk community. At the time they still kept cattle on the common land. In 1961, the city built a private nine-hole golf course, the ""Club de golf d'Oka"", on a portion of the land. The Mohawk filed suit against its construction but, by the time the case was heard, much of the land had already been cleared. Construction also began on a parking lot and golf greens adjacent to the Mohawk cemetery. In 1977, the band filed an official land claim with the federal Office of Native Claims regarding the land. The claim was accepted for filing, and funds were provided for additional research of the claim. Nine years later, the claim was rejected, on the grounds of failing to meet key legal criteria. In March 1989, the ""Club de golf d'Oka"" announced plans to expand the golf course by an additional 9 holes. Protests by Mohawks and others, as well as concern from the Quebec Minister of the Environment, led to negotiations and a postponement of the project by the municipality in August. Immediate causes. The tensions between native and non-native people in Canada have been high around communities bordering reserves, mainly over competing uses of land. Such tensions contributed to the Oka Crisis. The immediate cause of the crisis was the 1989 announcement by the mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, that the remainder of the pines would be cleared to expand the private, members-only golf club course to eighteen holes. In addition, he had approved development of sixty luxury condominiums in a section of the pines. As the Office of Native Claims had rejected the Mohawk claim on the land three years earlier, his office did not consult the Mohawk on the plans. No environmental or historic preservation review was undertaken. Not all the people in Oka approved of the plans, but opponents found the mayor's office unwilling to discuss them. As a protest against a court decision to allow the golf course construction to proceed, some members of the Mohawk community erected a barricade blocking access to the area. Mayor Ouellette demanded compliance with the court order, but the protesters refused. Quebec's Ministry of Native Affairs John Ciaccia wrote a letter of support for the natives, stating that ""these people have seen their lands disappear without having been consulted or compensated, and that, in my opinion, is unfair and unjust, especially over a golf course."" Crisis. On July 11, the mayor asked the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), Quebec's provincial police force, to intervene with the Mohawk protest. He claimed there had been criminal activity at the barricade. The Mohawk people, in accordance with the Constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy, asked the women, the caretakers of the land and ""progenitors of the nation"", whether or not the arsenal which the warriors had amassed should remain. The women of the Mohawk Nation decided that the weapons should only be used if the SQ fired on the barricade and to use them as defensively as possible. A police emergency response team swiftly attacked the barricade by deploying tear gas canisters and flash bang grenades in an attempt to create confusion in the Mohawk ranks. It is unclear whether the police or Mohawks opened fire with gunshots first, but after a 15-minute gun battle, the police fell back, abandoning six cruisers and a bulldozer. The police's tear gas blew back at them. Although an initial account reported that 31-year-old SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay had been shot in the face during the firefight, a later inquest determined that the bullet which struck and eventually killed him, struck his ""left side below the armpit, an area not covered by bullet-proof vest"". The situation escalated as the local Mohawks were joined by natives from across the country and the United States, together refusing to dismantle their barricade. The Sûreté du Québec established their own blockades on highway 344 to restrict access to Oka and Kanesatake. Another group of Mohawks at the nearby location of Kahnawake, in solidarity with Kanesatake, blockaded the Mercier Bridge at the point where it passed through their territory, thereby sealing off a major access point between the Island of Montreal and Montreal's heavily populated South Shore suburbs. At the peak of the crisis, the Mercier Bridge and Routes 132, 138 and 207 were all blocked, creating substantial disruption to traffic and anger as the crisis dragged on. A group of Châteauguay residents started building an unauthorized, unplanned highway around the Kahnawake reserve. After the crisis, the highway was completed and is now part of Quebec Autoroute 30. The federal Crown-in-Council agreed to spend $5.3 million to purchase the section of the pines where the golf course expansion was to take place, to prevent any further development. This proposal left the Mohawks outraged, as the problems that led to the situation had not been addressed. Stewardship of the land had simply moved from one government to another, and not to the Mohawk. Frustration over traffic congestion and diversion due to the bridge and road blockades was occasionally expressed publicly. Residents of Châteauguay burned an effigy of a Mohawk warrior while chanting """"sauvages"""" (savages). Radio host Gilles Proulx raised tensions with comments such as, the Mohawks ""couldn't even speak French"". These remarks inflamed tempers that had been running especially high from comments preceding this crisis, including those by federal Member of Parliament for Chateauguay, Ricardo Lopez. When it became apparent that the Sûreté du Québec had not contained this escalating situation, the government brought in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who were also unable to contain the mobs and chaos associated with the blocked traffic; ten RCMP constables were hospitalized on August 14. On August 8, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa announced at a press conference that he had, as per Section 275 of the National Defence Act, requisited military support in ""aid of the civil power"". Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was reluctant to have the federal government and, in particular, the Canadian Army, so involved. Under the act, however, the Solicitor General of Quebec, under direction from the Premier of Quebec, had the right to requisition the armed forces to maintain law and order as a provincial responsibility; this move had precedent in Canada, including two decades earlier during the October Crisis. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General John de Chastelain, placed Quebec-based troops in support of the provincial authorities; some 2,500 regular and reserve troops from the 34 and 35 Canadian Brigade Groups and 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group were put on notice. On August 20, a company of the Royal 22e Régiment, led by Major Alain Tremblay, took over three barricades and arrived at the final blockade leading to the disputed area. There, they reduced the stretch of no man's land, originally implemented by the Sûreté du Québec before the barricade at the Pines, from 1.5 kilometers to 5 meters. Additional troops and mechanized equipment mobilized at staging areas around Montreal, while reconnaissance aircraft staged air photo missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence. Despite high tensions between the two sides, no shots were exchanged. Resolution. On August 29, at the Mercier Bridge blockade, the Mohawks negotiated an end to their protest with Lieutenant-Colonel Robin Gagnon, the 'Van Doo' commander responsible for monitoring the blockades along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River west of Montreal. This action further resulted in the resolution of the original siege on the Kahnawake reserve. Mohawks at Oka, however, felt betrayed at the loss of their most effective bargaining chip in the Mercier Bridge: once traffic began flowing again, the Quebec government rejected further negotiations pursuant to their original dispute concerning the Oka golf course expansion. September 25 witnessed the final engagement of the crisis: a Mohawk warrior walked around the perimeter of the blockade area with a long stick, setting off flares that had been originally installed by the Canadian Forces to alert them to individuals fleeing the area. The army turned a water hose on this man, but it lacked enough pressure to disperse the crowd surrounding him. This crowd taunted the soldiers and began throwing water balloons at them, but the incident did not escalate further. The following day the Mohawks laid down their arms, dismantled their guns and threw them in a fire, ceremonially burning tobacco and returning to the reserve. Many, however, were detained by the Canadian Forces and arrested by the SQ. The Oka Crisis lasted 78 days, and gunfire early in the crisis killed SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay. The golf course expansion which had originally triggered the crisis was cancelled by the mayor of Oka. The Oka Crisis galvanized, throughout Canada, a subsequent process of developing an First Nations Policing Policy to try to prevent future such events. In 1991, Ouellette was re-elected mayor of Oka by acclamation. He said of the crisis that his responsibilities as mayor required him to act as he did. Documentaries, books, and other references. The Oka Crisis was extensively documented and inspired numerous books and films. Canadian filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin has made documentaries about the Oka Crisis, including """" (1993) and ""Rocks at Whiskey Trench"" (2000). These and two additional documentaries on the crisis were all produced by the National Film Board of Canada: Christine Welsh directed ""Keepers of the Fire"" (1994), which documented the role of Mohawk women during the crisis, and Alec MacLeod created ""Acts of Defiance"" (1993). ""Montreal Gazette"" journalist Albert Nerenberg switched careers after smuggling a video camera behind the barricades and making his first documentary, called ""Okanada"". Micheal Baxendale and Craig MacLaine wrote ""This Land Is Our Land: The Mohawk Revolt at Oka"". Geoffrey York and Loreen Pindera's wrote ""People of the Pines: The People and the Legacy of Oka"" (1991). Donna Goodleaf wrote ""Entering the Warzone: A Mohawk Perspective on Resisting Invasions"", which was published by Theytus Books in 1995. Gerald R. Alfred, a Kahnawake Mohawk who was part of the band council during the crisis, and who later became a professor of political science, wrote ""Heeding the Voices of Our Ancestors: Kahnawake Mohawk Politics and the Rise of Native Nationalism"" (1995). This was based on his PhD dissertation, which examined the issues. John Ciaccia, the Minister of Native Affairs for Quebec at the time, wrote a book about the events related to the Oka Crisis. His book, entitled ""The Oka Crisis, A Mirror of the Soul"", was published in 2000. Robin Philpot wrote a book about English Canada's use of the crisis as a political tool following the failed Meech Lake Accord: ""Oka: dernier alibi du Canada anglais"" (1991). Joseph Tehwehron David, a Mohawk artist who became known for his role as a warrior during the Oka Crisis in 1990, developed a body of artistic work that was deeply influenced by his experience ""behind the wire"" in 1990. The Canadian punkrock band Propagandhi wrote a song titled ""Oka Everywhere"", which was released in 1995 on a 10-inch split album with I Spy. It was later re-released on their 1998 compilation album ""Where Quantity Is Job Number 1"". "
wikipedia-375499," Ontario Provincial Police  The Ontario Provincial Police (O.P.P.) () is the Provincial Police service for the province of Ontario, Canada. Overview. The OPP is the largest deployed police force in Ontario, and the second largest in Canada. The service is responsible for providing policing services throughout the province in areas lacking local police forces. It also provides specialized support to smaller municipal police forces, investigates province-wide and cross-jurisdictional crimes, patrols provincial highways (including Ontario's 400-Series Highways) and is responsible for law enforcement on many of the waterways in the province. The OPP also works with other provincial agencies, including the Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Natural Resources to enforce highway safety and conservation regulations, respectively. Finally, OPP officers provide security at the Ontario Legislature at Queen's Park in Toronto. The OPP is one of three provincial police forces in Canada. The others are the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland and Labrador and the Sûreté du Québec in Quebec. History. At the First Parliament of Upper Canada on September 17, 1792, at Niagara-on-the-Lake, provision was made for the formation of a 'police system'. Initially, policing jurisdictions were limited to districts, townships, and parishes. In 1871, four years after Confederation, the Constables' Act extended jurisdiction and gave designated police members authorization to act throughout the province. The first salaried Provincial Constable appointed to act as Detective for the Government of Ontario was John Wilson Murray (1840–1906), hired in 1875. Murray was joined by two additional detectives in 1897, marking the beginnings of the Criminal Investigation Branch. However, for the most part, policing outside of Ontario's cities was non-existent. With the discovery of silver in Cobalt and gold in Timmins, lawlessness was increasingly becoming a problem in northern Ontario. Police constables were gradually introduced in various areas, until an Order in Council decreed the establishment of a permanent organization of salaried constables designated as The Ontario Provincial Police on October 13, 1909. It consisted of 45 men under the direction of Superintendent Joseph E. Rogers. The starting salary for constables was $400.00 per annum, increased to $900.00 in 1912. The first O.P.P. detachment was located in Bala, Ontario. In 1921, restructuring was undertaken with the passing of the Provincial Police Force Act. The title of the commanding officer was changed to Commissioner and given responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the Ontario Temperance Act and other liquor regulations. Major-General Harry Macintyre Cawthra-Elliot was appointed as the first Commissioner. Christopher D. Lewis is the current Commissioner, replacing Julian Fantino, who retired July 31, 2010. Fantino took office in October 2006, succeeding Gwen M. Boniface. The O.P.P.'s first line of duty death occurred in 1923 when escaped convict Leo Rogers shot and killed Sergeant John Urquhart near North Bay. Rogers, who was later killed in a shootout with O.P.P. officers, had already mortally wounded North Bay City Constable Fred Lefebvre. The first O.P.P. motorcycle patrol was introduced in 1928, phased out in 1942 and then reintroduced in 1949. The first marked O.P.P. patrol car was introduced in 1941. During World War II, the Veterans Guard was formed. This was a body of volunteers (primarily World War I veterans), under the supervision of regular police members, protected vulnerable hydroelectric plants and the Welland Ship Canal. Volunteers continue to serve with the O.P.P. Auxiliary, which was originally formed in 1960 by an Order in Council when the program absorbed the Emergency Measures Organization who were trained in crowd control and first aid. It is recognized that O.P.P. auxiliary constables shall not be utilized to replace regular members in any duties. The Ontario Police Services Act does, however, provide for instances when the Auxiliary Member may have the authority of a Police Officer. This can occur in an emergency situation where the O.P.P. requires additional strength to cope with a special occasion or event. Women joined the uniform ranks in 1974. In 1985, the O.P.P. uniform was made more distinctive with the introduction of a blue trouser stripe to match a blue peak cap band. In 1995, General Headquarters moved into its new facility in Orillia and for the first time in the history of the organization, all Bureaus were in one building. During the 1990s, officer uniforms changed with darker shirts and matching body armour vests were introduced. In the early years the OPP wore olive green coloured uniforms. From 1909 to 1930s, the OPP used stetson as the official headgear and from 1997 to 2008. From 1930s to 1997 the peaked cap was worn and has been returned to service after 2008. During 1997 to 2008, the peaked cap was still worn by commanding officers of the force. Organization and operations. The Ontario Provincial Police is responsible for providing policing services over one million square kilometres of land and 174 000 km2 of water to a population of 2.3 million people (3.6 million in the summer months). Currently, the O.P.P. has over 6,100 uniformed, 850 auxiliary and 2,700 civilian personnel(2010). The vehicle fleet consists of 2,290 vehicles, 114 marine vessels, 286 snow and all-terrain vehicles, 2 helicopters and 2 fixed-wing aircraft. The province is divided into six operational regions: Field and operational services are provided from 163 police stations and satellite locations throughout Ontario. OPP stations are called ""detachments."" The OPP General Headquarters are located in Orillia. Until 1995, the administration and headquarters divisions operated out of a number of buildings in Toronto. From 1973 to 1995 the headquarters were based out of the old Workmen's Compensation Board Building at 90 Harbour Street (now being demolished). Operations were moved to Orillia as part of a government move to decentralize ministries and operations to other parts of Ontario. In 1922, the OPP headquarters was on the second floor of the Legislature at Queen's Park in Toronto. Legislative Security Service. The Legislative Security Service consists of OPP officers who provide security services to the Legislative Precinct (Legislature Building and Whitney Block) and report to the Sergeant-at-Arms. Training. All recruits attend the Ontario Police College in Aylmer, Ontario and complete their training at OPP facilities in Orillia. Historically, new recruits were trained in a variety of facilities in and around Toronto until the OPP Training and Development Centre was opened in Brampton in 1981. It remained in operation until 1998, when training moved to the Orillia headquarters. Rank. Rank Structure within the OPP is paramilitary or quasi-military in nature, with several 'non-commissioned' ranks leading to the 'officer' ranks. Contrary to popular belief, the Detective ranks fall laterally with the uniform ranks and is not a promotion above. Auxiliary Program. The OPP has among its many initiatives an auxiliary program. The Ontario Provincial Police Auxiliary program follows a mission statement: “To provide fully trained volunteer Auxiliary Members to perform police duties in special circumstances, including emergencies, when there are not sufficient OPP police officers.” The OPP auxiliary is a volunteer program where selected citizens receive special training in order to perform many duties such as community policing initiatives and projects, regular patrol, crime and disaster scenes, large gatherings or parades for crowd and traffic control, and traffic control at accidents. The Ontario Provincial Police auxiliary program is the only such Canadian program that requires its auxiliary constables to attend a full-time recruit course conducted near its regular training facility in Orillia. This is followed by ongoing in-service training at the detachments. The program may also serve as a stepping stone for potential future employment. The OPP Auxiliary has an authorised strength of over 900 auxiliary constables and is the largest police auxiliary unit in Ontario. Fleet. Ground. In 2007, the OPP announced that it would return to a black-and-white colour scheme for its police cruisers.[http://www.opp.ca/images/OPP_2007_Black&White_print.jpg] Historically, the force had used black-and-white vehicles from the introduction of the first marked police cars in 1941 to 1989 when all-white cars with blue and gold striping were introduced. The change was implemented starting in March 2007 and should have been complete in 2009. Cars will not be repainted, but new vehicles purchased will use the original colour scheme. The OPP has approximately 1,200 patrol cars in service throughout the province. Common models include the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and Chevrolet Tahoe. Various vans and SUVs are used as support vehicles including 52 prisoner transport vehicles that are specially designed to transport up to 24 prisoners at a time. Harley Davidson FL motorcycles are used for traffic patrol in the summer months and at least 1 manual transmission Dodge Srt Viper is used for Highway Patrol.[http://www.engsoc.org/~pat/log/index.cgi/2007/10/index.html]  The implementation of the SAVE units has brought ATVs into the forefront of proactive policing of recreational activities. The OPP has 2 Cambli International Thunder 1 armoured rescue vehicles since 2012 for shared by 3 Tactics and Rescue Units in the province. OPP in pop culture. The Beatles folklore. The Beatles's 1967 album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" contains cover art with Paul McCartney wearing an OPP patch on his fictional uniform (more easily seen in the gatefold picture). The patch was given to John Lennon the day after their 1966 concert in Toronto by a summer student working in the garage of the OPP Headquarters. The group was being transferred to a police van for the trip to the airport. Many ""Paul Is Dead"" enthusiasts have misread the patch as ""OPD"" (the way the patch was slightly bent on McCartney's sleeve in the gatefold picture, the bottom of the ""P"" was not visible) and took it to mean ""Officially Pronounced Dead"". Habbo Hotel. On the online social networking website Habbo Hotel Canada, O.P.P. officers and spokespersons visit the online application to talk to teens on board the web site's ""Infobus"". During the weekly sessions, users of the Habbo service are able to ask the officers and spokespersons questions, primarily regarding online safety. During the Infobus sessions, the O.P.P. officer talks to the users within the bus about cyberbullying and online safety. The O.P.P. officer holding the session users staff specific tools to ask questions to the whole bus so a more direct answer can be given. This is by using the quiz tool in which users must vote on a multiple choice question which appears in an in-game pop-up. The O.P.P. officers' Habbo account is also given moderation powers to control the bus behavior. The O.P.P. officer ingame account is given the CAA badge. (CAA relates to the badge code used when uploading into the badge directory for the Hotels. The ""CA"" section of the badge relates to the Hotel and the ""A"" relates to it being the tenth badge to have been uploaded with the ""CA"" prefix.) This allows users to recognize them whilst in the game and it is this badge that gives them the housekeeping powers needed to run the Quiz Tool. Other instances. In the Canadian horror film ""Pontypool"", the O.P.P. is called into the eponymous town to control a zombie outbreak, ultimately resulting in a massacre. The response of the government to this outbreak draws many parallels to Canadian separatist movements. The film's lead character, Grant Mazzy, vocally denounces the O.P.P.'s actions on the radio. Kim Mitchell regularly wore an O.P.P. hat as part of his visual trademark in the 80s and early 90s, mostly to cover up his male-pattern baldness. He has long since adopted the practice of shaving his head, thus eliminating the need for the hat. In the 1992 ""Degrassi"" film, ""School's Out"", OPP cars are shown at the scene of a car accident involving Derek ""Wheels"" Wheeler and Lucy Fernandez. Controversy. $90,000,000.00 lawsuit for corruption and extortion. In February 2011, Gerald Guy Brummell filed a $90 million dollar lawsuit against 36 OPP officers, claiming corruption, conspiracy, coverup, extortion and theft. Brummell's claim that OPP continually refused to bring officers to justice was filed as action 11/11 in The Superior Court of Justice in Cobourg, Ontario. In his action, Brummell claims not only was there an engaged criminal conspiracy to harm he and his family by OPP detectives named, but that the evidence against the officers was their own photographs and notes. He further claims that the OPP used the Professional Standards Bureau, the Anti Rackets Bureau and unnamed members of the Crown Criminal Division to coverup government crimes and obstruct justice. Following the sentencing of serial killer Russell Williams, OPP Detective Andrew Ben Beatty a key officer named in the Brummell action, was also named in two further lawsuits by ""Williams victims"" Laurie Massicotte (Holographically) for $7.5 million and Larry Jones for $1.5 million. In the case of Larry Jones, Andrew Beatty and OPP Detective Sergeant Darryl Foulkes executed a warrant upon Jones home, directly next door to serial killer Williams. "
wikipedia-375500," Sûreté du Québec  Sûreté du Québec or SQ (English: literally Quebec Safety, more commonly Quebec Provincial Police or QPP as no official English name exists) is the provincial police force for the Canadian province of Quebec. The headquarters of the Sûreté du Québec are located on Parthenais street in Montreal and the force employs roughly 5,200 officers. The primary function of the Sûreté du Québec is to enforce provincial laws, some municipal bylaws, the criminal code, and many other laws throughout Quebec and to assist municipal police forces when needed. Members of the force can also legally act as forest conservation agents for example. The Sûreté du Québec is also responsible for providing municipal police services to municipalities in the province that do not otherwise have municipal or regional police services. Currently that includes municipalities with under 50,000 people. As such, the force is mainly present in small rural and suburban areas. The force also patrols provincial highways. In addition, the Sûreté du Québec can investigate any incident that involves wrongdoing by a municipal police force or a case where a police intervention caused death. In the early 2000s, the force absorbed many smaller police services (e.g., Drummondville and Saint-Hyacinthe). History. On February 1, 1870, the Quebec provincial government created the ""Police provinciale du Québec"" under the direction of its first commissioner, Judge Pierre-Antoine Doucet. This new force took over the headquarters of the Quebec City municipal police, which were then disbanded, although the city relaunched a municipal force in 1877. In 1900, two distinct provincial police forces were created: the Office of Provincial Detectives of Montreal, in response to a crime wave in that city, and the Revenue Police, whose mission was to collect taxes. In 1902, the government decided that the provincial police should no longer be directed by a judge but by an officer of the police themselves. Augustin McCarthy was chosen as the first chief drawn from the ranks of the police. In 1922, two headquarters were established, one in Quebec City, headed by McCarthy, and one in Montreal, headed by Dieudonné Daniel Lorrain. The Office of Provincial Detectives of Montreal became part of the general provincial police in that year. The Quebec division included 35 police officers and 2 detectives. In 1925, police officers started patrolling on motorcycles. Montebello Incident. The Sûreté du Québec admitted in August 2007 that they had used undercover police posing as protestors at the 2007 Montebello SPP meetings. This admission was made after a video captured by protestors was widely circulated in the Canadian media and made available on YouTube. Although use of undercover agents at protests of this kind is widespread, the video was especially controversial because it appeared to show one of the officers carrying a rock, suggesting to some the police may have been acting as agents provocateurs by inciting violence. LPRS: License Plate Recognition System. The Sûreté du Québec has been using the LPRS systems since 2009. The objective of the LPRS is to make the streets and highways more safe by removing vehicles not authorized to be on the road. The hotlist plate database can consist of the following types: The LPRS are currently installed on 10 Sûreté du Québec vehicles. The LPRS integrator is Gtechna. Gtechna is primarily a citations issuance and management software developer which integrates mission critical technologies such as License Plate Recognition (LPR) to streamline the enforcement of moving and parking violations. Rank badges. Rank insignia of the Sûreté du Québec are on contained on ""slip on"" sleeves worn on the epaulettes of uniform jacket or shirt shoulders. The rank insignia: Fleet. Cars: Trucks: Motorcycles: Special Vehicles: Air: Sea: Wild: Miscellaneous: Equipment. The standard-issue weapon of Sûreté du Québec is the Glock pistol loaded in 9x19mm Parabellum caliber. Various models are adopted such as the standard Glock 17、compact Glock 19 and sub-compact Glock 26. "
wikipedia-375502," George Lazenby  George Robert Lazenby (born 5 September 1939) is an Australian actor and former model, best known for portraying James Bond in the 1969 film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Early life. Lazenby was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, at Ovada Private Hospital, to railway worker George Edward Lazenby and Sheila Joan Lazenby (née Bodel), who worked at Fosseys. He went to Bourke Street School in his primary years, and Goulburn High until either 1953 or 1954. His sister, Barbara, was an accomplished dancer. When he was young he spent 18 months in hospital after having an operation which left him with only half a kidney. When Lazenby was about 13 he moved with his family from Goulburn to Queanbeyan, where his father ran a store. He worked as a car salesman and mechanic, before serving in the Australian Army. He moved to London in 1963. Career. Lazenby became a used car salesman in Finchley, then sold new cars in Park Lane. He was spotted by a talent scout who persuaded him to become a model, and he was soon earning ₤25,000 a year. He was best known for an advertisement for Big Fry Chocolate. James Bond (1969). In 1968, after Sean Connery quit the role of James Bond, producer Albert R. Broccoli first met Lazenby when getting their hair cut at the same barber. He later saw him in the Big Fry commercial and felt he could be a possible Bond, calling him in for a screen test. Lazenby dressed for the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery). Broccoli offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene, the strength of his interviews, fight skills and audition footage. Director Peter R. Hunt later claimed: We wanted someone who oozed sexual assurance, and we think this fellow has that. Just wait til the women see him on screen ... I am not saying he is an actor. There is a great deal of difference between an actor and a film star. Didn't they find Gary Cooper when he was an electrician? During the production of the film, Lazenby's voice was dubbed over with George Baker's in scenes in which Bond impersonated Sir Hilary Bray (Baker's character), something not traditionally done with a leading actor whose original language is English. According to an interview, Lazenby experienced difficulties on the set stemming from director Hunt's refusal to speak directly with him, and Hunt's brusqueness in asking Lazenby's friends to clear the set before filming. Leaving Bond. In November 1969, prior to the release of the film, Lazenby announced that he no longer wished to play the role of James Bond due to his conflict with the film's producers, about whom he said, ""They made me feel like I was mindless. They disregarded everything I suggested simply because I hadn't been in the film business like them for about a thousand years."" His co-star Diana Rigg was among many who commented on this decision: The role made Sean Connery a millionaire. It made Sean Connery ... I truly don't know what's happening in George's mind so I can only speak of my reaction. I think it's a pretty foolish move. I think if he can bear to do an apprenticeship, which everybody in this business has to do - ""has"" to do - then he should do it quietly and with humility. Everybody has to do it. There are few instant successes in the film business. And the instant successes one usually associates with somebody who is willing to learn anyway. Lazenby grew a beard and long hair. ""Bond is a brute,"" he announced. ""I've already put him behind me. I will never play him again. Peace - that's the message now."" He later elaborated: Fantasy doesn't interest me. Reality does. Anyone who's in touch with the kids knows what's happening, knows the mood. Watch pop music and learn what's going to happen. Most filmmakers don't watch and aren't in touch. People aren't going to films because filmmakers are putting out films people don't want to see. As for the so-called ""Tomorrow movies"" they are only tomorrow movies with yesterday directors ... Actors aren't all that important. Directors are. I'm terribly impressed with Dennis Hopper. I'd like to work for him. I also like Arthur Penn, John Schlesinger and Peter Yates ... What I'm going to do is look for a great director first, a good screenplay second. Meanwhile, no more Bond. I make better money doing commercials. At the time of the release of ""OHMSS"", Lazenby's performance received mixed reviews. Some felt that, while he was physically convincing, some of his costumes were inappropriate (""too loud"" according to some) and that he delivered his lines poorly. Others, however, have developed differing views in the decades since the film. In the 1998 book ""The Essential James Bond"", Lee Pfeiffer and Dave Worrell write: ""Although ""OHMSS"" was routinely dismissed by critics who cited Lazenby as a brave but disappointing successor to Connery, the intervening years have been notably kinder to both the film and its star. Indeed, due in no small part to Peter Hunt's inspired direction, ""OHMSS"" generally ranks among the top films with fans. Likewise, Lazenby has emerged as a very popular contributor to the series and has enjoyed large enthusiastic audiences during his appearances at Bond related events. In summary, ""OHMSS"" is a brilliant thriller in its own right and justifiably ranks amongst the best Bond films ever made"". In Roger Moore's commentary for a 2007 DVD release of ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", he referenced George Lazenby as follows : ""I have a great deal of e-mail contact with George Lazenby; he's sort of on the joke circuit ... that we simply send jokes to each other. ""OHMSS"" – very well made film – Peter Hunt – excellent, excellent, excellent fight stuff, excellent snow effects ... but I think the end result for George was that it was one of the better Bonds"". Although Lazenby had been offered a contract for seven movies, his agent, Ronan O'Rahilly, convinced him that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, and as a result he left the series after the release of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" in 1969. After this role Lazenby began to study drama at Durham University's College of the Venerable Bede. Lazenby has portrayed James Bond several times over the years in numerous parodies and unofficial 007 roles, most notably the 1983 television movie ""The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and an episode of ""The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", entitled ""Diamonds Aren't Forever"". In 2012 Lazenby made a guest appearance on the Canadian sketch comedy series ""This Hour Has 22 Minutes"", spoofing the 007 series in a skit called ""Help, I've Skyfallen and I Can't Get Up"". Although Eon Productions attempted on several occasions to cast Americans as Bond (most notably signing John Gavin for ""Diamonds Are Forever"" before the services of Sean Connery were obtained) Lazenby remains the only actor from outside the British Isles to portray Bond in a Bond feature film. Post-Bond career. Lazenby's first film after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was ""Universal Soldier"" (1971), which he helped write. He also appeared in an Italian film, then spent the next 15 months sailing around the world. He then played a role in the BBC's ""Play For Today"" series in 1973, with Lazenby starring in Roger Smith's ""The Operation"". Broccoli claims that Lazenby asked for another chance to play James Bond in 1971 but the producer refused. In 1973, Lazenby was set to work in Hong Kong with Bruce Lee. A planned meeting with Lee and Raymond Chow to discuss a movie project for the Golden Harvest film ""Game of Death"" collapsed after Lee's sudden death, although Lazenby would still go on to make three of the four films he signed to do with Lee in Hong Kong, ""The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss"" (1974), ""The Man from Hong Kong"" (1975) (also known as ""The Dragon Flies""), and ""A Queen's Ransom"" (1976). Lazenby was only featured with archive footage when ""Game of Death"" was finally released in 1978, after a five-year delay caused by Lee's death while it was still in production. In the mid-1970s, he appeared in a number of television movies shot in Australia, then he returned to Hollywood. In 1978, he took out an advertisement in ""Variety"", offering himself for acting work. ""If I could get a TV series or a good movie, I swear I'd do it for nothing,"" he told a journalist. Lazenby had a brief appearance in the 1983 made for television movie ""The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E"", which his on screen character was identified only by the initials ""J.B."". Lazenby later spoofed his spy image in the 1996 video game ""Fox Hunt"", the full-motion video aspects of which were later reedited as a limited-release feature film. Lazenby also made a guest appearance on the television series ""Superboy"", playing as an alien disguised as Jor-El, Superboy's biological father, in a two-part episode story during the series' 1990 second season. He appeared with Sylvia Kristel in several new ""Emmanuelle"" films in the 1990s, many of which appeared on cable television. In the films, Lazenby plays a businessman who listens to Kristel's character recounting her sexual history; neither Lazenby nor Kristel participated in any of the films' frequent sexual scenes. Influence on popular culture. Lazenby's singular portrayal of the iconic Bond character, and his lack of standing as a favourite in the series has resulted in his name being used as a metaphor for forgettable, non-iconic acting efforts in other entertainment franchises, and for entities that are largely ignored. In his review of ""Batman & Robin"", widely regarded as the weakest and least successful film in the ""Batman"" film franchise, Mick LaSalle of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" said that George Clooney ""should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series."" Actor Paul McGann has described himself with good humour as ""the George Lazenby of ""Doctor Who"""" because, although he has continued in the role of the Eighth Doctor in other media, he made only one appearance on TV as the Time Lord. In a September 2006 episode of ""The Daily Show"", comedian John Oliver suggested that Pope Benedict XVI is the George Lazenby of the papacy, in comparison to ""John Paul II's Sean Connery"". In 2010 Roger Moore, who also played James Bond, provided the voice of a talking cat character named Tab Lazenby in the film """", which contained . Personal life. In 1973, Lazenby married his girlfriend of three years, Chrissie Townsend . They subsequently divorced. Lazenby later married former tennis player Pam Shriver. In August 2008, it was reported that Shriver had filed for divorce from Lazenby. Documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court cite ""irreconcilable differences"" for the end of the couple's six-year marriage. The couple have three children, including twins born in 2005. Lazenby's autobiography, ""The Other Fella"", is scheduled to be released in hardcover by Century in 2013, and in paperback by Arrow in 2013. "
wikipedia-375503," Frieze group  A frieze group is a mathematical concept to classify designs on two-dimensional surfaces which are repetitive in one direction, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. The mathematical study of such patterns reveals that exactly 7 different types of patterns can occur. Frieze groups are two-dimensional line groups, from having only one direction of repeat, and they are related to the more complex wallpaper groups, which classify patterns that are repetitive in two directions. As with wallpaper groups, a frieze group is often visualised by a simple periodic pattern in the category concerned. General. Formally, a frieze group is a class of infinite discrete symmetry groups for patterns on a strip (infinitely wide rectangle), hence a class of groups of isometries of the plane, or of a strip. There are seven different frieze groups. The actual symmetry groups within a frieze group are characterized by the smallest translation distance, and, for the frieze groups 4-7, by a shifting parameter. In the case of symmetry groups in the plane, additional parameters are the direction of the translation vector, and, for the frieze groups 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, the positioning perpendicular to the translation vector. Thus there are two degrees of freedom for group 1, three for groups 2, 3, and 4, and four for groups 5, 6, and 7. Many authors present the frieze groups in a different order. A symmetry group of a frieze group necessarily contains translations and may contain glide reflections. Other possible group elements are reflections along the long axis of the strip, reflections along the narrow axis of the strip and 180° rotations. For two of the seven frieze groups (numbers 1 and 2 below) the symmetry groups are singly generated, for four (numbers 3–6) they have a pair of generators, and for number 7 the symmetry groups require three generators. A symmetry group in frieze group 1, 3, 4, or 5 is a subgroup of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with the same translational distance. A symmetry group in frieze group 2 or 6 is a subgroup of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with ""half"" the translational distance. This last frieze group contains the symmetry groups of the simplest periodic patterns in the strip (or the plane), a row of dots. Any transformation of the plane leaving this pattern invariant can be decomposed into a translation, (""x"",""y"") → (""n""+""x"",""y""), optionally followed by a reflection in either the horizontal axis, (""x"",""y"") → (""x"",−""y""), or the vertical axis, (""x"",""y"") → (−""x"",""y""), provided that this axis is chosen through or midway between two dots, or a rotation by 180°, (""x"",""y"") → (−""x"",−""y"") (ditto). Therefore, in a way, this frieze group contains the ""largest"" symmetry groups, which consist of all such transformations. The inclusion of the ""discrete"" condition is to exclude the group containing all translations, and groups containing arbitrarily small translations (e.g. the group of horizontal translations by rational distances). Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number. The inclusion of the ""infinite"" condition is to exclude groups that have no translations: Descriptions of the seven frieze groups. There are seven distinct subgroups (up to scaling and shifting of patterns) in the discrete frieze group generated by a translation, reflection (along the same axis) and a 180° rotation. Each of these subgroups is the symmetry group of a frieze pattern, and sample patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The seven different groups correspond to the 7 infinite series of axial point groups in three dimensions, with ""n"" = ∞. They are identified using Hermann-Mauguin notation or IUC notation, orbifold notation, Coxeter notation, and Schönflies notation: Summarized: As we have seen, up to isomorphism, there are four groups, two abelian, and two non-abelian. The groups can be classified by their type of two-dimensional grid or lattice: The lattice being oblique means that the second direction need not be orthogonal to the direction of repeat. The groups' order in this table is their order in the International Tables for Crystallography, which differs from orders given elsewhere. Web demo and software. There exist software graphic tools that will let you create 2D patterns using frieze groups. Usually, you can edit the original strip and its copies in the entire pattern are updated automatically. "
wikipedia-375506," Coin grading  In coin collecting coin grading is the process of determining the grade or condition of a coin, one of the key factors in determining its value as a collector's item. The grading of a coin includes the analysis of several criteria, the most important being the quality, the rarity, the interest factor, and the liquidity factor. Overview. Coin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer and finer grade distinctions. Originally, there were only two grades, new and used. This evolved for a time to the letter grading system beginning with the lowest grade – ""Basal State"" (also ""Poor"" (PO)), then continuing ""Fair"" (Fr), ""About"" or ""Almost Good"" (AG), ""Good"" (G), ""Very Good"" (VG), ""Fine"" (F), ""Very Fine"" (VF), ""Extra Fine"" (EF or XF), ""Almost"" or ""About Uncirculated"" (AU), ""Uncirculated"" (Unc) and up to ""Brilliant Uncirculated"" (BU). ""Gem Uncirculated"" was roughly equivalent in usage to BU at that time. The British grading system is similar, except that 'Good' and 'Very Good' are 'Poor' and 'Fair' respectively. The word 'Good' used to describe a coin under the British grading system is usually an indication that it is at the higher end of its grading classification, e.g. a 'Good Fine' coin will be in a better condition than a coin that is merely 'Fine'. William H. Sheldon in his book ""Penny Whimsy"" is credited with coming up with the Sheldon Scale in the 1950s, a numeric system going from 1-70. It was intended to be a reflection of the relative value of a 1794 Large Cent, which was then worth $1 in Basal State and $70 in Uncirculated MS-70. This numerical system was used primarily within the community of large copper coin collectors (a very specialized part of numismatics that often has its own ideas about quality and grading compared to the rest of the coin collecting community) until the mid-1980s. Now it is widely known that the numbers are a scale: 70 being a perfect coin, and 1 appearing as little more than a piece of heavily worn oxidized, scarred, and bent metal. Components. A ""grade"" is a shorthand devised by numismatists to indicate the appearance of a coin. There are generally five main components which determine a coin's grade: strike, surface preservation, luster, coloration and eye appeal. Quality grading. Early grading systems. The quality of all coins is not equal and collectors felt the necessity of defining the quality of the coins in order to assess their value. Rims, nicks, polishing, scratches and other forms of wear are considered factors in grading a coin. Also, if coins have been in some form of jewelry also affects the grading. In the early years of coin collecting, three general terms were used to grade coins: Sheldon grading system. As the collector market for coins grew rapidly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, it became apparent that a more precise grading standard was needed. Some coins were simply more fine than others, and some uncirculated coins showed more luster and far fewer marks than others. Terms like ""gem uncirculated"" and ""very fine"" began to see use, as more precise grading descriptions allowed for more precise pricing for the booming collector market. In 1948, a well-known numismatist by the name of Dr. William Herbert Sheldon attempted to standardize coin grading by proposing what is now known as the Sheldon Scale. Sheldon's scale, included in his famous work ""Penny Whimsy"", was originally devised specifically for United States large cents, but it is now applied to all series. The scale runs from 0 to 70, where 0 means that you can pretty much tell that it was once a coin while 70 means that it is perfect. European grading system. European countries use various, roughly equivalent, grading systems. The main features of their systems are presented in the following table: Distinctions. In 1984, Numismatic Certification Institute (NCI), the first privately owned grading service, was launched by the owners of Heritage Rare Coin Galleries (now Heritage Auction Galleries) of Dallas, Texas. In 1985, Ivy Press published the NCI Grading Guide, later renamed How to Grade U.S. Coins, an instruction manual on grading mint state and proof U.S. coins by James L. Halperin.  In 1986, PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) was incorporated. PCGS authenticated, graded and encapsulated coins in a protective hard plastic shell. They used a combination of the two older systems putting letters and numbers together so that the grades became BS-1 (or PO-1), FR-2, AG-3, G-4 (Good: coin is heavily worn, even the major detail is not clearly visible), G-6, VG-8, VG-10, F-12 (Fine: fine detail visible but coin is heavily worn), F-15, VF-20, VF-25, VF-30, VF-35, XF-40, XF-45, AU-50 (About Un-circulated), AU-53, AU-55, AU-58, MS-60 (Mint State: completely un-circulated condition), MS-61, MS-62, MS-63, MS-64, MS-65, MS-66, MS-67, MS-68, MS-69 and MS-70 (Mint State: perfect, the highest level on the Sheldon Scale). For mint state and proof coins, PCGS used a slightly stricter interpretation than NCI, but basically employed the same standards outlined in Halperin's book. They also issued limited guarantees for the value of coins they had graded. The march to finer and finer distinction had taken another huge step. Alongside this scale was a similar one for proof coins PR-01 or PF-01 through PR-70 or PF-70 that was roughly equivalent to the MS scale, except for proof coins. This is important as in some issues distinguishing between mint state (for commerce) and proof coins is very difficult and specialized and the price differences can be large in favor of either MS or PR/PF. The origin of the idea to make coins easily tradable on an open market came from Wall Street in order to expand beyond the bullion coin market. However, because they had finite mintages, and used ""technical grading"" rather than ""market grading"" there are physical and practical limits to their system, particularly in relating the grade directly to a value. One thing PCGS did accomplish was largely ridding the marketplace of inferior counterfeit coins. Unfortunately, some better counterfeits have since come into being, further justifying the need for professional authentication in a counterfeit-authentication arms race. Rarity factor. The value of coins depends on their rarity. There are several scales which have been developed for the definition of the rarity of a particular coin. The most common are the ""Sheldon rarity scale"" and the ""Universal rarity scale""  Sheldon rarity scale. The Sheldon scale has been developed by William Herbert Sheldon in 1958 and consists of a progression of eight levels, in which the population of all coin varieties are to fall. Each level is prefaced with the letter ""R"", indicating rarity. While being developed for the one cent coins which he studied, the scale has been used for defining the rarity of all coins. Universal rarity scale. The Universal rarity scale (URS) was developed in 1992 by Q. David Bowers. Scholten scale. Dutch numismatist C. Scholten developed the following rarity scale in 1953 which he applied to the study of coins in the Dutch colonies The Scholten scale includes the following degrees of rarity Interest factor. The Interest factor is a term used to indicate how much demand a particular coin or variety might have. A variety with a very high interest factor would be in high demand, with several thousands of collectors desiring the variety. A medium interest factor may indicate that the variety is desired by hundreds or a few thousand people, and a low interest factor might indicate that the coin is sought by just a handful of collectors. As a variety receives more publicity within the numismatic press, the interest factor may rise as demand increases. This may cause the price or value of certain varieties to increase without any change in the estimated quantity available. On the other hand, if a large quantity of a variety surfaces, the value of that variety may decrease as the supply outstrips the demand. As in other segments of the hobby, a combination of supply and demand almost always dictates the price or value of a particular variety. Liquidity factor. The Liquidity factor is a measurement developed by J. T. Stanton, president of PCI Grading Company to indicate how quickly or how easily a coin or variety should sell at auction, given normal market conditions. Using a scale of 1 to 5, a Liquidity factor of 1 would indicate that the coin would not normally sell very easily or fast, and usually at a discount from suggested values. A Liquidity factor of 5 would be expected to sell right away, and generally command full or inflated suggested values. Hot or highly active market conditions would usually inflate the Liquidity of any coin, with a cold market causing the opposite. Grading services. As of 2013, there are two prevalent coin grading services in the United States: Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) and Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC). ANACS is considered the third leading service, and is also quite credible. ICG is the fourth largest. In Canada you have International Coin Certification Service (ICCS), established in 1986, and Canadian Coin Certification Service (CCCS).  There are subtle variations in the grades assigned by each of these major services due to the grading philosophy used, and prospective buyers are encouraged to seek professional or expert advice before making any important rare coin purchases. An interesting contender among previous grading services was Compugrade. In 1990 Henry Merton was awarded United States Patent Number 4,899,392: Method and System for Objectively Grading and Identifying Coins, Feb. 6, 1990. Compugrade’s computers evaluated mint luster, physical damage to the coin and other conditions that detracted from the quality of 'Mint State.' Compugrade also patented a ‘tamper-proof’ slab to hold the coins that they graded. However, a ‘coup’ by members of Compugrade’s board of directors caused Henry Merton to telephone the Editor of Coin World to ask her to publish the letter that he had filed with her. That letter acknowledged assistance from numismatists who had not signed release forms for their contribution of information to the writing of the patent. That letter to the editor ‘wiped out’ Compugrade’s exclusivity by placing the patent in the public domain, which was Merton’s intent. In the May 26, 2003, edition of Coin World, the hobby newspaper had announced they had contracted investigators to conduct a year-long, comparative study of PCGS, ANACS, NGC, and ICG, along with several other grading services, each known as a TPG or Third Party Grading. In their investigation, Coin World sent several of the same coins to each grading service over the course of a year, each coin being graded by all Third Party Grading services. The findings were; ""In no case did the grading services agree on the grade of any given coin, and in some cases the difference in grading was as much as seven points off"". By way of example, a finding published by Coin World involved one case where ACCGS had graded a coin as ""cleaned"", which may lower the coin value. Additionally the coin had been graded several grades lower than PCGS while PCGS had not noted the same coin was ""in fact, cleaned"". It is standard in U.S. and Canadian numismatics to grade coins on a point-scale from 1 (poor) to 70 (perfect), and to note if a coin has been cleaned or poorly mishandled, or in some cases to reject it for encapsulation. On January 5, 2007, the Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG) published a more recent report about grading services and standards. The survey indicated the professional opinions of numismatists who buy and sell coins. No grading service was listed as ""outstanding"". PCGS and NGC were ranked as ""superior"". ANACS and ICG were ranked as ""good"". In September 2004, members of the American Numismatic Association (ANA) reported seeing counterfeit NGC PCGS holders (also known as ""slabs"") at the Long Beach Coin Show. Members of the Beverly Hills Coin Club (BHCC) an affiliate club-member of the ANA, had reported counterfeit coin slabs as early as December 3, 1998. As a direct result, BHCC partnered with ACCGS, manned by unpaid club volunteers, as a pre-certification service for coins and to ""guarantee the authenticity of slabs or Third Party Grader holders"". More counterfeit PCGS and NGC holders were reported on eBay in 2005 and later years, but NGC did not address the problem until 2008, after high-quality counterfeit holders had been seen and purchased on eBay. Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) published the following acknowledgment on January 7, 2008: ""NGC has identified and confirmed that (counterfeit) of its holder had been produced...The holder has been seen housing counterfeit dollar or foreign crown size coins. While the enclosed coins are also counterfeit, the label information matches the coin type enclosed. The label information is copied from actual NGC certification labels, and the certification information therefore will match the NGC database. Most frequently, Trade Dollars and Bust Dollars are found, although Flowing Hair Dollars and foreign coins have also been seen. A range of grades is also represented."" There is another group of coins called ""Replicas"". These are not legitimate items but copies and are stamped as such and not classed as counterfeit. NGC and PCGS counterfeit holders have been reported in eBay forums and more may be reported by other firms and individuals. The PCGS website notes that they ""anticipate that authentic coins will eventually be placed into counterfeit holders"". Third party graders have taken measures to enhance their security devices. Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and PCGS offer no reimbursement liability for the prices paid for coins in counterfeit holders. Both firms in the U.S and CCCS in Canada have online links to verify the holder numbers, ICCS provides a phone number. However, many buyers may not be computer users or may be unaware of such links. Caution is advised when purchasing coins in PCGS and Numismatic Guaranty Corporation holders as the seller can disclaim liability due to the ""third party"" nature of the counterfeit holder. Additionally, it may be too late to request refunds from eBay sellers before holders can be verified as counterfeits. Many coins are posted on eBay and through other venues ""as is"" and therefore with no return privileges. Again these counterfeits do represent a very small percentage of the overall coins graded. Complexity. Series-specific strike distinctions such as FSB (Fully Split Bands) for Mercury and Roosevelt Dimes, FBL (Full Bell Lines) for Franklin Half Dollars, FH (Full Head) for Standing Liberty Quarters, 5 and 6 step Jefferson Nickels and so forth are creating ""condition rarities"" out of coins formerly thought of as common. In addition, both PCGS and NGC introduced ""Plus"" grading in 2010, whereby coins graded between XF45 and MS68 can receive a '+' (for example, MS63+) if they are at the high end of their assigned grade. The depth of mirrors on proof coinage has led to terms of distinction such as Cameo, Deep Cameo, Ultra Cameo and so forth. Also, uncirculated coins are sometimes deemed Proof-like and Deep Mirror Proof-like. "
wikipedia-375518," Austin-Healey  Austin-Healey was a British sports car maker. The marque was established through a joint-venture arrangement, set up in 1952 between Leonard Lord of the Austin division of the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and the Donald Healey Motor Company, a renowned automotive engineering and design firm. Austin-Healey cars were produced until 1972 when the 20-year agreement between Healey and Austin came to an end. Donald Healey left the company in 1968 when British Motor Holdings (BMC had merged with Jaguar Cars in 1966 to form BMH) was merged into British Leyland. Healey joined Jensen Motors who had been making bodies for the ""big Healeys"" since their inception in 1952, and became their chairman in 1972. Racing. The Austin Healey was extensively raced by the Donald Healey Motor Company in Europe at Le Mans and in Sebring in the U.S., in classic rallies by the BMC competitions department, and was recognized from the very beginning by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Healey models raced in club racing in D, E, and F production classes, winning National Championships in both D and E Production. The last Big Healey to win an SCCA National Championship was the class E Production Austin-Healey 100-6 driven by Alan Barker at the Daytona ARRC in 1965.  In 1953, a special streamlined Austin-Healey set several land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA. Successors. The name ""Austin"" is now owned by Nanjing who bought the assets of MG Rover Group (British Leyland's successor company) out of bankruptcy in 2005. After Donald Healey sold his original business, Donald Healey Motor Company, the Healey brand was registered to a new firm, Healey Automobile Consultants, which the Healey family sold to HFI Automotive in 2005. In June 2007, Nanjing and Healey Automobile Consultants / HFI Automotive signed a collaborative agreement that aims to recreate the Austin Healey and Healey marquees alongside NAC's MG. No timeline has been given as to when the Healey and Austin-Healey brands will return, although MG will be back on the market in China and the UK by the year's end. "
wikipedia-375527," Patch Adams  Hunter Doherty ""Patch"" Adams (born May 28, 1945, in Washington, D.C.) is an American physician, social activist, clown and author. He founded the Gesundheit! Institute in 1971. Each year he organizes a group of volunteers from around the world to travel to various countries where they dress as clowns in an effort to bring humor to orphans, patients, and other people. Adams is currently based in Urbana, Illinois. In collaboration with the institute, he promotes an alternative health care model, not funded by insurance policies. Early life. Adams had a difficult childhood. His father, an officer in the United States Army, had fought in Korea, and died while stationed in Germany when Adams was still a teenager. After his father's death, Adams returned to the United States with his mother and brother. Adams has stated that, upon his return, he encountered institutional injustice which made him a target for bullies at school. As a result, Adams was unhappy and became actively suicidal. After being hospitalized three times in one year for wanting to end his life, he decided ""you don't kill yourself, stupid; you make revolution."" Early career. After graduating (1963) from Wakefield High School, Adams completed pre-med coursework at George Washington University. He began medical school without an undergraduate degree, and earned his Doctor of Medicine degree at Virginia Commonwealth University (Medical College of Virginia) in 1971. In the late 1960s one of his closest friends (a man, not a woman as depicted in the ""Patch Adams"" film) was murdered. Convinced of the powerful connection between environment and wellness, he believes the health of an individual cannot be separated from the health of the family, community, and the world. While working in an adolescent clinic at MCV, in his final year of med school, he met Linda Edquist, a fellow VCU student who volunteered in the clinic. Soon after graduation, Patch, Linda, and friends founded the Gesundheit! Institute (originally known to many as the Zanies), which ran as a free community hospital for 12 years. Adams and Edquist married in 1975 and had two sons, Atomic Zagnut ""Zag"" Adams and Lars Zig Edquist Adams. The couple divorced in 1998. Gesundheit! Institute. A revamped Gesundheit! Institute, envisioned as a free, full-scale hospital and health care eco-community, is planned on in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. Its goal is to integrate a traditional hospital with alternative medicine, with the organization developing educational programs in sustainable systems design targeted to medical students and the general public. Since the 1990s Adams has supported the Ithaca Health Alliance (IHA), founded as the Ithaca Health Fund (IHF) by Paul Glover. In January 2006 IHA launched the Ithaca Free Clinic, bringing to life key aspects of Adams' vision. Adams has also given strong praise to ""Health Democracy"", Glover's book written and published the same year. In October 2007, Adams and the Gesundheit Board unveiled its campaign to raise $1 million towards building a Teaching Center and Clinic on its land in West Virginia. The Center and Clinic will enable Gesundheit to see patients and teach health care design. Adams urges medical students to develop compassionate connections with their patients. His prescription for this kind of care relies on humor and play, which he sees as essential to physical and emotional health. Ultimately, Adams wants the Gesundheit! Institute to open a 40-bed hospital in rural West Virginia that offers free, holistic care to anyone who wants it. Adams was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award on January 29, 1997. In 2008, Adams agreed to become honorary chair of the ""International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment"" or IAACM. In a number of his speeches and essays, Martin Luther King, Jr. had called for such an IAACM, but none was ever created. MindFreedom International, a nonprofit coalition that Gesundheit! belongs to as a sponsor group, launched the IAACM to support ""creative maladjustment"" and social change. Adams still leads trips to cheer kids up all over the world. He also teaches at one session of Wavy Gravy's circus camp ""Camp Winnarainbow"". In media. The 1998 film ""Patch Adams"" was based on Adams' life and views on medicine. Adams has criticized the film, saying it eschewed an accurate representation of his beliefs in favor of commercial viability. He said that out of all aspects of his life and activism, the film portrayed him merely as a funny doctor. Patch Adams also said of Robin Williams in an interview, ""He made $21 million for four months of pretending to be me, in a very simplistic version, and did not give $10 to my free hospital. Patch Adams, the person, would have, if I had Robin's money, given ""all"" $21 million to a free hospital in a country where 80 million cannot get care."" However, in another interview, Adams did clarify that he did not dislike Williams, and Williams has actively supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for several years. As a speaker, Dr. Adams travels around the globe lecturing about his medicine methods. "
wikipedia-375528," Value chain  A value chain is a chain of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. The concept comes from business management and was first described and popularized by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, ""Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance"". The concept of value chains as decision support tools, was added on to the competitive strategies paradigm developed by Porter as early as 1979. In Porter's value chains, Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Marketing and Sales and Service are categorized as primary activities. Secondary activities include Procurement, Human Resource management, Technological Development and Infrastructure.  According to the OECD Secretary-General the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises. Global value chains (GVCs). Often multinational enterprises (MNEs) developed global value chains, investing abroad and establishing affiliates that provided critical support to remaining activities at home. To enhance efficiency and to optimize profits, multinational enterprises locate ""research, development, design, assembly, production of parts, marketing and branding"" activities in different countries around the globe. MNEs offshore labour-intensive activities to China price and Mexico, for example, where the cost of labor is the lowest. the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises. Through global value chains, there has been growth in interconnectedness as MNEs play an increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business. In response, governments have cut Corporate income tax (CIT) rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscape. Firm-level. The appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit, (not division or corporate level). Products pass through activities of a chain in order, and at each activity the product gains some value. Chain of activities gives the product more added value than sum of the independent activities' values. The activity of a diamond cutter can illustrate the difference between cost and the value chain. The cutting activity may have a low cost, but the activity adds much of the value to the end product, since a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a cut diamond. Typically, the described value chain and the documentation of processes, assessment and auditing of adherence to the process routines are at the core of the quality certification of the business, e.g. ISO 9001. Activities. The value chain categorizes the generic value-adding activities of an organization. The activities considered under this product/service enhancement process can be broadly categorized under two major activity-sets. In practice , no progressive organisation can afford to remain stuck to any one of these value chains. In order to cover both market spaces (physical world and cyber world), organisations need to deploy their very best practices in both of these spaces to churn out the most informative data, which can further be used to improve the ongoing products/services or to develop some new product/service. Hence organisations today try to employ the combined value chain. Combined Value Chain = Physical Value shown in sample below. A good look at this value-chain matrix indicates that there are a number of locations in any business process to add value or to improve the process, which in turn will help in saving money and time while improving the performance. The basic idea is same age-old concept of utilizing the input of information, whatever the source. A firm's value chain forms part of a larger stream of activities, which Porter calls a ""value system"". A value system, or an industry value chain, includes the suppliers that provide the inputs necessary to the firm along with their value chains. After the firm creates products, these products pass through the value chains of distributors (which also have their own value chains), all the way to the customers. All parts of these chains are included in the value system. To achieve and sustain a competitive advantage, and to support that advantage with information technologies, a firm must understand every component of this value system. Industry-level. An industry value-chain is a physical representation of the various processes involved in producing goods (and services), starting with raw materials and ending with the delivered product (also known as the supply chain). It is based on the notion of value-added at the link (read: stage of production) level. The sum total of link-level value-added yields total value. The French Physiocrats' ""Tableau économique"" is one of the earliest examples of a value chain. Wasilly Leontief's Input-Output tables, published in the 1950s, provide estimates of the relative importance of each individual link in industry-level value-chains for the U.S. economy. Significance. The value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning. The simpler concept of value streams, a cross-functional process which was developed over the next decade, had some success in the early 1990s. The value-chain concept has been extended beyond individual firms. It can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks. The delivery of a mix of products and services to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors, each managing its own value chain. The industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain, sometimes global in extent. Porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the ""value system"". A value system includes the value chains of a firm's supplier (and their suppliers all the way back), the firm itself, the firm distribution channels, and the firm's buyers (and presumably extended to the buyers of their products, and so on). Capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists. For example, a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models, or in other ways create improvements in its value system. Value chain analysis has also been successfully used in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how work selection, work planning, work scheduling and finally work execution can (when considered as elements of chains) help drive lean approaches to maintenance. The Maintenance Value Chain approach is particularly successful when used as a tool for helping change management as it is seen as more user-friendly than other business process tools. A value chain approach could also offer a meaningful alternative to evaluate private or public companies when there is a lack of publicly known data from direct competition, where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Value chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain. Although commonly associated with export-oriented trade, development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intra-regional chains in addition to international ones. SCOR. The Supply-Chain Council, a global trade consortium in operation with over 700 member companies, governmental, academic, and consulting groups participating in the last 10 years, manages the Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), the ""de facto"" universal reference model for Supply Chain including Planning, Procurement, Manufacturing, Order Management, Logistics, Returns, and Retail; Product and Service Design including Design Planning, Research, Prototyping, Integration, Launch and Revision, and Sales including CRM, Service Support, Sales, and Contract Management which are congruent to the Porter framework. The ""SCOR"" framework has been adopted by hundreds of companies as well as national entities as a standard for business excellence, and the U.S. Department of Defense has adopted the newly launched Design-Chain Operations Reference (DCOR) framework for product design as a standard to use for managing their development processes. In addition to process elements, these reference frameworks also maintain a vast database of standard process metrics aligned to the Porter model, as well as a large and constantly researched database of prescriptive universal best practices for process execution. Value Reference Model. A Value Reference Model (VRM) developed by the trade consortium Value Chain Group offers an open source semantic dictionary for value chain management encompassing one unified reference framework representing the process domains of product development, customer relations and supply networks. The integrated process framework guides the modeling, design, and measurement of business performance by uniquely encompassing the plan, govern and execute requirements for the design, product, and customer aspects of business. The Value Chain Group claims VRM to be next generation Business Process Management that enables value reference modeling of all business processes and provides product excellence, operations excellence, and customer excellence. Six business functions of the value chain: This guide to the right provides the levels 1-3 basic building blocks for value chain configurations. All Level 3 processes in VRM have input/output dependencies, metrics and practices. The VRM can be extended to levels 4-6 via the Extensible Reference Model schema. "
wikipedia-375542," 2003 Heritage Classic  The Heritage Classic was an outdoor ice hockey game played on November 22, 2003, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first National Hockey League game to be played outdoors as a part of regular season play. The Heritage Classic concept was modeled after the success of the ""Cold War"" game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in 2001. The game was given the tagline ""A November to Remember"". The event took place in Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium in front of a crowd of 57,167, despite temperatures of close to −18 °C, −30 °C (−22 °F) with wind chill. It was held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Edmonton Oilers joining the NHL in 1979 and the 20th anniversary of their first Stanley Cup win in 1984. The CBC television broadcast drew 2.747 million viewers in Canada, the second-highest audience for a regular-season NHL game. This was the first NHL game broadcast in HD on CBC. First, the ""MegaStars"" game was played between some of the best former players from both clubs. The Oilers were represented by the best players from their 1980s dynasty, led by Wayne Gretzky. The Canadiens were represented by players from their 1970s dynasty, led by Guy Lafleur, and a few members of the 1986 and 1993 championship squads. Both teams were composed of players who had won Stanley Cups with the Oilers or Canadiens, except for the Oilers' first NHL captain Ron Chipperfield and the Canadiens' Russ Courtnall who Rejean Houle said was selected for his speed. Cam Connor and Mark Napier were the only players that played for both the Oilers and the Canadiens during their NHL careers. Connor and Napier played for the Canadiens during the Heritage Classic game. Mark Messier, the only active player at the time, got special permission from the New York Rangers front office to compete for Edmonton in the game and was the only player in the game to wear a helmet. The ""MegaStars"" game consisted of two fifteen-minute halves rather than three 20 minute periods, and was won by the Oilers by a score of 2–0. After the game, Messier jokingly called the low-scoring contest ""a typical Oilers win,"" a reference to the numerous high-scoring games of the Oilers' heyday in the 1980s. The second game was between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. Montreal won the game 4–3. Richard Zednik of the Montreal Canadiens scored the first goal of the game, and also scored the game-winner. Goalie Jose Theodore wore a Canadiens tuque over the top of his goalie mask. The game was released to DVD by the CBC, and included special features such as player interviews. Following the success of the Heritage Classic, in 2008 the league began a series of Winter Classics, an outdoor regular season game played annually on New Years Day, which to date have all taken place in American-based NHL cities. The first NHL game to be played outdoors was an exhibition game on September 27, 1991, when the Los Angeles Kings played the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The next outdoor game to be awarded by the league to a Canadian-based NHL city was the 2011 Heritage Classic in Calgary, Alberta, part of the Heritage Classic series of games. "
wikipedia-375565," Jewish religious movements  Jewish religious movements () (), sometimes called ""denominations"" or ""branches"", include different groups which have developed among Jews from ancient times and especially in the modern era among Ashkenazi Jews living in anglophone countries. Despite the efforts of several of these movements to expand their membership in Israel and achieve official recognition by the Israeli government, non-Orthodox movements have remained largely a feature of Judaism in the diaspora. Historically, the division of Jews in many Western countries into denominations, which in the United States in particular took the form of three large groups known as Orthodox, Conservative and Reform, can be traced to Jewish reaction to the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and its aftermath, and to a certain extent the philosophies of these movements were shaped in reaction to one another. Several smaller movements have emerged in the years since. In more recent years, all of these movements have been shaped by the challenge of assimilation. The movements differ in their views on various religious issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding Jewish Law, biblical authorship, textual criticism, and the nature or role of the messiah (or messianic age). Across these movements, there are marked differences in liturgy, especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the ""liberal denominations"" or ""progressive streams."" Terminology. Some Jews reject the term ""denomination"" as a label for different groups and ideologies within Judaism, arguing that the notion of denomination has a specifically Christian resonance that does not translate easily into the Jewish context. However, in recent years the ""American Jewish Year Book"" has adopted ""denomination,"" as have many scholars and theologians. Other commonly used terms are ""movements"", ""branches"", ""trends"", ""streams"", or even ""flavors"" of Judaism. This article uses the terms interchangeably, without purporting to affirm the validity of one term over another. The Jewish denominations themselves reject characterization as sects. Sects are traditionally defined as religious subgroups that have broken off from the main body, and this separation usually becomes irreparable over time. Within Judaism, individuals and families often switch affiliation, and individuals are free to marry one another, although the major denominations disagree on who is a Jew. It is not unusual for clergy and Jewish educators trained in one of the liberal denominations to serve in another, and left with no choice, many small Jewish communities combine elements of several movements to achieve a viable level of membership. Relationships between Jewish religious movements are varied; they are sometimes marked by interdenominational cooperation outside of the realm of halakha (Jewish Law), and sometimes not. Some of the movements sometimes cooperate by uniting with one another in community federations and in campus organizations such as the Hillel Foundation. Jewish religious denominations are distinct from, but often linked to, Jewish ethnic divisions and Jewish political movements. Judaism and Samaritans. The Samaritans regard themselves as direct descendants of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in the northern Kingdom of Israel, which was conquered by Assyria in 722 BCE. The first historical references to the Samaritans date from the Babylonian Exile. The attitude of the Talmud to the Samaritans is that they are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice agrees with the mainstream but are otherwise to be treated as non-Jews. Modern genetics has suggested some truth to both the claims of the Samaritans and Jewish accounts in the Talmud. Samaritan scripture preserves a version of the Pentateuch in slightly variant forms. The Samaritans have dwindled to two communities numbering about 700 individuals. One is located in the Israeli city of Holon, while the other is located near Nablus on Mount Gerizim, in the West Bank. Jewish sects in the Second Temple period. In the decades before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Jewish people in the Roman province of Iudaea were divided into several movements, sometimes warring among themselves: Saducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots. Many historic sources, from Flavius Josephus to the Christian New Testament to the recovered fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, attest to the divisions among Jews at this time. Rabbinical writings from later periods, including the Talmud, attest further to these ancient schisms. Karaite Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism. Most streams of modern Judaism developed from the Pharisee movement, which became known as Rabbinic Judaism (in Hebrew ""Yahadut Rabanit"" - יהדות רבנית) with the compilation of the oral law into Mishna. After the destruction of the Second Temple and the Bar Kokhba revolt, the other movements disappeared from the historical record. Karaite Judaism (in Hebrew ""Kara'im"" - קראים - ""readers"") started in the 9th Century when Anan Ben David and his followers rejected the oral law. Modern Karaites accept only the Tanakh as divinely inspired, not recognizing the authority of the Talmud and the Midrashim. In the 10th century, the Karaites were believed to have comprised about 10% of the world's Jewish population. At the time of the traveler Benjamin of Tudela in the 12th century, Karaites were widely dispersed around the eastern Mediterranean, both in Islamic areas and the Byzantine Empire. Benjamin describes Karaite communities in many of the places he visited. In the early 20th century, small Karaite communities remained in Egypt, Turkey, the Crimea, and Lithuania. Today, there are about 30,000 Karaite Jews in the world, most of whom live in Israel. Traditionally, Rabbinic Judaism has regarded the Karaites as Jewish, but with an incorrect philosophical understanding of the Torah. Background: Jewish ethnic and cultural divisions. Traditionally, Judaism is not divided into religious traditions based on theological difference. However, a wide array of Jewish communities have developed independently, distinguishable by their varying practices in matters that are ""not"" considered central ideas within Judaism, such as Maimonides' list of the Jewish principles of faith. Although there are numerous Jewish ethnic communities, there are several that are large enough to be considered ""predominant."" Ashkenazi communities compose about 75% of the world's Jewish population, and Sephardic communities and the Mizrahi Jewish communities—the ""Arab"" and ""Persian"" Jews—compose the greatest part of the rest, with about 20% of the world's Jewish population. Together these ethnic groups compose 95% of the world's Jewish population. The remaining 5% of Jews are divided among a wide array of small groups (perhaps the Beta Israel group of Ethopian Jews is the most important), some of which are nearing extinction as a result of assimilation and intermarriage into surrounding non-Jewish cultures or surrounding Jewish cultures. The Enlightenment had a tremendous effect on Jewish identity and on ideas about the importance and role of Jewish observance. Due to the geographical distribution and the geopolitical entities affected by the Enlightenment, this philosophical revolution essentially affected only the Ashkenazi community; however, because of the predominance of the Ashkenazi community in Israeli politics and in Jewish leadership worldwide, the effects have been significant for all Jews. Sephardic Judaism. Sephardic Judaism is the practice of Judaism as observed by the Sephardi (Spanish and Portuguese Jews), Maghrebim and Mizrahi Jews, so far as it is peculiar to themselves and not shared with other Jewish groups such as the Ashkenazim (German Rite). Sephardic Judaism does not constitute a separate denomination within Judaism, but rather a separate cultural tradition. Sephardim are, primarily, the descendants of Jews from the Iberian peninsula. They may be divided into the families that left in the Expulsion of 1492 and those that remained as crypto-Jews, Marranos and those who left in the following few centuries. In religious parlance, and by many in modern Israel, the term is used in a broader sense to include all Jews of Ottoman or other Asian or African backgrounds (Mizrachi Jews), whether or not they have any historic link to Spain, though some prefer to distinguish between Sephardim proper and Mizraḥi Jews. Sephardic Judaism lacks movements such as 'Orthodox', 'conservative' or 'reform'; level of halachic observance is left to each person, but none dispute that contemporary definitions of 'orthodox' represents the level of observance of most Sephardim. Sephardic and Mizrachi Jewish temples are generally considered ""orthodox"" by non-sephardic Jews and are primarily run according to the orthodox tradition, even though many of the congregants may not keep a level of observance on par with traditional orthodox belief. For example, many congregants will drive to the temple on the sabbath in violation of halacha, while discreetly entering the synagogue so as not to offend more observant congregants. Unlike the predominantly Ashkenazi Reform, and Reconstructionist denominations, Sephardic and Mizrachi Jews who are not observant generally believe that orthodox Judaism's interpretation and legislation of halacha is appropriate and true to the original philosophy of Judaism. That being said, Sephardic and Mizrachi Rabbis tend to hold different, and generally more lenient, positions on halacha than their Ashkenazi counterparts, but since these positions are based on rulings of Talmudic scholars as well as well documented traditions that can be linked back to well known codifiers of Jewish law, Ashkenazi and Hasidic Rabbis do not believe that these positions are incorrect, but rather that they are the appropriate interpretation of halacha for Jews of Sephardic and Mizrachi descent. Hasidic Judaism. Hasidic Judaism was founded by Israel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), also known as the Baal Shem Tov or the Besht (the Hebrew and Yiddish acronym of Baal Shem Tov). His disciples attracted many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two notorious Jewish false messiahs Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791) and their respective followers. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Europe. It first came to the United States during the large waves of Jewish emigration beginning in the 1880s. In the late 18th century, there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed Mitnagdim (""opponents"") by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov, who had previously called themselves Freylechn (""happy ones"") and now began to call themselves Hasidim (""pious ones""). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Since then all the sects of Hasidic Judaism have been subsumed theologically into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly Haredi Judaism, although cultural differences persist. See the articles on Hasidic Judaism and Mitnagdim for more detailed information. Modern movements or denominations. Perhaps the greatest divisions since the time of the division between the Sadducees and Pharisees two millennia ago are the divisions within the Ashkenazic community that have arisen in the past two centuries, ever since the Enlightenment and the Renaissance influenced Jews from northern and eastern Europe. The first evidence of this great dogmatic schism was the development of the Reform Judaism movement, which rejected ""ethnic Judaism"" and preferred to regard Judaism as a religion rather than an ethnicity or a culture. Over time three large movements emerged: Additionally, a number of smaller groups have emerged: Development of modern ""denominations"". Development of denominations or movements has been primarily a phenomenon among Ashkenazi Jews who have immigrated to Anglophone countries. Much of the literature of these denominations is in English, not Hebrew. Their development can be seen as both a response to the western Enlightenment and to emancipation and immigration. Response to Haskalah or Jewish Enlightenment. In the late 18th century Europe, and then the rest of the world, was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements that taken together were referred to as the Enlightenment. These movements promoted scientific thinking, free thought, and allowed people to question previously unshaken religious dogmas. The emancipation of the Jews in many European communities, and the Haskalah movement started by Moses Mendelssohn, brought the Enlightenment to the Jewish community. In response to the challenges of integrating Jewish life with Enlightenment values, German Jews in the early 19th century began to develop the concept of Reform Judaism, adapting Jewish practice to the new conditions of an increasingly urbanized and secular community. Staunch opponents of the Reform movement became known as Orthodox Jews. Later, members of the Reform movement who felt that it was moving away from tradition too quickly formed the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who were sympathetic to the Haskalah formed what became known as neo-Orthodox or modern Orthodox Jews. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah became known as Haredi Jews. Response to immigration. The particular forms which the denominations have taken on have been shaped by immigration of the Ashkenazi Jewish communities, once concentrated in eastern and central Europe, to western and mostly Anglophone countries (in particular, in North America). In the middle of the 20th Century, the institutional division of North American Jewry between Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements still reflected immigrant origins. Reform Jews at that time were predominantly of German or western European origin, while both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism came primarily from eastern European countries. Response to Israel and Zionism. The issue of Zionism was once very divisive in the Jewish community. Non-Zionists believed that Jews should integrate into the countries in which they lived, rather than moving to the Land of Israel. The original founders of Reform Judaism in Germany rejected traditional prayers for the restoration of Jerusalem. Also, the view among Reform Jews that Judaism was strictly a religion and that Jews should be loyal citizens of their host nations led to a non-Zionist, and sometimes anti-Zionist, stance. Orthodox non-Zionists believed that the return to Israel could only happen with the coming of the Messiah, and that a political attempt to re-establish a Jewish state was contrary to God's plan. After events of the 20th century, most importantly the Holocaust and the establishment of the modern State of Israel, opposition to Zionism largely disappeared within Reform Judaism. Secular opposition to Zionism has continued among some Jewish political groups, and among some Jews active in leftist political movements. Among most religious non-Zionists, there is a de facto recognition of Israel, but as a secular state. The Edah Chareidis in Jerusalem does not recognize the legitimacy of the state, and one small group, Neturei Karta, actively opposes the existence of Israel. (See Haredim and Zionism.) Response to pressures of assimilation. Among the most striking differences between the Jewish movements in the 21st century is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have been most accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and raise children as Jewish. Emergence of trans- and post-denominational Judaism. The very idea of Jewish denominationalism is contested by some Jews and Jewish organizations, which consider themselves to be ""trans-denominational"" or ""post-denominational."" A variety of new Jewish organizations are emerging that lack such affiliations: Organizations such as these believe that the formal divisions that have arisen among the ""denominations"" in contemporary Jewish history are unnecessarily divisive, as well as religiously and intellectually simplistic. According to Rachel Rosenthal, ""the post-denominational Jew refuses to be labeled or categorized in a religion that thrives on stereotypes. He has seen what the institutional branches of Judaism have to offer and believes that a better Judaism can be created."" Such Jews might, out of necessity, affiliate with a synagogue associated with a particular movement, but their own personal Jewish ideology is often shaped by a variety of influences from more than one denomination.

wikipedia-375566," Vasili Mitrokhin  Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin (; March 3, 1922 – January 23, 2004) was a Major and senior archivist for the Soviet Union's foreign intelligence service, the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, and co-author with Christopher Andrew of ""The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West"", a massive account of Soviet intelligence operations based on copies of material from the archive. The second volume, ""The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB in the World"", was published in 2005, soon after Mitrokhin's death. Education. Mitrokhin was born in Yurasovo, in Central Russia, Ryazan Oblast, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After leaving school, he entered artillery school, then attended university in Kazakh SSR, graduating with degrees in history and law. Career. Military. Towards the end of the second World War, Mitrokhin took a job in the military procurator's office at Kharkov in the Ukrainian SSR. He entered the MGB as a foreign intelligence officer in 1948. His first foreign posting was in 1952. During the 1950s he served on various undercover assignments overseas. In 1956, for example, he accompanied the Soviet team to the Olympic Games in Australia. But later that year, after he had apparently mishandled an operational assignment, he was moved from operational duties to the archives of the KGB's First Chief Directorate, and told he would never work in the field again. Disillusionment. Mitrokhin sometimes dated the beginnings of his disillusionment to Nikita Khrushchev's famous speech to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union congress denouncing Joseph Stalin, though it seems he may have been harbouring doubts for some time before that. For years he had listened to broadcasts on the BBC and Voice of America, noting the gulf between their reports and party propaganda. Yet when he began looking into the archives, he claimed to have been shocked by what he discovered about the KGB's systematic repression of the Soviet people. ""I could not believe such evil,"" he recalled. ""It was all planned, prepared, thought out in advance. It was a terrible shock when I read things."" Between 1972 and 1984 he supervised the move of the archive of the First Chief Directorate from the Lubyanka to the new KGB headquarters at Yasenevo. While doing so he made copies and immensely detailed notes of documents from the archive. He retired in 1985. Defection. In the Soviet era Mitrokhin made no attempts to contact any western intelligence service. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (in 1992) he traveled to Latvia with copies of material from the archive and walked into the American embassy in Riga. Central Intelligence Agency officers there did not consider him to be credible, concluding that the copied documents could be faked. He then went to the British embassy and a young diplomat there saw his potential and after a further appointment one month later with representatives of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) operations followed to retrieve the 25,000 pages of files hidden in his house, covering operations from as far back as the 1930s. He and his family were then exfiltrated to Britain, although authorities of Yeltsin's Russia were not creating any obstacles for free traveling abroad of active or retired members of secret services or members of their families. Richard Tomlinson, the MI6 officer imprisoned in 1997 for attempting to publish a book about his career, was one of those involved in retrieving the documents from containers hidden under the floor of the dacha. Mitrokhin Archive. These works are collectively referred to as the Mitrokhin Archives. "
wikipedia-375567," Andrei Gromyko  Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko (; ;  – 2 July 1989) was a Soviet statesman during the Cold War. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1957–1985) and as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1985–1988). Gromyko was responsible for many top decisions on Soviet foreign policy until he retired in 1988. In the 1940s Western pundits called him ""Mr. Nyet"" (""Mr. No""), because of his frequent use of the Soviet veto in the UN Security Council. Gromyko's political career started in 1939 with his employment at the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (renamed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946). In 1943 Gromyko became the Soviet ambassador to the United States, leaving in 1946 to become the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Upon his return to the Soviet Union he became a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and later the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He went on to become the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1952. Gromyko played a direct role in the Cuban Missile Crisis in his role as the Soviet Foreign Minister. Gromyko helped negotiate arms limitations treaties such as the ABM Treaty, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and SALT I and II among others. Under Leonid Brezhnev's leadership Gromyko helped build the policy of détente between the US and the USSR. He supported Mikhail Gorbachev's candidacy for General Secretary in 1985. Gromyko lost his office as foreign minister when Gorbachev became General Secretary, and was instead appointed to the largely ceremonial office of head of state. Gromyko retired from political life in 1988 and died the following year in Moscow. Early life. Background and youth. Gromyko was born to a poor ""semi-peasant, semi-worker"" family in the Belarusian village of Staryja Gramyki, near Gomel on 18 July 1909. Gromyko's father, Andrei Matveyevich, worked as a seasonal worker in a local factory. Andrei Matveyevich was not a very educated man, having only attended four years of school, but knew how to read and write. He had fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Gromyko's mother, Olga Jevgenyevna, came from a poor peasant family in the neighbouring city of Sjelesniki. She attended school only for a short period of time as, when her father died, she left to help her mother with the harvest. Gromyko grew up near the district town of Vetka where most of the inhabitants were devoted Old Believers in the Russian Orthodox Church. Gromyko's own village was also predominantly religious, but Gromyko started doubting the supernatural at a very early age. His first dialog on the subject was with his grandmother Marfa, who answered his inquiry about God with ""Wait until you get older. Then you will understand all this much better"". According to Gromyko, ""Other adults said basically the same thing"" when talking about religion. Gromyko's neighbour at the time, Mikhail Sjeljutov, was a freethinker and introduced Gromyko to new non-religious ideas and told Gromyko that scientists were beginning to doubt the existence of God. From the age of nine, after the Bolshevik revolution, Gromyko started reading atheist propaganda in flyers and pamphlets. At the age of thirteen Gromyko became a member of the Komsomol and held anti-religious speeches in the village with his friends as well as promoting Communist values. The news that Germany had attacked the Russian Empire in August 1914 came without warning to the local population. This was the first time, as Gromyko notes, that he felt ""love for his country"". His father, Andrei Matveyevich, was again conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army and would serve for three years on the southwestern front, under the leadership of General Aleksei Brusilov. Andrei Matveyevich returned home on the eve of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. In the beginning of 1923 Gromyko was elected First Secretary of the local Komsomol chapter. Following Vladimir Lenin's death in 1924 the villagers asked Gromyko what would happen in the leader's absence. Gromyko remembered a communist slogan from the heyday of the October Revolution: ""The revolution was carried through by Lenin and his ""helpers""."" He then told the villagers that Lenin was dead but ""his aides, the Party, still lived on."" Education and party membership. When he was young Gromyko's mother Olga told him that he should leave his home town to become an educated man. Gromyko followed his mother's advice and, after finishing seven years of primary school and vocational education in Gomel, he moved to Borisov to attended technical school. Gromyko became a member of the All-Union Communist Party Bolsheviks in 1931, something he had dreamed of since he learned about the ""difference between a poor farmer and a landowner, a worker and a capitalist"". Gromyko was voted in as secretary of his party cell at his first party conference and would use most of his weekends doing volunteer work. Gromyko received a very small stipend to live on, but still had a strong nostalgia for the days when he worked as a volunteer. It was about this time that Gromyko met his future wife, Lydia Dmitrievna Grinevich. Grinevich was the daughter of a Belarusian peasant family and came from Kamenki, a small village to the west of Minsk. She and Gromyko would have two children, Anatoly and Emilia. After studying in Borisov for two years Gromyko was appointed principal of a secondary school in Dzerzhinsk, where he taught, supervised the school and continued his studies. One day a representative from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia offered him an opportunity to do post-graduate work in Minsk. Gromyko traveled to Minsk for an interview with the head of the university, I.M. Borisevitsj, who explained that a new post-graduate program had been formed for training in economics; Gromyko's record in education and social work made him a desirable candidate. Gromyko advised Borisevitsj that he would have difficulty living on a meager student stipend. Borisevitsj assured him that on finishing the program his salary would be at the party's top pay grade -- ""a decent living wage."" Gromyko accepted the offer, moving his family to Minsk in 1933. Gromyko and the other post-graduates were invited to an anniversary reception at which, as recounted in Gromyko's ""Memoirs"": ""We were amazed to find ourselves treated as equals and placed at their table to enjoy what for us was a sumptuous feast. We realised then that not for nothing did the Soviet state treat its scientists well: evidently science and those who worked in it were highly regarded by the state.""  After that day of pleasantry Gromyko for the first time in his life wanted to enter higher education but in 1934, without warning, Gromyko and his family were moved to Moscow, settling in the north eastern Alexeyevsky District. In 1936, after another three years of studying economics, Gromyko became a researcher and lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new job would be a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy. (The Great Purge of 1938 opened many positions in the diplomatic corps). Gromyko recognised such familiar faces as Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Malenkov. A couple of days later he was transferred from the Academy of Sciences to the diplomatic service. Ambassador and World War II. In the spring of 1939, Gromyko started working for the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in Moscow. Gromyko became the Head of the Department of Americas and because of his position Gromyko met with American ambassador to the Soviet Union Lawrence Steinhardt. Gromyko believed Steinhardt to be ""totally uninterested in creating good relations between the US and the USSR"" and that Steinhardt's successor Joseph Davies was more ""colourful"" and seemed ""genuinely interested"" in improving the relations between the two countries. Davies received the Order of Lenin for his work in trying to improve diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR. After heading the Americas department for 6 months, Gromyko was called upon by Joseph Stalin. Stalin started the conversation by telling Gromyko that he would be sent to the Soviet embassy in the United States to become second-in-command. ""The Soviet Union,"" Stalin said, ""should maintain reasonable relations with such a powerful country like the United States, especially in light of the growing fascist threat"". Vyacheslav Molotov contributed with some minor modifications but mostly agreed with what Stalin had said. ""How are your English skills improving?,"" Stalin asked, ""Comrade Gromyko you should pay a visit or two to an American church and listen to their sermons. Priests usually speak correct English with good accents. Do you know that the Russian revolutionaries when they were abroad, always followed this practice to improve their skills in foreign languages?"" Gromyko was quite amazed about what Stalin had just told him but he never visited an American church. Gromyko had never been abroad before and, to get to the United States, he had to travel via airplane through Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to Genoa, Italy, where they boarded a ship to the United States. Italy became the first capitalist country in which Gromyko set foot. He later wrote in his ""Memoirs"" that New York City was a good example on how humans, by the ""means of wealth and technology are able to create something that is totally alien to our nature"". He further noticed the New York working districts which, in his own opinion, were proof of the inhumanity of capitalism and of the system's greed. Gromyko met and consulted with most of the senior officers of the United States government during his first days and succeeded Maxim Litvinov as ambassador to the United States in 1943. In his ""Memoirs"" Gromyko wrote fondly of President Franklin D. Roosevelt even though he believed him to be a representative of the bourgeoisie class. During his time as ambassador, Gromyko met prominent personalities such as British actor Charlie Chaplin, American actress Marilyn Monroe and British economist John Maynard Keynes. Gromyko was a Soviet delegate to the Tehran, Dumbarton Oaks, Yalta and Potsdam conferences. In 1943, the same year as the Teheran conference, the USSR established diplomatic relations with Cuba and Gromyko was appointed the Soviet ambassador to Havana. Gromyko claimed that the accusations brought against Roosevelt by American right-wingers, that he was a socialist sympathizer, were absurd. While he started out as a member delegate Gromyko later became the head of the Soviet delegation to the San Francisco conference after Molotov's departure. When he later returned to Moscow to celebrate the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War, Stalin commended him saying a good diplomat was ""worth two or three armies at the front"". At the helm of Soviet foreign policy. The United Nations. Gromyko was granted the office of Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations (UN) in April 1946. The USSR supported the election of the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, a former Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs. But according to Gromyko, Lie became an active supporter in the ""expansionist behaviour"" of the United States and supported so-called ""American aggressionist"" policy. Because of this political stance, Gromyko believed Lie to be a bad Secretary-General. Trygve's successor, the Swede Dag Hammarskjöld, also promoted what Gromyko saw as ""anti-Soviet policies"". U Thant, the third Secretary-General, once told Gromyko that it was close to impossible to have an objective opinion of the USSR in the Secretariat of the United Nations, because the majority of secretariat members were of American ethnicity or supporters of the United States. Gromyko often used the Soviet veto power on behalf of the Soviet Union in the early days of the United Nations. So familiar was a Soviet veto in the early days of the UN that Gromyko became known as ""Mr Nyet"", literally meaning ""Mr No"". During the first 10 years of the UN, the Soviet Union used its veto 79 times. In the same period, the Republic of China used the veto once, France twice and the others not at all. Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom. Gromyko was appointed Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom at a June 1952 meeting with Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin. Stalin went back and forth as normal and told Gromyko about the importance of his new office, saying ""The United Kingdom now has the opportunity to play a greater role in international politics. But it is not clear in which direction the British government with their great diplomatic experience will steer their efforts [...] This is why we need people who understand their way of thinking"". Gromyko handed over his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II to make his role as ambassador official. Gromyko met up with Winston Churchill, again in 1952, not to talk about current politics but about World War II in nostalgia. Gromyko met Churchill again in 1953 to talk about their experiences during World War II and this was the last time Gromyko ever talked to Churchill face-to-face as his return was not likely after the credentials of his role as ambassador had been revoked when he was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Gromyko spent his initial days as Minister of Foreign Affairs solving problems between his ministry and the International Department (ID) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) headed by Boris Ponomarev. Ponomarev advocated for an expanded role for the ID in Soviet foreign relations, Gromyko flatly refused it. Valentin Falin, a top Soviet official, said the ID ""interfered in the activities"" of Gromyko and his ministry countless times. Gromyko both disliked Ponomarev and the power sharing between the ID and the foreign ministry. In 1958 Mao Zedong tried to look for supporters within the Soviet leadership for his planned war with the Republic of China (Taiwan). He flabbergasted Gromyko by telling him that he was willing to sacrifice the lives of ""300 million people"" just for the sake of annexing the Republic of China into the People's Republic of China. Gromyko assured Mao that the proposal would never get the approval of the Soviet leadership. When the Soviet leadership learnt of this discussion they responded by terminating the Soviet-Chinese nuclear program and various industrialization projects in the People's Republic of China. Years later Gromyko, during the Cuban Missile Crisis under Nikita Khrushchev, acting on the instruction of the Soviet leadership met John F. Kennedy, then President of the United States. Gromyko wrote in his ""Memoirs"" that Kennedy seemed out of touch when he first met him, he further claimed that Kennedy was not practical but instead very ideologically driven. Gromyko, in an interview in 1988, described Kennedy as nervous and said most of his arguments were contradictory. Threats towards Cuba were followed by assertions by the United States government that they were not planning any assaults on Cuba. During his twenty-eight years as Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko supported the policy of disarmament, stating in his ""Memoirs"" that ""Disarmament is the ideal of Socialism"". One accomplishment Gromyko took particular pride in was the signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty on 5 August 1963. The negotiations regarding the treaty had dragged on since 1958. But there were other achievements too such as when Gromyko, along with Alexei Kosygin, were able to get both Pakistan and India to sign the Tashkent Declaration—a peace treaty in the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965. Other achievements he considered his greatest were the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968, the ABM Treaty and SALT I, followed by the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1973. In retrospect Gromyko said, ""If we collect the deliberative nature of the documents, including hundreds of Coded Telegrams, information from the embassies, the analysis of the situation around these problems, there are perhaps as high as the mountain of Mont Blanc. Those papers show the difficulties in overcoming congestions to the path to an agreement, requires the present art of diplomacy."" Gromyko always believed in the superpower status of the Soviet Union and always promoted an idea that no important international agreement could be reached without its involvement. In 1972 he said ""no international problem of significance anywhere can be resolved without Soviet participation"". In 1966 he engaged in a dialog with Pope Paul VI, as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik, which resulted in greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe although there was still heavy persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union. Gromyko entered the Politburo in 1973 and, from there on, gradually took over the decision making of Soviet foreign policy. During his peak of personal influence Gromyko's policy was being built on the very same qualities which had underpinned his early career. His memory, which has been described by many as ""phenomenal"", had made him inflexible, un-imaginative and his total lack of a vision for the future led him to never think outside the box. As the Soviet economy was stagnating, Gromyko's diplomatic skills were of less importance as, during the leadership of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, Gromyko had adopted a more hard-line position than his superiors. After Brezhnev's death in 1982 Andropov was voted in as General Secretary by the Politburo. Immediately after his appointment Andropov asked Gromyko if he wanted to take over Brezhnev's old office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Gromyko turned down Andropov's offer, believing that Andropov would eventually take the office for himself. He did not believe that Andropov would take the office because of pure vanity, but rather due to its functions. After Andropov's death in 1984 and Chernenko's in 1985, Gromyko nominated Mikhail Gorbachev for the General Secretaryship on 11 March 1985. In supporting Gorbachev, Gromyko knew that the influence he carried would be strong. After being voted in Gorbachev relieved Gromyko of his duty as foreign minister and replaced him with Eduard Shevardnadze and Gromyko was appointed to the largely honorary position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Head of state, retirement and death. Gromyko held the office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, which was largely ceremonial, and his influence in ruling circles diminished. A number of First World journalists believed Gromyko was uncomfortable with many of Gorbachev's reforms, however, in his ""Memoirs"" Gromyko writes fondly of Gorbachev and the policy of perestroika. Gromyko believed that perestroika was about working for the construction of a socialist society and saw glasnost and perestroika as an attempt at making the USSR more democratic. During a party conference in July 1988 Vladimir Melnikov called for Gromyko's resignation. Melnikov blamed Brezhnev for the economic and political stagnation that had hit the Soviet Union and, seeing that Gromyko was a prominent member of the Brezhnev leadership, Gromyko was one of the men which had led the USSR into the crisis. Gromyko was promptly defended as ""a man respected by the people"" in a note by an anonymous delegate. After discussing it with his wife Gromyko decided to leave Soviet politics for good. Gromyko recounts in his ""Memoirs"" that he told Gorbachev that he wished to resign before he made it official. The following day, 1 October 1988, Gromyko sat beside Gorbachev, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov in the Supreme Soviet to make his resignation official: ""Such moments in life are just as memorable as when one is appointed to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me."" Gorbachev was formally named the leader of the Soviet Union after Gromyko's resignation. After his resignation Gorbachev praised Gromyko for his half-a-century of service to USSR. Critics, such as Alexander Belonogov the Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, claimed Gromyko's foreign policy was permeated with ""a spirit of intolerance and confrontation"". After retiring from active politics in 1989 Gromyko started working on his memoirs. Gromyko died on 2 July 1989, days before what would have been his 80th birthday, after being hospitalised for a vascular problem that was not further identified. His death was followed by a minute of silence at the Congress of People's Deputies to commemorate him. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS), the central news organ in the USSR, called him one of the country's most ""prominent leaders"". President of the United States George H. W. Bush sent his condolences to Gromyko's son, Anatoly. Gromyko was offered a grave in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, but at the request of his family he was not buried near the Kremlin wall but instead at the Novodevichy cemetery. Legacy. Having been a person of considerable stature during his life Gromyko held an unusual combination of personal characteristics. Some criticised Gromyko for being mundane and boring, while others were impressed by his diplomatic skills. An article written in 1981 in ""The Times"" said, ""He is one of the most active and efficient members of the Soviet leadership. A man with an excellent memory, a keen intellect and extraordinary endurance [...] Maybe Andrey is the most informed Minister for Foreign affairs in the world"". Gromyko's dour demeanour was shown clearly during his first term in Washington and echoed throughout his tenure as Soviet foreign minister. There is a story that Gromyko was leaving a Washington hotel one morning and was asked by a reporter; ""Minister Gromyko, did you enjoy your breakfast today?"" His response was ""Perhaps."" During his twenty-eight years as minister of foreign affairs Gromyko became the ""number-one"" on international diplomacy at home, renowned by his peers to be consumed by his work. Henry Kissinger once said ""If you can face Gromyko for one hour and survive, then you can begin to call yourself a diplomat"". Gromyko's work influenced Soviet and Russian ambassadors such as Anatoly Dobrynin. Mash Lewis and Gregory Elliott described Gromyko's main characteristic as his ""complete identification with the interest of the state and his faithful service to it"". According to historians Gregory Elliot and Moshe Lewin this could help explain his so-called ""boring"" personality and the mastery of his own ego. West German politician Egon Bahr, when commenting on Gromyko's memoirs, said; ""He has concealed a veritable treasure-trove from future generations and taken to the grave with him an inestimable knowledge of international connection between the historical events and major figures of his time, which only he could offer. What a pity that this very man proved incapable to the very end of evoking his experience. As a faithful servant of the state, he believed that he should restrict himself to a sober, concise presentation of the bare essentials."" On 18 July 2009, Belarus marked the 100th anniversary of Gromyko's birth with nationwide celebrations. In the city of his birth many people laid flowers in front of his bust. A ceremony was held attended by his son and daughter, Anatoly and Emiliya. Several exhibitions were opened and dedicated to his honour and a school and a street in Gomel were renamed in honour of him. "
wikipedia-375568," Congress Poland  The Kingdom of Poland ( ; , ""Korolevstvo Polskoye"", ""Tsarstvo Polskoye"", , , translation: Tsardom of Poland), informally known as Congress Poland ( or Russian Poland), created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, was a personal union of the Russian parcel of Poland with the Russian Empire. It was gradually politically integrated into Russia over the course of the 19th century, made an official part of the Russian Empire in 1867, and finally replaced during the Great War by the Central Powers in 1915 with the theoretically existing Regency Kingdom of Poland.  Though officially the Kingdom of Poland was a state with considerable political autonomy guaranteed by a liberal constitution, its rulers, the Russian Emperors, generally disregarded any restrictions on their power. Thus effectively it was little more than a puppet state of the Russian Empire. The autonomy was severely curtailed following uprisings in 1830–31 and 1863, as the country became governed by ""namestniks"", and later divided into guberniya (provinces). Thus from the start, Polish autonomy remained little more than fiction. The territory of the Kingdom of Poland roughly corresponds to the Kalisz Region and the Lublin, Łódź, Masovia and Świętokrzyskie voivodeships of Poland. Naming. Although the official name of the state was the ""Kingdom of Poland"", in order to distinguish it from other Kingdoms of Poland, it was sometimes referred to as ""Congress Poland"". History. The ""Kingdom of Poland"" was created out of the Duchy of Warsaw, a French client state, at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 when the great powers reorganized Europe following the Napoleonic wars. The creation of the Kingdom created a partition of Polish lands in which the state was divided among Russia, Austria and Prussia. The Congress was important enough in the creation of the state to cause the new country to be named for it. The Kingdom lost its status as a sovereign state in 1831 and the administrative divisions were reorganized. It was sufficiently distinct that its name remained in official Russian use, although in the later years of Russian rule it was replaced with the ""Privislinsky Krai"" (Russian: Привислинский Край). Following the defeat of the November Uprising its separate institutions and administrative arrangements were abolished as part of increased Russification to be more closely integrated with the Russian Empire. However, even after this formalized annexation, the territory retained some degree of distinctiveness and continued to be referred to informally as Congress Poland until the Russian rule there ended as a result of the advance by the armies of the Central Powers in 1915 during World War I. Originally, the Kingdom had an area of roughly 128,500 km2 and a population of approximately 3.3 million. The new state would be one of the smallest Polish states ever, smaller than the preceding Duchy of Warsaw and much smaller than the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which had a population of 10 million and an area of 1 million km2. Its population reached 6.1 million by 1870 and 10 million by 1900. Most of the ethnic Poles in the Russian Empire lived in the Congress Kingdom, although some areas outside it also contained Polish majority. The Kingdom of Poland largely re-emerged as a result of the efforts of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, a Pole who aimed to resurrect the Polish state in alliance with Russia. The Kingdom of Poland was one of the few contemporary constitutional monarchies in Europe, with the Emperor of Russia serving as the Polish King. His title as chief of Poland in Russian, was ""Tsar"", similar to usage in the fully integrated states within the Empire (Georgia, Kazan, Siberia). Initial independence. Theoretically the Polish Kingdom in its 1815 form was a semi-autonomous state in personal union with Russia through the rule of the Russian Emperor. The state possessed the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland, one of the most liberal in 19th century Europe, a Sejm (parliament) responsible to the King capable of voting laws, an independent army, currency, budget, penal code and a customs boundary separating it from the rest of Russian lands. Poland also had democratic traditions (Golden Liberty) and the Polish nobility deeply valued personal freedom. In reality, the Kings had absolute power and the formal title of ""Autocrat"", and wanted no restrictions on their rule. All opposition to the Emperor of Russia was suppressed and the law was disregarded at will by Russian officials. Though the absolute rule demanded by Russia was difficult to establish due to Poland's liberal traditions and institutions, the independence of the Kingdom lasted only 15 years; initially Alexander I used the title of the King of Poland and was obligated to observe resolutions of the constitution. However, in time the situation changed and he granted the viceroy, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, almost dictatorial powers. Very soon after Congress of Vienna resolutions were signed, Russia ceased to respect them. In 1819, Alexander I abolished freedom of the press and introduced preventory censorship. Resistance to Russian control began in 1820s. Russian secret police commanded by Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev started persecution of Polish secret organizations and in 1821 the King ordered the abolition of Freemasonry which represented patriotic traditions of Poland. Beginning in 1825 the sessions of the Sejm were held in secret. Uprisings and loss of autonomy. Alexander I's successor, Nicholas I was crowned King of Poland on 24 May 1829 in Warsaw, but he declined to swear to abide by the Constitution and continued to limit the independence of the Polish Kingdom. Nicholas' rule promoted the idea of Official Nationality, consisting of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality. In relation to Poles, those ideas meant assimilation: turning them into loyal Orthodox Russians. The principle of Orthodoxy was the result of the special role it played in Russian Empire, as the Church was in fact becoming a department of state, and other religions discriminated against; for instance, Papal bulls could not be read in the Kingdom of Poland without agreement from the Russian government. The rule of Nicholas also meant end of political traditions in Poland; democratic institutions were removed, an appointed - rather than elected - centralized administration was put in place, and efforts were made to change the relations between the state and the individual. All of this led to discontent and resistance among the Polish population. In January 1831, the Sejm deposed Nicholas I as King of Poland in response to his repeated curtailing of its constitutional rights. Nicholas reacted by sending Russian troops into Poland, resulting in the November Uprising. Following an 11-month military campaign, the Kingdom of Poland lost its semi-independence and was subsequently integrated much more closely with the Russian Empire. This was formalized through the issuing of the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland by the Emperor in 1832, which abolished the constitution, army and legislative assembly. Over the next 30 years a series of measures bound Congress Poland ever more closely to Russia. In 1863 the January Uprising broke out, but lasted only two years before being crushed. As a direct result, any remaining separate status of the Kingdom was removed and the political entity was directly incorporated into the Russian Empire. The formerly unofficial name of Privislinsky Krai (), i.e. 'Vistula Land', replaced 'Kingdom of Poland' as the area's official name and the area became a ""namestnichestvo"" under the control of a namestnik until 1875, when it became a Guberniya.  Government. The government of the Congress of Poland was outlined in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815. The Emperor of Russia was the official head of state, considered the King of Poland, with the local government headed by the Viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland (), Council of State and Administrative Council, in addition to the Sejm. In theory, Congress Poland possessed one of the most liberal governments of the time in Europe, but in practice the area was a puppet state of the Russian Empire. The liberal provisions of the constitution, and the scope of the autonomy, were often disregarded by the Russian officials. Executive Leadership. The office of """"Namestnik"""" was introduced in Poland by the 1815 constitution of Congress Poland. The Viceroy was chosen by the King from among the noble citizens of the Russian Empire or the Kingdom of Poland. The Viceroy supervised the entire public administration and, in the monarch's absence, chaired the Council of State, as well as the Administrative Council. He could veto the councils' decisions; other than that, his decisions had to be countersigned by the appropriate government minister. The Viceroy exercised broad powers and could nominate candidates for most senior government posts (ministers, senators, judges of the High Tribunal, councilors of state, referendaries, as well as bishops and archbishops). He had no competence in the realms of finances and foreign policy; his military competence varied. The office of ""namestnik"" or Viceroy was never officially abolished; however, after the January 1863 Uprising it disappeared. The last namestnik was Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg, who served from 1863 to his death in 1874. No namestnik was named to replace him;—or, to be more specific, of the Warsaw Military District (, ). The governor-general answered directly to the Emperor and exercised much broader powers than had the namestnik. In particular, he controlled all the military forces in the region and oversaw the judicial systems (he could impose death sentences without trial). He could also issue ""declarations with the force of law,"" which could alter existing laws. Administrative Council. The ""Administrative Council"" () was a part of Council of State of the Kingdom. Introduced by the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815, it was composed of 5 ministers, special nominees of the King and the Viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland. The Council executed the King's will and ruled in the cases outside the ministers competence and prepared projects for the Council of State. Administrative divisions. The administrative divisions of the Kingdom changed several times over its history. Over the next several decades, various smaller reforms were carried out, either changing the smaller administrative units or merging/splitting various subdivisions. Immediately after its creation in 1815–1816, the Kingdom of Poland was divided into departments, a relic from the times of the French-dominated Duchy of Warsaw. On January 16, 1816 the administrative division was reformed from the departments of the Duchy of Warsaw into the more traditionally Polish voivodeships, obwóds and powiats. There were 8 voivodeships. On 7 March 1837, in the aftermath of the November Uprising earlier that decade, the administrative division was reformed once again, bringing Congress Poland closer to the structure of the Russian Empire, with the introduction of guberniyas (governorate, Polish spelling ""gubernia""). In 1842 powiats were renamed okręgs, and obwóds were renamed powiats. In 1844 several governorates were merged with others, and some others renamed. 5 governorates remained. The 1867 reform, initiated after the failure of the January Uprising, was designed to tie the Congress Kingdom (now ""de facto"" the Vistulan Country) more tightly to the administration structure of the Russian Empire. It divided larger governorates into smaller ones. A new lower level entity, gmina, was introduced. The existing 5 governorates were restructured into 10. The 1912 reform created a new governorate - Kholm Governorate - from parts of the Sedlets and Lublin Governorates. It was split off from the Vistulan Country and made part of the Southwestern Krai of the Russian Empire. Notes. a Sources agree that after the fall of the January Uprising in 1864, the autonomy of Congress Poland was drastically reduced. They are however contradictory on whether Kingdom of Poland, colloquially known as Congress Poland, as a state, was officially replaced by the Vistula Land (""Privislinsky Krai""), a province of the Russian Empire, as many sources still use the term Congress Poland for the post-1864 period. The sources are also unclear as to when did the Congress Poland (or Vistula land) officially end; some arguing it ended when the German and Austro-Hungarian occupying authorities assumed control; others, that it ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Poland in 1916; finally, some argue that it occurred only with the creation of the independent Republic of Poland in 1918. Examples: "
wikipedia-375595," Concordant coastline  A concordant, longitudinal, or Pacific type coastline occurs where beds, or layers, of differing rock types are folded into ridges that run parallel to the coast. The outer hard rock (for example, granite) provides a protective barrier to erosion of the softer rocks (for example, clays) further inland. Sometimes the outer hard rock is punctured, allowing the sea to erode the softer rocks behind. This creates a cove, a circular area of water with a relatively narrow entrance from the sea. Lulworth Cove in Dorset is situated on a concordant coastline. The outer hard rock is Portland limestone. The sea has broken through this barrier and easily eroded the clays behind it. A chalk cliff face at the back of the cove slows further erosion. Erosion is just starting to the west, where the sea has again broken through the Portland limestone barrier at Stair Hole. The concordant coast may take one of two landform types. The Dalmatian type, named from Dalmatia on the Adriatic Sea, features long offshore islands and coastal inlets that are parallel to the coastline. The Adriatic Sea itself is a concordant landform, consisting of a body of water between parallel ranges. The second landform is the Haff type as in the Haffs, or lagoons, of the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, which are enclosed by long spits of sand parallel to the low coast. The converse of concordant coastline is a discordant coastline. "
wikipedia-375616," Penn Masala  Penn Masala is the world's first and premier Hindi a cappella group. Formed in 1996 by students at the University of Pennsylvania. Penn Masala’s music has been influenced by the Eastern and Western cultures that represent the group’s membership. The group was featured on the soundtrack of American Desi, and has released eight full-length albums: ""Awaaz"", ""11 PM"", ""Soundcheck"", ""The Brown Album"", ""Pehchaan"", ""On Detours"", ""Panoramic"", ""Kaavish"", and the compilation album ""Out of Stock"". History. Penn Masala, often stylized as pennmasala, was formed in 1996 by students at the University of Pennsylvania, who wanted to represent their subcontinental heritage and music through a cappella. Among other, more long-standing a cappella groups, Penn Masala stood out as the only a cappella group in the world that sang Hindi music. This defining characteristic of the group brought it immediate attention as members fused Hindi and English music in original song formats. Soon, the group began to bill itself as ""The world's first and premier Hindi a cappella group"". Within just four years of its inception, Penn Masala had gained close to 15 members. By 2002, the group released its first two CDs: ""Awaaz"" (Hindi for ""sound"") was released in 1999, and ""11 PM"" was released in 2001. Over the next 3 years, Penn Masala released two more full-length albums, ""Soundcheck"" and ""The Brown Album"", and a compilation CD entitled ""Out of Stock"", which included favorites from the first 3 albums. In 2007, the group released its fifth studio album, ""Pehchaan"" (Hindi for ""identity""). The group followed up the success of ""Pehchaan"" with their sixth album, ""On Detours,"" which was released in March 2009 and ""Panoramic"", released in 2011. In 2013, they released their eighth studio album titled ""Kaavish"", which features hit single ""Fix You/Ishq Bina"". Performances. Penn Masala performs around the world, with much of their traveling done in the United States; the group performs at numerous universities and events across the world, spanning cities from Kolkata to London to Montreal and San Francisco. In 1998, soon after the release of ""Awaaz"", Penn Masala went on its first international tour to the United Kingdom, hitting the airwaves and performing all across the United Kingdom. The group gave two particularly noteworthy concerts in New York City: once in 2000 at the Zee Gold Bollywood Awards in the Nassau Coliseum, and again in 2002 at the Bollywood Music Awards in the Hammerstein Ballroom. India tours. The group has traveled to India four times. In 2002, the group traveled to Mumbai, India to perform at the Star Screen Awards, during which time the members appeared on MTV Asia. In 2006, the group celebrated its 10th anniversary with a tour of India. The men performed at such venues as the National Centre for the Performing Arts at Nariman Point in Mumbai and Swabhumi in Kolkata. In January 2010, the group did another tour across India, selling out the Hard Rock Cafes in New Delhi and Mumbai. Penn Masala also performed at the Oberoi Trident at a ceremony honoring the achievements of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani. Present were many notable personalities, including Nita Ambani, director Rajkumar Hirani, director/producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah, actors Imran Khan, Rahul Bose and Vinod Khanna, and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar among others. The group also performed at the well-known Lumbini Park Amphitheatre in Hyderabad, and were featured in numerous media outlets, including NDTV, CNBC TV 18, BBC Asia, The Hindustan Times, Zee TV, and CNN-IBN among others. Penn Masala's 4th India tour took place in January 2013, where they shot a music video of Fix You / Ishq Bina and performed in 5 cities across all of the Hard Rock Cafes in the entire country. The January 2013 tour was covered by many major India new outlets, including the Times of India and DNA India, who met with members to write about the tour. United Kingdom and Canada tours. After its initial United Kingdom tour, Penn Masala continued reaching out to audiences abroad with a tour of the nation in March 2010. Among others, two notable performances were at St. James Piccadilly in central London, and in Hammersmith, where the group headlined a nationwide music competition. In November 2010 Penn Masala performed in Montreal, their first Canadian performance in ten years. Then again in 2011, Penn Masala toured the United Kingdom and did a show for The Rajasthani Foundation's Diwali Charity Gala Ball. Audience members included the Hinduja Brothers of the Hinduja Group, Lakshmi Narayan Mittal, Europe's richest man and CEO of ArcelorMittal, as well as the company's CFO Aditya Mittal. Domestic tours. Every semester, Penn Masala tours at a few university campuses. For example in 2011, Penn Masala performed full-length shows at University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University, University of Ohio, University of Houston, Rutgers University, Philadelphia Museum of Art University of North Carolina, University of Maryland and a second performance at Rutgers University, as well as an international gig in the United Kingdom. The group has scheduled its next performance at Southern Methodist University for Bhangra Blitz in April 2013. However on top of these routine performances, Penn Masala also has had the honor to perform for a number of famous individuals ranging from Anderson Cooper to Henry Kissinger to Ban Ki-Moon. On October 14, 2009, Penn Masala performed at the White House in Washington, D.C. for the White House's celebration of Diwali and the signing ceremony of the Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The event took place in the East Room, with attendees including President Barack Obama, the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Education, Associate Director of Public Engagement Kalpen Modi (also known as Kal Penn), members of Congress, and distinguished community members. Penn Masala opened the ceremony with a performance which was followed by a speech by President Obama, who commended their creative energy and contributions to the Asian American community. In fact in 2012, it was leaked that along with artists such as Jay-Z, Adam Levine, Fergie, Arcade Fire and others, Penn Masala was to be courted by President Barack Obama's team in order to obtain their celebrity endorsement. In 2011, Penn Masala was invited to perform for the presidents of universities all over the world as well as UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. Penn Masala also holds a large annual spring concert at the University of Pennsylvania in the university's largest performance venue, Irvine Auditorium. The concert features a wide selection of their songs, and incorporates humor throughout the show using skits and videos that often parody or spoof popular culture. The end of the show is usually marked by a traditional gathering of Masala alumni and current members of the group on stage to commemorate the group and its extensive alumni network. Music. Penn Masala combines various musical traditions, including Hindi film music, pop, hip-hop, R&B, rock, and Indian Classical styles. The group also uses a wide array of languages in their songs. Their compositions are primarily sung in English or Hindi, but certain songs include Arabic, Punjabi, Kannada, and Tamil as well. Penn Masala blends popular songs to create its own independent version, which is melodically and thematically unified. Most songs fuse popular Hindi and English songs (in the past the group has covered songs by artists such as U2 and Justin Timberlake), into an a cappella rendition. Some songs are purely Hindi; for example, ""Bahara"" on ""Panoramic"", and ""Yeh Honsla"" on ""On Detours"" and others purely English, such as ""What Goes Around Comes Around"" on ""On Detours"". Other songs, such as ""Aicha"" and ""Is Pal Mein"", incorporate Hindi and English lyrics into a single song. ""Aankhon Mein Tu Hai"" also includes Tamil verses, ""Saade Dil Te"" incorporates a Punjabi song, while ""Masala Dosa"" begins with the Kannada hymn ""Krishna Ni Begane"", ""Aicha"" includes Arabic verses and ""Fix You - Ishq Bina"" includes Bengali. While most of the group's songs are interpretations of already-existing songs, the group also composes originals, such as ""Main Tanha"" and ""Pehchaan"" on the album ""Pehchaan"", ""Kal Ka Sapna"" and ""Distant Places"" on ""On Detours"", ""Is Pal Mein"" and ""Kaash"" on ""Panoramic"", and ""Mann Mein Ujaala"" on ""Kaavish"". Penn Masala's music has been popularly and critically acclaimed. ""Meri Sapno Ki Rani"" and ""Aap Jaise Koi"" were both featured in American Desi, while a music video for ""Chamak Challo"" debuted in the Top 10 on ] India. Both ""Chamak Challo"" and ""Bharat Humko Jaan Se Pyara Hai"", a celebration of India's 50th anniversary of independence, brought immediate attention to the group in the fall of 1997, and have been fan favorites ever since. Penn Masala songs have been routinely selected for Varsity Vocals' ""Best of Collegiate A Cappella"" CD. ""Bharat Humko Jaan Se Pyara Hai"" was the first Penn Masala song to be honored. After that, "" ""Pehchaan"" from ""Pehchaan"", ""Lovestoned/Ya Ali"" from ""On Detours"" and ""Is Pal Mein"" from ""Panoramic"" have all been selected to be on the Best of Collegiate A Cappella CD for their respective years. In 2012, the group was named one of the 5 best college a cappella groups in the United States by USA Today and online magazine Her Campus. Members. Penn Masala is a living, evolving group. Made up of University of Pennsylvania students, the group's membership constantly changes as veteran members graduate and new members enter the group through an audition process. Penn Masala currently consists of: Varshil Patel, Akiff Premjee, Rohan Murthy, Dilip Rajan, Ashwin Muthiah, Anil Chitrapu, Prashant Ramesh and Chetan Khanna. "
wikipedia-375618," Chloroplast membrane  Chloroplasts contain several important membranes, vital for their function. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have a double-membrane envelope, called the chloroplast envelope, but unlike mitochondria, chloroplasts also have internal membrane structures called thylakoids. Furthermore, one or two additional membranes may enclose chloroplasts in organisms that underwent secondary endosymbiosis, such as the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes. The origin of chloroplasts is now largely accepted by the botany community as occurring via endosymbiosis on an ancestral basis with the engulfment of photosynthetic bacterium within the eukaryotic cell. Over millions of years the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium evolved structurally and functionally, retaining its own DNA and the ability to divide by binary fission (not mitotically) but giving up its autonomy by the transfer of some of its genes to the nuclear genome. Envelope membranes. Each of the envelope membranes is a lipid bilayer that is between 6 and 8 nm thick. The lipid composition of the outer membrane has been found to be 48% phospholipids, 46% galactolipids and 6% sulfolipids, while the inner membrane has been found to contain 16% phospholipids, 79% galactolipids and 5% sulfolipids in spinach chloroplasts. The outer membrane is permeable to most ions and metabolites, but the inner membrane is highly specialised with transport proteins. For example, carbohydrates are transported across the inner envelope membrane by a triose phosphate translocator. The two envelope membranes are separated by a gap of 10-20 nm, called the intermembrane space. Thylakoid membrane. Within the envelope membranes, in the region called the stroma, there is a system of interconnecting flattened membrane compartments, called the thylakoids. The thylakoid membrane is quite similar in lipid composition to the inner envelope membrane, containing 78% galactolipids, 15.5% phospholipids and 6.5% sulfolipids in spinach chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane encloses a single, continuous aqueous compartment called the thylakoid lumen. These are the sites of light absorption and ATP synthesis, and contain many proteins, including those involved in the electron transport chain. Photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls a,b and c some others e.g. xanthophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins are also embedded within the granum membrane. With exception of chlorophyll a, all the other associated pigments are ""accessory"" and transfer energy to the reaction centers, Photosytems I and II. The membranes of the thylakoid contain photosystems I and II which harvest solar energy to excite electrons which travel down the electron transport chain. This exergonic fall in potential energy along the way is used to draw (not pump!) H+ ions from the lumen of the thylakoid into the cytosol of a cyanobacterium or the stroma of a chloroplast. A steep H+ gradient is formed, which allows chemiosmosis to occur, where the thylakoid, transmenbrane ATP-synthase serves a dual function as a ""gate"" or channel for H+ ions and a catalytic site for the formation of ATP from ADP + a P0-4 ion. Experiments have shown that the pH within the stroma is about 7.8, while that of the lumen of the thylakoid is 5. This corresponds to a six-hundredfold difference in concentration of H+ ions. The H+ ions pass down through the ATP-synthase catalytic gate. This chemiosmotic phenomenon occurs in mitochondria. "
wikipedia-375623," Netherlands Public Broadcasting  Netherlands Public Broadcasting, Dutch: ""Nederlandse Publieke Omroep"" (abbr. ""NPO""), is the name used in the Netherlands to refer to the country's public-service broadcasting system as a whole; it is used, for instance, as the name of the joint web portal coordinated by the NPO on behalf of all the broadcasting associations. Public-service broadcasting in the Netherlands is provided jointly by a number of broadcasting organizations under the tutelage of NPO. Since September 2002, the Dutch membership of the European Broadcasting Union is held by Netherlands Public Broadcasting (since March 15, 2007 renamed ""Nederlandse Publieke Omroep""). The Netherlands Radio Union ""(Nederlandse Radio Unie)"" was one of 23 founding organisations of the EBU. Overview. Unlike most other countries' public broadcasting organizations – which are either national corporations (such as the BBC and France Télévisions / Radio France), federations of regional public-law bodies (for example, ARD, SRG SSR idée suisse), or governmental and member-based institutions with their own channels and facilities (such as PBS) – those in the Netherlands are member-based broadcasting associations that share common facilities. This arrangement has its origins in the system developed in the Netherlands early in the 20th century and known as ""pillarisation"". Under this system the different confessional and political streams of Dutch society (Catholics, Protestants, socialists, etc.) all had their own separate associations, newspapers, sports clubs, educational institutions, and also broadcasting organizations. The stated aim is to give a voice to each social group in the multicultural diversity that is Dutch society. The number of hours allocated to each broadcaster corresponds, roughly, to the number of members each organization is able to recruit (although this does not apply to NOS and NTR – see below). Since 2000, the system has been financed out of general taxation rather than from broadcast receiver licence fees. This is supplemented by a limited amount of on-air advertising, which has been allowed since 1967. Nearly all viewers in the Netherlands receive most of their TV via cable or satellite systems. Regional public TV exists in parallel to the national system described below. Commercial television in the Netherlands began in 1989, with the Luxembourg-based RTL 4. In 1992, the government of the Netherlands officially legalised commercial TV, and many new commercial channels have become established since then. Role. The role of Netherlands Public Broadcasting can be defined as such: Through its own Management Board, Netherlands Public Broadcasting acts as a figurehead to current and aspiring broadcasting associations, the public broadcasters NOS and NTR and minority and religious associations. Finance. Every year, the Dutch public broadcasting system is allocated funds from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. In 2008 the allocation was 738 million Euro with revenues in 2009 from advertising totalling 196 million Euro. The cost to each Dutch citizen is approximately 116 Euro per year, which is much less compared to the BBC in the United Kingdom (158 Euro, approx. 142 GBP), but more compared to VRT in Flemish Belgium (49 Euro). History. The closed system (1920–1960). Public broadcasting in the Netherlands has been since the very beginning in the early 1920s split up into different broadcasting associations with its members composed of listeners and viewers. These associations were based on the different ideological sections of Dutch society, called ""Verzuiling"" (pillarisation). Catholics, Protestants and Socialists were the first groups to create their own sections of society, including their own schools, hospitals, unions and political parties. When radio in the Netherlands started in the 1920s the existing groups quickly created their own broadcasting associations, producing programmes for the primary radio network, Hilversum 1. The first to start was the liberal AVRO, built around the commercial broadcaster HDO founded by the NSF transmitter factory in Huizen. Programs started July 21 1923. Airtime was rented to the several religious and political radio organisations--the Protestant NCRV, the Roman Catholic KRO, the Socialist VARA and the liberal Protestant VPRO. Each group was faithful to its broadcasting company. For example, it was considered unthinkable for a Protestant to listen to KRO programming. The programmes were funded by the associations' members. KRO and NCRV started their own station in 1927 with a transmitter also placed in Huizen and built by the NSF. In 1930 the government regulated equal airtime for all organisations on the two stations and the semi-public broadcasting system was born. As a result, AVRO lost most of its airtime then (50%) to VARA and VPRO. The radio licence fee was introduced by the Nazi occupation during World War II; the different broadcasting groups were urged by the Government for more co-operation between each other, and the Netherlands Radio Union (Dutch:""Nederlandse Radio Unie"") was formed, producing joint programmes.  1951 saw the introduction of television and a similar joint union was founded: the Netherlands Television Foundation (""Nederlandse Televisie Stichting""), supplying studios and facilities for the associations. These broadcasts would air on a channel, called Nederland 1 with a second channel, Nederland 2 launching in 1964. The closed system opens up (1960–1990). With the arrival of illegal offshore commercial radio stations, such as Radio Veronica in 1960 and Radio Nordzee in 1964, Hilversum 3 launched in 1965 to provide a legal alternative and to steer audiences towards the public service channels. Hilversum 3 was renamed, along with the other two networks to Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 3 towards the late 1980s. In 1967 a Broadcasting Act was passed into law, providing an official framework to supply the public with information, entertainment, culture and education, with time allocated to appointed broadcasting associations based on the number of members each association had. It also allowed: A new Media Act in 1988 meant that broadcasters no longer were obligated to use production facilities supplied by the NOS. These facilities were spun-off into a new private company. Programme quotas were introduced, which meant associations must produce: A new media regulator (Commissariaat voor de Media) was created to regulate the public and private networks with the ability to impose fines, with a programming fund designed to encourage cultural broadcasts. New rules for the cable industry were also stipulated which meant the public networks were designated must-carry status. The appearance of private media (1990–2000). A third television network, Nederland 3 launched in April 1988, in anticipation of the launch of new commercial channels broadcast by satellite. Luxembourg-based RTL-Véronique began broadcasting in October 1989. In 1992, the government of the Netherlands officially legalised commercial TV, and many new commercial channels have become established since then with the result of market share for public television falling from 85% to 50% by 1994. Veronica, after 20 years, decided to leave the public system to become a commercial broadcaster. Further private channels from RTL and SBS reduced market shares for the public networks further 40% in 1996. With the change in the television landscape, changes were made to strengthen the public sector. Its financial revenues were improved with an increase in advertising minutage and the licence fee indexed to the cost of living. In 1995 the programming duties of the Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation (NOS) were split in two, with the creation of the NPS (""Netherlands Programming Foundation""). NOS were now charged with providing news, sport and coverage of important live events while the NPS provided cultural and children's programming. The previous NOS management was replaced with a three-man board, now charged with developing strategies and responsibility for all public output. Programming co-ordinators were appointed for each television and radio network and channel identities were created, largely replacing the varying on-air presentation of the pillar broadcasters. The broadcasting associations also have a degree of input through a Supervisory Board. Market share for the public networks stabilized in 1999 at 38%, with the entry of a new broadcasting association, the first in 25 years. BNN (""Bart's News Network"", later ""Bart's Neverending Network"") replaced Veronica as programme supplier to teenagers and young adults. Diversification and expansion (2000 - 2010). Since the ""open system"" any company can become a broadcasting company and get radio and TV airtime. The only thing required is to request an official status from the government and to have enough members. Broadcast companies in the Netherlands still have to make sure every year they have enough members to keep their official status, and most of them sell TV-guides or other magazines and make every subscriber a member of their organization. Many people question if the current system is still applicable in this age of digital broadcasting. There were plans leading up to the 2002 general election to change the way broadcast companies are selected, and completely abolish the member-based system. Vocal critics included Pim Fortuyn, the assassinated leader of his own right-wing party. However, currently the system is still the way it always has been, and a new system will probably only make its appearance in several years. From September 2010, new broadcasting associations PowNed and Wakker Nederland (WNL) were approved to enter the public broadcasting system by the Minister of Culture and Education Ronald Plasterk. Another association, MAX was given full recognition and can increase its broadcasting hours, conversely, LLiNK was withdrawn and no longer has access. Meanwhile, the NPS, Teleac and the RVU institutions merged into one public broadcaster, the NTR, delivering cultural, educational, current affairs and children's programmes to the public system. Cuts to the public system (2010 - present). On January 18, 2010, Henk Hagoort, chairman of the NPO Management Board, announced a scaling back of the amount of broadcasting associations using the public airwaves to 15 by 2015. He also warned of the threat of political parties which could influence programming in the public broadcasting system. In September 2010 cuts to the public system took effect, with the existing eleven full-time broadcasting associations facing decisions about its future. Part-time Islamic broadcasters NMO, NIO and the merged SMON were all withdrawn from the public system. In March 2012, NPO announced the closure of two of its digital television channels. Geschiedenis 24 (""History 24"") and Consumenten 24 (""Consumer 24"") closed on 1 April, with history programmes transferred to Holland Doc 24 and consumer programmes looked after by VARA via an online portal Future plans (from 2016). From 2015, Netherlands Public Broadcasting will face a budget shortfall of 200 million euro. To address this, the number of broadcasting associations within the public system is to be reduced. Mergers have been confirmed between existing broadcasting associations: List of broadcasters. Member based. There are currently twelve member-based broadcasting associations: Task based. In addition, there are now two official ""public service broadcasters"" created under the Media Act of 1988: Other. Apart from the member and task based broadcasters, a small amount of airtime is given to smaller organizations, which represent religions, have educational programs, or received airtime for other reasons. None of these organizations have any members. Television. The broadcasting organisations produce programmes for the three main television channels and the twelve digital channels, available through Nederland 24. As of 4 July 2009 the three main channels are simulcasted in 1080i high-definition. Most programming in the early stages is upscaled as in time more programs will become available in native HD. From June 2 until August 24, 2008 a temporary high-definition version of the Nederland 1 channel was made available to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD before launch of the permanent HD service.

wikipedia-375627," Peter Sissons  Peter George Sissons (born 17 July 1942) is a broadcast journalist in the United Kingdom. He was the presenter of the BBC Nine O'Clock News and the BBC News at Ten between 1993 and 2003, and earlier a newscaster for ITN, providing bulletins on ITV and Channel 4. He is also a former presenter of the BBC's ""Question Time"" programme. He left the BBC in 2009. Background. Originally from Liverpool, Peter Sissons attended the Dovedale Road Junior School with John Lennon and Jimmy Tarbuck and after the 11+ to the Liverpool Institute for Boys from 1953 to 1961 with Bill Kenwright, Stephen Norris, George Harrison and Paul McCartney. He later studied at University College, Oxford where he was Treasurer of the University College Players. Career. After many years as a journalist, during which time he was wounded by gunfire while covering the Biafran War, his first period as a newsreader came in 1976 when he began anchoring ITN's """" bulletins alternately with Leonard Parkin until the first incarnation of the series was dropped by ITV in 1987 after Leonard Parkin decided to retire from ITN; Sissons subsequently left for the BBC. In June 1989, Sissons took over from Sir Robin Day as the presenter of ""Question Time"". He continued until December 1993, when he was followed by David Dimbleby. In the same year he received a death threat, after his interview of an Iranian representative as part of the reaction surrounding the publication of ""The Satanic Verses"", stating that the fatwa covered him as well. He co-presented BBC's 1992 General Election Night coverage with David Dimbleby and Peter Snow. Previously he had been a co-presenter on ITN's election night programmes in 1983 (with Sir Alastair Burnet and Martyn Lewis) and in 1987 (with Burnet and Alastair Stewart). He has worked for ITN, Channel 4 News and BBC News, where he hosted the ""BBC Nine O'Clock News"" and the ""Ten O'Clock News"". He was dropped from this position in January 2003. Sissons reportedly accused the BBC of ageism in response to its decision to move him from the prime slot. In 2002, Sissons announced the death of The Queen Mother on the BBC. This broadcast created a major controversy, as he wore a burgundy tie as opposed to a black one, deemed more appropriate by tradition for such news. Sissons has since publicly defended his actions. Also during the broadcast he carried out a live on air interview with the Hon. Margaret Rhodes, the Queen Mother's niece, in which he pressed her for intimate details of the final moments of the death to the point of her breaking off the interview. This interview caused a media furore at the time, consternation in the Royal Family's circle and led the Prince of Wales to choose ITN to record his personal televisual appreciation of his grandmother rather than the BBC which would have been the expected and traditional option.  Sissons' reputation as a broadcaster was damaged by the affair. He subsequently presented weekend afternoons on BBC News, the corporation's 24-hour rolling news channel. Sissons has also presented ""News 24 Sunday"", the replacement for Andrew Marr's BBC One programme ""The Andrew Marr Show"" when it is off air during the Summer. He also occasionally presented weekend bulletins on BBC One. On 12 June 2009, Sissons announced his intention to retire in the summer in order to write his memoirs. Other appearances. Sissons portrayed a spoof version of himself in ""The Life of Python"", a lighthearted documentary about the ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" television show, in which he led an interview of the five surviving Pythons together, which consisted entirely of them all saying ""Hello"". Opinions. In 2011, Sissons published ""When One Door Closes"" (from which an extract was reproduced for Mail Online), in which he claimed that BBC News had a bias towards the political Left and complained that ""The Guardian"" was the first newspaper that was turned to for a lead on stories. Personal life. Sissons is also a Liverpool John Moores University Honorary Fellow and delivered a lecture on 19 June 2008 speaking about the City of Liverpool. His daughter is the actress Kate Sissons. Sissons lives in Kent with his wife Sylvia, and also has a second home on the island of Barbados. "

wikipedia-375646," Black Country Living Museum  The Black Country Living Museum (formerly The Black Country Museum) is an open-air museum of rebuilt historic buildings in Dudley in the West Midlands of England. It is close to Dudley Castle in the centre of the Black Country conurbation. The museum occupies of former industrial land partly reclaimed from a former railway goods yard, disused lime kilns and former coal pits. It was opened in 1978, since when many more exhibits have been added. The museum preserves some important buildings from around the Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall and the City of Wolverhampton; mainly in a specially built village. Most buildings were relocated from their original sites to form a base from where demonstrators portray life in the period from the 1850s to the 1950s. The museum is constantly changing as new exhibits, especially buildings, are being added. Background. The museum is close to the site where Thomas Dudley first mastered the technique of smelting iron with coal instead of wood charcoal and making iron enough for industrial use. Having a claim to be ""the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution"", the Black Country is famous for its wide range of steel-based products from nails to the anchor and anchor chain for the Titanic.  The site's coal mining heritage is shown by an underground drift and colliery surface buildings. The museum has a working replica of a Newcomen atmospheric engine. Thomas Newcomen's invention was first successfully put to use in Tipton in 1712. The museum's reconstruction was based on a print engraved by Thomas Barney, filemaker of Wolverhampton, in 1719. Electric trams and trolleybuses transport visitors from the entrance to the village where thirty domestic and industrial buildings have been relocated close to the canal basin. The museum is one of three in the UK with working trolleybuses. The route to the village passes the Cast Iron Houses and a 1930s fairground. A narrowboat operated by Dudley Canal Trust makes trips on the Dudley Canal and into the Dudley Tunnel. On 16 February 2012, the museum's collection was awarded designated status by Arts Council England (ACE), a mark of distinction celebrating its unique national and international importance. Exhibitions. By the main entrance in the old Rolfe Street Baths are displays of local artefacts encompassing some of the many products which were made by Black Country industry, cast iron hollow ware, animal traps, vehicles, chain, anchors, enamels, weighing scales, laundry irons, nails, locks and fireclay products. The exhibition includes more fragile items such as glassware, reflecting the centuries old industry that produced lead crystal glass and the Joseph Chance glass works between Oldbury and Smethwick. Mining and lime kilns. The museum site contained 42 disused mine shafts, most of which had been filled in. Two are preserved, one at the Racecourse Colliery and Brook Shaft. In 1712, Thomas Newcomen built the world's first successful steam engine which was used for pumping water from coal mines on Lord Dudley's estates. In 1986, after ten years of research, the museum completed the construction of a full-scale working replica of the engine. The 'fire engine' is housed in a brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine has a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above it. The cylinder is more than two metres long and 52 centimetres in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down causing the pump to move. Lime working and processing was carried out on the site from medieval times. Evidence of quarries and underground remains, the canal, and preserved lime kilns are parts of a scheduled ancient monument which has features from the medieval, Industrial Revolution and 20th century. Standing alongside canal arm are the lime kilns, built by the Earl of Dudley to process limestone quarried from Wren's Nest workings. The earliest of the three surviving kilns dates from the late 18th century. Metal working. The trap shop was built in 1913 in Rookery Street, Wednesfield. It was offered to the museum in 1982. Sidebotham's Steel Trap Works was not rebuilt in its entirety and the original structure was shortened. The exhibit, set around 1930, contains the office, trap shop and the machine shop. The nail shop is a replica of a back-yard workshop, built in the 1880s from 17 Chapel Street, Halesowen. It houses equipment from the Halesowen workshop operated by Sidney Tether in the 1940s. It is in use on a regular basis by the resident nail maker who demonstrates the skill of forging nails by hand. The brass foundry was built in 1869 in Shaw Street, Walsall and closed after the Second World War but re-opened in 1964 by James Powell and used until his death in 1973. The building and its equipment were relocated to the museum in 1986. It can be seen in operation when the brass caster demonstrates traditional skills in casting horse brasses, pot hooks and other small items. The rolling mill installed at the Birchley Works in Oldbury in 1923 ceased to operate in 1976 and it was moved to Lord Ward's Canal Arm. The museum operates the it from time to time using volunteers. The chain maker's shop represents one of the many workshops that made small and medium size chain. By the mid-1800s the chain industry was mostly associated with Cradley, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Quarry Bank and Netherton. It is operational and the skill of making chain by hand can be watched daily. An Oliver hammer was a treadle-operated hammer that forged bolts by forcing red hot lengths of iron into a die. The machine shop contained several Oliver hammers used to forge special parts to order. It was founded by Onan Lowe and taken over by T. W. Lench Ltd. Village. On the low ground at the northern end of the site, houses, shops, workshops and public buildings have been dismantled and rebuilt brick by brick to create an early 20th-century village. Activities in the buildings are demonstrated by staff in period costume. The village preserves a cross section of social and industrial history.  The village shops include Gregory's General Store, Emile Doo's chemist shop, a sweet shop and cake shop with a bakery at the back. There is a hardware and ironmongers shop from Pipers Row in Wolverhampton.and a pawnbroker's shop that was relocated to the museum in 1991. Brook Street back to back houses, built in the 1850s, were relocated from Woodsetton and were the homes of colliers, farm workers and ironworkers. The anchor maker's house from Lawrence Lane in Old Hill was the first to be relocated to the museum and is an example of late-Victorian housing. Public buildings include Providence Chapel from Darby End/Hand near Netherton, one of the first buildings to be rebuilt, and the Bottle and Glass Inn a working public house set out as it would have been in 1910.  The village postbox stood on the corner of Baker Street and Blandford Street, London in 1865. It was and designed by architect J W Penfold and made by Cochrane, Grove and Company.  The Carter's Yard from Ogley Hay Road Burntwood, Cannock was built around 1900. It was dismantled and brought to the museum in the 1990s. 1930s Street (Old Birmingham Road). Old Birmingham Road links St James’s School with the Cradley Heath Workers' Institute. Here buildings have been set in the 1930s to tell the story of the years leading up to the Second World War. Museum staff in St James's School demonstrate lessons and school life from the turn of the 20th century. The school building opened in Eve Hill, Dudley in 1842 for pupils aged 5–11. It was decided to transfer the building to the museum in 1989 and relocation was completed by October 1990, with the exhibit opening the following year. Hobbs & Sons fish and chip shop and H Morrall’s gentlemen's outfitters have been returned to 1935 condition. The shops come from Hall Street, Dudley and date from the late-18th century and refaced with bright red pressed brickwork in 1889. The tiled interior of Hobbs features restored hand-painted tiled wall panels. The frying range is of a design patented in 1932 made by E.W. Proctor of Huddersfield. In the 1930s many of Joseph Hobbs’s customers worked in factories or shops.  Four buildings were rescued from Birmingham Street, Oldbury and date to about 1860. The block is dominated by the green painted fascia of Humphrey Brothers, builders’ merchants, who occupied the premises from 1921. It has a replica shop front from about about 1932. Humphreys sold fireplaces, sanitaryware and building supplies including Walpamur,®, a flat paint used for internal walls. The motorcycle shop is based on the business of A. Hartill & Sons which was located in Mount Pleasant, Bilston. The window displays of locally made six motor bikes from 1929-34. Next door is Alfred Preedy & Sons tobacconist shop, established in Dudley in 1868. James Gripton's radio shop is from the 1920s and this reconstruction, set in 1939, contains ‘new’ and second radios.  The brick tunnel and cart entrance provide access to a late 1930s kitchen with an electric cooker made by Revo of Tipton. There is a radio workshop behind Gripton's and then the stairs lead to two first floor living rooms and two bedrooms which are all set in the late 1930s and furnished with original 1930s style furniture and wall paper. The Cradley Heath Workers' Institute was built with surplus funds raised in 1910 during the strike for a minimum wage by women chain makers. The Arts and Crafts style building was designed by architect, Albert Thomas Butler, and opened on 10 June 1912. It became a centre for educational meetings, social gatherings and trade union activities in Cradley Heath. Re-erected at the museum it is a monument to Mary Macarthur and her campaign to establish a national minimum wage in the ""sweated trades"" where people worked long hours for poverty wages typically in appalling conditions. The building contains reconstructed offices, a news room with a digital interpretation of the background to the strike and a large hall which is used for a wide range of activities including theatre performances and concerts. 1930s fairground. The 1930s fairground located behind the school represents a travelling fairground that would have brought entertainment to people in the early 1900s. Such fairs set up on waste ground and for a few days provided thrills, entertainment and a change for those who might never go on holiday. The collection of historic rides includes a helter skelter and the Ark, the latest thing in high-speed rides when introduced in the 1920s. It was updated over the years but not converted into a waltzer. It remains one of the few 'fourlift' Arks in the country. Lord Ward’s Canal Arm. Work began on the boat dock in 1976 and the museum aimed to recreate a typical dock that would have been found on the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN). Docks like the one at the museum would have been formed from recycled wooden boats. They were used to build wooden boats or maintain iron and composite boats. Adjacent to the museum is the Dudley Tunnel. Visitors can take a trip into the tunnel to Wren's Nest, a scheduled monument and view the remains of extensive limestone quarrying on a boat operated by the Dudley Canal Trust. Boat collection. The museum's boat display consists of boats that it owns, are on loan or have mooring agreements.  The museum owns: Other boats at the museum: Transport Collection. The size of the museum site provides the opportunity to demonstrate many of the road transport exhibits which were both used and made in the Black Country. Trolleybuses. The Black Country Living Museum operates a trolleybus service on certain days, unlike the tram which is usually operated seven days a week. The route is one of the few double deck trolley bus services left in the world, as most of the world's trolley buses are single deckers.  The museum's fleet numbers three resident trolleybuses from the Black Country's two former trolley bus networks, and there are also visiting trolleybuses, most of which had some sort of connection with the Black Country. Unlike Birmingham's tram service, Birmingham Corporation Trolley Buses never operated in the Black Country. The Resident Fleet is listed below; During January 2011 thieves broke in and stole part of both the tram and trolleybus overhead wires. As of August 2012 both the tram and trolley bus systems are back in operation. Motor Cars. Wolverhampton was home to some early manufacturers of motor cars, such as Sunbeam, Clyno, AJS and Star. Frisky cars were also made in Wolverhampton, while the Black Country town of Kingswinford is home to Westfield cars. The Museum collection includes a 1903 Sunbeam, a 1912 Star and a 1931 AJS as well as examples of later vehicles such as the Kieft, Frisky and Westfield Topaz. Motor Cycles. There are approximately 40 motor cycles in the Museum's collection, all of which were made in the Black Country. A large proportion were manufactured by Sunbeam and AJS but there are also examples by firms such as Wearwell Cycle Company and Rockson. The Museum is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust. Other vehicles. The Museum does not have an extensive collection of Black Country bicycles, but there are examples by manufacturers such as Harry Albino and Star. Unusual vehicles in the fleet include a 1924 Guy-Morris fire engine, a Model T Ford van used by Willenhall firm Brevitt's and a Bean of Tipton flat bed truck. Other collections. In addition to the wide range of displayed collections, the Museum has extensive research collections held in store. These include historic objects, archival material and library books, all of which can be viewed by appointment. "
wikipedia-388782," Ospedale della Pietà  The Ospedale della Pietà was a convent, orphanage, and music school in Venice.  Like other Venetian ""ospedali"", the Pietà was established (in a location remote from the Riva degli Schiavoni) as a hotel for Crusaders. As the Crusades abated, it changed by degrees into a charitable institution for orphans and abandoned girls.  Infants could be left at the Pietà via the ""scaffetta"", a window only large enough to admit infants. Not all infants were female, nor were they necessarily orphans. Through the seventeenth century all of four of the surviving ""ospedali"" gained increasing attention through the performances of sacred music by their ""figlie di coro"". Formal rules for the training of ""figlie"" were carefully drafted and periodically revised. Many of these concerts were given for select audiences consisting of important visitors. (Princesses and countesses were more drawn to the special nature of the performances than were their husbands, brothers, or sons.)  As the institution became celebrated, it sometimes received infants related (not always legitimately) to members of the nobility. In the later decades of the Venetian Republic, which collapsed in 1797, it also accepted adolescent music students whose fees were paid by sponsoring foreign courts or dignitaries. The Pietà produced many virtuose and at least two composers--Anna Bon and Vincenta Da Ponte. The life of successful ""figlie"" was much coveted. Some were given lavish gifts by admirers, and many were offered periods of vacation in villas on the Italian mainland. Most remained their entire lives, though as the Venetian economy declined in the eighteenth century, some left to make (usually advantageous) marriages. In this instance, the institution provided a future bride with a small dowry.  Each Hospital had an orchestra of at least thirty to forty elements, all females (La Pietà's orchestra counted up to sixty) and competed with each other by hiring the best musicians in the city, promoting high quality concerts, and through such activities provided countless commissions for violin and other instruments makers to provide for the maintenance and repair of such instruments. These artisans were named ""liuter del loco"". The office of ""liuter del loco"" guaranteed a constant flow of income: curating the instruments of an entire orchestra was a burdensome activity which required the work of more than one person; instruments had to be picked up, continuously repaired because of breakage and ungluing from use, and sometimes instruments had to be built. The responsible violin maker also had to supply strings for the entire orchestra, keep an accounting book detailing all operations, and issue semi-annual or annual invoices.  These invoices, or ‘policies’ as they were called at the time, were handwritten by the appointed violin maker and had to be approved by the ""maestre del coro"" or the maestro di cappella – who would usually be granted a discount – before being paid by the hospital administration. These ‘policies’ are not only a precious source of information for the study of an author (luthier) and his work, but they are also a valid tool to gather more information on the musical practice of the ""sonadori"" (players) of the time. There is also much information that can be gleaned from their organological study. For a reading of some the most interesting invoices, we refer to the appendix of Pio book where some of them (the author has found and catalogued more than 110, totaling 400 pages) are listed in chronological order and cover the years from 1750 to 1810.  The composer Antonio Vivaldi was appointed a violin teacher in 1703 and served in various roles through 1715, and again from 1723 to 1740. Much of Vivaldi's sacred vocal and instrumental music was written for performance at the Pietà. The conservatory of the Pietà hospital was the only hospital to remain active until approximately 1830. All the other hospitals completely closed their musical activity during the first years of the nineteenth century. From an instrument inventory dated 1790 we learn that during that year the Pietà hospital had still “four violins with used bows, four cellos, seventeen violins, two marine trumpets, six small violas, two viola d’amore, two mandolines, two lutes, one theorbo, four hunting horns with accessories, two psalteries with harmonic box, two cymbals, three flutes, two big cymbals with spinets, six spinets. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's account of 1770 conveys his impressions but has been over-generalized as a description of the institution over an entire century. After describing how the performers were hidden behind metal grilles, he related in his ""Confessions"" (1770): I have not an idea of anything so voluptuous and affecting as this music; the richness of the art, the exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices, the justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts concurs to produce an impression which certainly is not the mode, but from which I am of opinion no heart is secure. He goes on to the musicians. The original building (shown above) is currently a hotel-restaurant complex (the Metropole). The nearby church of the Pietà was completed in 1761, two decades after the death of Antonio Vivaldi. The facade of the church was only completed in the early 20th century. An early childhood education center is still housed in the rear of the building complex behind the church. Most of this complex was donated to the Ospedale in the 1720s, enabling it to expand its activities. Some of Vivaldi's premiere pupils, such as Anna Maria del Violino, were given individual rooms in these newly acquired buildings. It is possible that in the salon of one of them the famous concert for """"i conti del Nord"""", celebrated in Guardi's painting [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1344001], took place on January 22, 1782. (Guardi's painting is mistitled is ""The Dinner and Ball in the Teatro San Benedetto""). "
wikipedia-388783," Lantana  Lantana is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated ""Viburnum lantana"". Lantana's aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.  ""Wild lantanas"" are plants of the unrelated genus ""Abronia"", usually called ""sand-verbenas"". Ecology. Some species are invasive, and are considered to be noxious weeds, such as in South Asia, Southern Africa and Australia. In the United States, lantanas are naturalized in the southeast, especially coastal regions of the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, and the Gulf Coast. The spread of lantana is aided by the characteristic of their leaves, which are somewhat poisonous to most animals, while their fruit is a delicacy for many birds which distribute the seeds. Birds like the Yellow-fronted White-eye of Vanuatu, the Superb Fairy-wren in Australia, the Scaly-breasted Munia, or the Mauritius Bulbul in the Mascarenes thus unwittingly contribute to the degradation of their home ecosystem. Biological control of introduced lantanas has been attempted, without robust success. In Australia, about 30 insects have been introduced in an attempt to control the spread of lantanas, and this has caused problems of its own. The Lantana Bug (""Aconophora compressa"") for example is a polyphagous species introduced in 1995 that feeds on dozens of plants, and not only has it failed to have a noticeable impact on the lantana population, it has even become a pest in horticulture, parasitizing the related fiddlewoods (""Citharexylum""). The small ""Lantana""-feeding moths ""Epinotia lantana"" and ""Lantanophaga pusillidactyla"", while not becoming pests, have nonetheless failed to stem the spread of the invasive weed, as has the Lantana Scrub-hairstreak butterfly (""Strymon bazochii"") which was introduced to control lantanas on the Hawaiian Islands. Other Lepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on ""Lantana"" species include the Common Splendid Ghost Moth (""Aenetus ligniveren""), ""Aenetus scotti"", ""Endoclita malabaricus"", ""Hypercompe orsa"" and the Setaceous Hebrew Character (""Xestia c-nigrum""). The Swamp Wallaby (""Wallabia bicolor"") is one of the few mammals that eat ""Lantana"" leaves without apparent ill effect. As a positive aspect, lantanas are useful as honey plants, and Spanish Flag (""L. camara""), ""L. lilacina"" and ""L. trifolia"" are sometimes planted for this purpose, or in butterfly gardening. Butterflies which are attracted to lantana flowers are most notably Papilioninae (swallowtail and birdwing butterflies). Hesperiidae (skippers) and certain brush-footed butterflies (namely Danainae and Heliconiinae), as well as some Pieridae (e.g. Cloudless Sulphur, ""Phoebis sennae"") and Lycaenidae (e.g. the aforementioned Lantana Scrub-hairstreak), also like to visit the plants' flowers. Consequently, as total eradication of ""Lantana"" seems often impossible, it may in many cases be better to simply remove plants with immature (green) fruit to prevent them from spreading. Some weaverbirds, e.g. the Black-throated Weaver (""Ploceus benghalensis"") and the Streaked Weaver (""P. manyar""), highly value ""Lantana"" flowers for decorating their nests. An ability to procure spectacular and innovative decorations appears to be desired by females, and consequently is an indicator of the males' fitness. ""Ceratobasidium cornigerum"" is a higher fungus which parasitizes ""Lantana"" among other plants. The Sweet Potato Whitefly (""Bemisia tabaci"") is a common greenhouse pest and is often distributed with infested lantanas. ""Lantana"" species, especially ""L. camara"", contain pentacyclic triterpenoids that cause hepatotoxicity and photosensitivity when ingested by grazing animals such as sheep, goats, bovines, and horses. This has led to widespread livestock loss in the United States, South Africa, India, Mexico, and Australia. Uses. ""Lantana"" species are widely cultivated for their flowers in tropical and subtropical environments and (as an annual plant) in temperate climates. Most of the plants sold as lantana are either Spanish Flag (species of section Lantana and their hybrids, including ""L. camara"", L. depressa, L. hirsuta, L. horrida, L. splendens, L. strigocamara, etc.), or Trailing Lantana (""L. montevidensis""). Numerous cultivars of the Spanish Flag exist, including 'Irene', 'Christine' and 'Dallas Red' (all tall-growing cultivars) and several recently introduced shorter ones. The shorter cultivars may flower more prolifically than the taller ones. ""L. montevidensis"" gives blue (or white) flowers all year round. Its foliage is dark green and has a distinct odor. Although lantanas are generally hardy and, being somewhat toxic, are usually rejected by herbivores, they may still become infested with pests. Lantana berries are edible when ripe though like many fruit are mildly poisonous if eaten while still green.  Extracts of ""Lantana camara"" may be used for protection of cabbage against the aphid ""Lipaphis erysimi"". "
wikipedia-388787," Worcester v. Georgia  Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court vacated the conviction of Samuel Worcester and held that the Georgia criminal statute that prohibited non-Native Americans from being present on Native American lands without a license from the state was unconstitutional. The opinion is most famous for its ""dicta"", which lay out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments, building the foundations of the doctrine of tribal sovereignty in the United States. Background. Facts. Georgia passed laws restricting authority of the Cherokees over their lands. Among these was a law requiring all whites living in Cherokee Indian Territory, including missionaries and persons married to Cherokee, to obtain a state license to live there. After seven missionaries refused to obtain licenses, they were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to four years of hard labor. They refused to obey the military when they were asked to leave the state. They appealed their case to the United States Supreme Court, arguing that the law under which they had been convicted was unconstitutional because states have no authority to pass laws concerning sovereign Indian Nations.  The missionaries Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler were arrested by Georgia because of their opposition to Cherokee removal. Even if they had applied for state licenses, they still would have been denied. The Georgia state courts had previously deferred to Worcester because of his federal appointment as postmaster to New Echota, the Cherokee capital. However, George Rockingham Gilmer, the governor of Georgia, persuaded the federal government to withdraw Worcester's appointment as postmaster in order to make him subject to arrest. Opinion. Chief Justice John Marshall laid out in this opinion the relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. He argued that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the rights of Great Britain as they were held by that nation. Those rights, he stated, are the sole right of dealing with the Indian nations in North America, to the exclusion of any other European power, and not the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those are in the hands of the federal government and not the states. The court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a ""distinct community"" with self-government ""in which the laws of Georgia can have no force."" It established the doctrine that the national government of the United States, and not individual states, had authority in American Indian affairs. Legacy. Jackson's response. In a popular quotation, President Andrew Jackson is supposed to have said: ""John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!"". This derives from Jackson's consideration on the case in a letter to John Coffee, """"...the decision of the Supreme Court has fell still born, and they find that they cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate,"""" (that is, the Court's opinion because it had no power to enforce its edict). The ruling in ""Worcester"" ordered that Worcester be freed; Georgia complied after several months. In 1833, the newly elected governor, Wilson Lumpkin, offered to pardon Worcester and Butler if they ceased their activities among the Cherokee. The two complied and were freed (under the authority of a January 14, 1833 general proclamation, not a formal pardon); they never returned to Cherokee lands. The federal government and the Cherokee were not party to the suit. ""Worcester"" imposed no obligations on Jackson; there was nothing for him to enforce. The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision, as had become standard. ""Worcester"" may be seen as a prudential decision, for avoiding the possibility of political conflict between the Court and the Executive, while still delivering what appeared to be a pro-Indian decision. As a tribal sovereignty precedent. Marshall's language in ""Worcester"" may have been motivated by his regret that his earlier opinions in ""Fletcher"" and ""Johnson"" had been used as a justification for Georgia's actions. Justice Story considered it similarly, writing in a letter to his wife dated March 4, 1832: ""Thanks be to God, the Court can wash their hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights."" Because Jackson proceeded with Cherokee removal, ""Worcester"" did little more for indigenous rights than ""Johnson v. M'Intosh"" or ""Cherokee Nation v. Georgia"".  ""Worcester"" is cited in several later opinions on the subject of tribal sovereignty in the United States. "
wikipedia-388794," Ejection seat  In aircraft, an ejection seat is a system designed to rescue the pilot or other crew of an aircraft (usually military) in an emergency. In most designs, the seat is propelled out of the aircraft by an explosive charge or rocket motor, carrying the pilot with it. The concept of an ejectable escape crew capsule has also been tried. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat deploys a parachute. Ejection seats are common on certain types of military aircraft. History. A bungee-assisted escape from an aircraft took place in 1910. In 1916 Everard Calthrop, an early inventor of parachutes, patented an ejector seat using compressed air. The modern layout for an ejection seat was first proposed by Romanian inventor Anastase Dragomir in the late 1920s. The design, featuring a ""parachuted cell"" (a dischargeable chair from an aircraft or other vehicle), was successfully tested on 25 August 1929 at the Paris-Orly Airport near Paris and in October 1929 at Băneasa, near Bucharest. Dragomir patented his ""catapult-able cockpit"" at the French Patent Office. The design was perfected during World War II. Prior to this, the only means of escape from an incapacitated aircraft was to jump clear (""bail-out""), and in many cases this was difficult due to injury, the difficulty of egress from a confined space, ""g"" forces, the airflow past the aircraft, and other factors. The first ejection seats were developed independently during World War II by Heinkel and SAAB. Early models were powered by compressed air and the first aircraft to be fitted with such a system was the Heinkel He 280 prototype jet-engined fighter in 1940. One of the He 280 test pilots, Helmut Schenk, became the first person to escape from a stricken aircraft with an ejection seat on 13 January 1942 after his control surfaces iced up and became inoperable. The fighter, being used in tests of the Argus As 014 impulse jets for Fieseler Fi 103 missile development, had its usual HeS 8A turbojets removed, and was towed aloft from Rechlin, Germany by a pair of Bf 110C tugs in a heavy snow-shower. At , Schenk found he had no control, jettisoned his towline, and ejected. The He 280 was never put into production status and the first operational type to provide ejection seats for the crew was the Heinkel He 219 ""Uhu"" night fighter in 1942. In Sweden, a version using compressed air was tested in 1941. A gunpowder ejection seat was developed by Bofors and tested in 1943 for the Saab 21. The first test in the air was on a Saab 17 on 27 February 1944, and the first real use occurred by Lt. Bengt Johansson on 29 July 1946 after a mid-air collision between a J 21 and a J 22. In late 1944, the Heinkel He 162 featured a new type of ejection seat, this time fired by an explosive cartridge. In this system, the seat rode on wheels set between two pipes running up the back of the cockpit. When lowered into position, caps at the top of the seat fitted over the pipes to close them. Cartridges, basically identical to shotgun shells, were placed in the bottom of the pipes, facing upward. When fired, the gases would fill the pipes, ""popping"" the caps off the end, and thereby forcing the seat to ride up the pipes on its wheels and out of the aircraft. By the end of the war, the Do-335 ""Pfeil"" and a few prototype aircraft were also fitted with ejection seats. After World War II, the need for such systems became pressing, as aircraft speeds were getting ever higher, and it was not long before the sound barrier was broken. Manual escape at such speeds would be impossible. The United States Army Air Forces experimented with downward-ejecting systems operated by a spring, but it was the work of Sir James Martin and his company Martin-Baker that was to prove crucial. The first live flight test of the Martin-Baker system took place on 24 July 1946, when fitter Bernard Lynch ejected from a Gloster Meteor Mk III jet. Shortly afterward, on 17 August 1946, 1st Sgt. Larry Lambert was the first live U.S. ejectee. Lynch demonstrated the ejection seat at the ""Daily Express"" Air Pageant in 1948, ejecting from a Meteor. Martin-Baker ejector seats were fitted to prototype and production aircraft from the late 1940s, and the first emergency use of such a seat occurred in 1949 during testing of the jet-powered Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 experimental flying wing. Early seats used a solid propellant charge to eject the pilot and seat by igniting the charge inside a telescoping tube attached to the seat. As aircraft speeds increased still further, this method proved inadequate to get the pilot sufficiently clear of the airframe. Increasing the amount of propellant risked damaging the occupant's spine, so experiments with rocket propulsion began. In 1958, the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger was the first aircraft to be fitted with a rocket-propelled seat. Martin-Baker developed a similar design, using multiple rocket units feeding a single nozzle. The greater thrust from this configuration had the advantage of being able to eject the pilot to a safe height even if the aircraft was on or very near the ground. In the early 1960s, deployment of rocket-powered ejection seats designed for use at supersonic speeds began in such planes as the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. Six pilots have ejected at speeds exceeding . The highest altitude at which a Martin-Baker seat was deployed was 57,000 ft (from a Canberra bomber in 1958). Following an accident on 30 July 1966 in the attempted launch of a D-21 drone, two Lockheed M-21 crew members ejected at Mach 3.25 at an altitude of The pilot was recovered successfully, but the launch control officer drowned after a water landing. Despite these records, most ejections occur at fairly low speeds and altitudes, when the pilot can see that there is no hope of regaining aircraft control before impact with the ground. Late in the Vietnam War, the USAF and US Navy became concerned about its pilots ejecting over hostile territory and those pilots either being captured or killed and the losses in men and aircraft in attempts to rescue them. Both services began a program titled ""Air Crew Escape/Rescue Capability"" or ""Aerial Escape and Rescue Capability"" (AERCAB) ejection seats (both terms have been used by the US military and defence industry), where after the pilot ejected, the ejection seat would fly him to a location far enough away from where he ejected to where he could safely be picked up. A Request for Proposals for concepts for AERCAB ejection seats were issued in the late 1960s. Three companies submitted papers for further development: A Rogallo wing design by Bell Systems; a gyrocopter design by Kaman Aircraft; and a mini-conventional fixed wing aircraft employing a Princeton Wing (i.e. a wing made of flexible material that rolls out and then becomes rigid by means of internal struts or supports etc. deploying) by Fairchild Hiller. All three, after ejection, would be propelled by small turbojet engine developed for target drones. With the exception of the Kaman design, the pilot would still be required to parachute to the ground after reaching a safety-point for rescue. The AERCAB project was terminated in the 1970s with the end of the Vietnam War. The Kaman design, in early 1972, was the only one which was to reach the hardware stage. It came come close to being tested with a special landing-gear platform attached to the AERCAB ejection seat for first-stage ground take offs and landings with a test pilot. Pilot safety. The purpose of an ejection seat is pilot survival. The pilot typically experiences an acceleration of about 12–14 ""g"" (117–137 m/s2). Western seats usually impose lighter loads on the pilots; 1960s-70s era Soviet technology often goes up to 20–22 ""g"" (with SM-1 and KM-1 gunbarrel-type ejection seats). Compression fractures of vertebrae are a recurrent side effect of ejection. The U.S. government selected the Martin-Baker seat for the U.S.A.'s new Joint Strike Fighter. The F-22 Raptor uses a variant of the ACES II ejection seat. The capabilities of the NPP Zvezda K-36 were unintentionally demonstrated at the Fairford Air Show on 24 July 1993 when the pilots of two MiG-29 fighters ejected after a mid-air collision. The minimal ejection altitude for ACES II seat in inverted flight is about above ground level at 150 KIAS. While the Russian counterpart - K-36DM has the minimal ejection altitude from inverted flight of AGL. When an aircraft is equipped with the Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat and the pilot is wearing the КО-15 protective gear, he is able to eject at airspeeds from 0 to and altitudes of 0 to 25 km (16 mi or about 82,000 ft). The K-36DM ejection seat features drag chutes and a small shield that rises between the pilot's legs to deflect air around the pilot. Pilots have successfully ejected from underwater in a handful of instances, after being forced to ditch in water. Documented evidence exists that pilots of the US and Indian Navies have performed this feat. As of 20 June 2011 – when two Spanish Air Force pilots ejected over San Javier airport – the number of lives saved by Martin-Baker products was 7,402 from 93 air forces. The company runs a club called the 'Ejection Tie Club' and gives survivors a unique tie and lapel pin. The total figure for all types of ejection seats is unknown, but may be considerably higher. Egress systems. The ""standard"" ejection system operates in two stages. First, the entire canopy or hatch above the aviator is opened or jettisoned, and the seat and occupant are launched through the opening. In most earlier aircraft this required two separate actions by the aviator, while later egress system designs, such as the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat model 2 (ACES II), perform both functions as a single action. The ACES II ejection seat is used in most American-built fighters. The A-10 uses connected firing handles that activate both the canopy jettison systems, followed by the seat ejection. The F-15 has the same connected system as the A-10 seat. Both handles accomplish the same task, so pulling either one suffices. The F-16 has only one handle located between the pilot's knees, since the cockpit is too narrow for side-mounted handles. Non-standard egress systems include Downward Track (used for some crew positions in bomber aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress), Canopy Destruct (CD) and Through-Canopy Penetration (TCP), Drag Extraction, Encapsulated Seat, and even Crew Capsule. Early models of the F-104 Starfighter were equipped with a Downward Track ejection seat due to the hazard of the T-tail. In order to make this work, the pilot was equipped with ""spurs"" which were attached to cables that would pull the legs inward so the pilot could be ejected. Following this development, some other egress systems began using leg retractors as a way to prevent injuries to flailing legs, and to provide a more stable center of gravity. Some models of the F-104 were equipped with upward-ejecting seats. Similarly, two of the six ejection seats on the B-52 Stratofortress fire downward, through hatch openings on the bottom of the aircraft; the downward hatches are released from the aircraft by a thruster that unlocks the hatch, while gravity and wind remove the hatch and arm the seat. The four seats on the forward upper deck (two of them, EWO and Gunner, facing the rear of the airplane) fire upwards as usual. Any such downward-firing system is of no use on or near the ground if aircraft is in level flight at the time of the ejection. Aircraft designed for low-level use sometimes have ejection seats which fire through the canopy, as waiting for the canopy to be ejected is too slow. Many aircraft types (e.g., the BAE Hawk and the Harrier line of aircraft) use Canopy Destruct systems, which have an explosive cord (MDC - Miniature Detonation Cord or FLSC - Flexible Linear Shaped Charge) embedded within the acrylic plastic of the canopy. The MDC is initiated when the eject handle is pulled, and shatters the canopy over the seat a few milliseconds before the seat is launched. This system was developed for the Hawker Siddeley Harrier family of VTOL aircraft as ejection may be necessary while the aircraft was in the hover, and jettisoning the canopy might result in the pilot and seat striking it. This system is also used in the T-6 Texan II. Through-Canopy Penetration is similar to Canopy Destruct, but a sharp spike on the top of the seat, known as the ""shell tooth,"" strikes the underside of the canopy and shatters it. The A-10 Thunderbolt II is equipped with canopy breakers on either side of its headrest in the event that the canopy fails to jettison. The T-6 is also equipped with such breakers if the MDC fails to detonate. In ground emergencies, a ground crewman or pilot can use a breaker knife attached to the inside of the canopy to shatter the transparency. The A-6 Intruder and EA-6B Prowler seats are capable of ejecting through the canopy, with canopy jettison a separate option if there is enough time. CD and TCP systems cannot be used with canopies made of flexible materials, such as the Lexan polycarbonate canopy used on the F-16. Soviet VTOL naval fighter planes such as the Yakovlev Yak-38 were equipped with ejection seats which were automatically activated during at least some part of the flight envelope. Drag Extraction is the lightest and simplest egress system available, and has been used on many experimental aircraft. Halfway between simply ""bailing out"" and using explosive-eject systems, Drag Extraction uses the airflow past the aircraft (or spacecraft) to move the aviator out of the cockpit and away from the stricken craft on a guide rail. Some operate like a standard ejector seat, by jettisoning the canopy, then deploying a drag chute into the airflow. That chute pulls the occupant out of the aircraft, either with the seat or following release of the seat straps, who then rides off the end of a rail extending far enough out to help clear the structure. In the case of the Space Shuttle, the astronauts would have ridden a long, curved rail, blown by the wind against their bodies, then deployed their chutes after free-falling to a safe altitude. Encapsulated Seat egress systems were developed for use in the B-58 Hustler and B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bombers. These seats were enclosed in an air-operated clamshell, which permitted the aircrew to escape at airspeeds and altitudes high enough to otherwise cause bodily harm. These seats were designed to allow the pilot to control the plane even with the clamshell closed, and the capsule would float in case of water landings. Some aircraft designs, such as the General Dynamics F-111, do not have individual ejection seats, but instead, the entire section of the airframe containing the crew can be ejected as a single capsule. In this system, very powerful rockets are used, and multiple large parachutes are used to bring the capsule down, in a manner similar to the Launch Escape System of the Apollo spacecraft. On landing, an airbag system is used to cushion the landing, and this also acts as a flotation device if the Crew Capsule lands in water. Zero-zero ejection seat. A zero-zero ejection seat is designed to safely extract upward and land its occupant from a grounded stationary position (i.e., zero altitude and zero airspeed), specifically from aircraft cockpits. The zero-zero capability was developed to help aircrews escape upward from unrecoverable emergencies during low-altitude and/or low-speed flight, as well as ground mishaps. Before this capability, ejections could only be performed above minimum altitudes and airspeeds. Zero-zero technology uses small rockets to propel the seat upward to an adequate altitude and a small explosive charge to open the parachute canopy quickly for a successful parachute descent, so that proper deployment of the parachute no longer relies on airspeed and altitude. Other aircraft. The Kamov Ka-50, which entered limited service with Russian forces in 1995, was the first production helicopter with an ejection seat. The system is similar to that of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft however the main rotors are equipped with explosive bolts to release the blades moments before the seat is fired. The Lunar Lander Research Vehicle (LLRV)/Training Vehicle (LLTV) used ejection seats. Neil Armstrong ejected on 6 May 1968; Joe Algranti & Stuart M. Present, later. Early flights of the NASA's Space Shuttle were with a crew of two, both provided with ejector seats, (STS-1 to STS-4), but the seats were disabled and then removed as the crew size was increased. The Soviet shuttle """"Buran"""" was planned to be fitted with K-36RB (K-36M-11F35) seats, but it was unmanned on its single flight; the seats were never installed. The only spacecraft ever flown with installed ejection seats were the Space Shuttle, the Soviet ""Vostok"" and American Gemini series. "
wikipedia-389363," Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan  The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU, ) is a militant Islamist group formed in 1991 by the Islamic ideologue Tahir Yuldashev, and former Soviet paratrooper Juma Namangani—both ethnic Uzbeks from the Fergana Valley. Its objective was to overthrow President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan, and to create an Islamic state under Sharia. Operating out of bases in Tajikistan and Taliban-controlled areas of northern Afghanistan, the IMU launched a series of raids into southern Kyrgyzstan in 1999 and 2000. However, in 2001 the IMU was largely destroyed while fighting alongside the Taliban against coalition forces in Afghanistan. Namangani was killed, and the IMU's remaining fighters were dispersed. Yuldeshev and an unknown number of fighters escaped with remnants of the Taliban to Waziristan in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Since then the IMU has reportedly opened training camps in Waziristan and is now involved with other groups attempting to overthrow the government of Pakistan. Despite occasional proclamations from Yuldeshev, and rumours of a re-emergence under the name the Islamic Movement of Turkestan (IMT), there is no reliable evidence indicating that the IMU/IMT remains an operational force in Central Asia outside of the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region. Background. During the Soviet era, Islam in Central Asia was officially suppressed – mosques were closed, and all contact with the wider Muslim world was severed. This isolation ended with the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989), when thousands of conscripts from Soviet Central Asia were sent to fight the Afghan mujahedin. Many of these conscripts returned home impressed by the Islamic zeal of their opponents, and newly aware of the religious, cultural and linguistic characteristics they shared with their neighbours in the South – and which distinguished them from their rulers in Moscow. Adolat (1991–1992). One such soldier sent to fight in Afghanistan was the Uzbek paratrooper Jumaboi Khojayev (b. 1969). Following the war, Khojayev returned to his hometown of Namangan in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley radicalized by his experiences, and became associated with a local Islamic ideologue, Tohir Yuldashev (b. 1967). In the period of initial instability that followed Uzbekistan's sudden independence in 1991, Yuldeshev and Khojayev (now adopting the ""nom de guerre"" Juma Namangani) established a radical Salafi Islamist group in Namangan which they called Adolat (Justice). Adolat assumed civil authority in Namangan and quickly established a degree of order and security through the imposition of Sharia Law, which was ruthlessly enforced by Adolat's vigilante cadres. Initially tolerated by the newly installed President Karimov, Adolat became increasingly assertive, culminating in a demand that Karimov impose Sharia throughout Uzbekistan. However, by 1992 Karimov had successfully cemented his authority in Tashkent, and was strong enough to outlaw Adolat and re-establish central control over the Fergana Valley region – traditionally one of the most Islamic regions in Central Asia. Tajik Civil War (1992–1997). Evading arrest, Yuldashev and Namagani fled to Tajikistan, where civil war was raging following a bloody but successful coup led by Emomali Rahmonov earlier in 1992. The civil war pitted Rahmonov's neo-communist forces against a loose coalition of democrats and Islamists known as the United Tajik Opposition (UTO). The UTO was led by the widely popular and highly respected Islamist Said Abdullah Nuri, whose Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) advocated a moderate and democratic brand of Islamism. Namangani's combat experience in Afghanistan saw him entrusted by the IRPT with the command of active units in the field, based out of the remote, mountainous Tavildara Valley region – a role he carried out with considerable success. Meanwhile, Yuldashev left Tajikistan on a tour of Afghanistan, Turkey and the Middle East, during which time he developed contacts with numerous Islamist groups. From 1995-8 Yuldashev was based in Peshawar in Pakistan, where he established relations with Osama Bin Laden and the Afghan Arabs based there at the time. IMU Formation (1998). In 1997 Rahmonov and Nuri signed a peace agreement which saw Rahmonov agree to sharing power with the IRPT. Disillusioned with the political concessions made by the Tajik Islamists, Yuldeshev and Namangani formed the IMU in 1998 with the aim of creating a militant Islamic opposition to Karimov in Uzbekistan. Receiving initial funding and assistance from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, the IMU began moving towards the Afghan Taliban and away from their former and more moderate IRPT allies – who were in turn backing the ethnic-Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and his Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Nevertheless, Namangani maintained his base in Tajikistan's Tavildara Valley, and was able to recruit large numbers of disaffected youth from the Fergana Valley, where economic hardship and religious persecution were continuing under Karimov's authoritarian rule. Operations. 1999. In 1999 a series of explosions in the capital Tashkent were orchestrated in an unsuccessful attempt on Karimov's life. Karimov placed the blame on radical Wahhabi Islamists, and the IMU in particular – however this attribution remains disputed, and it's possible the assassination attempt was the work of rival political and regional elites. Irrespective of who was responsible, the result was an escalation in Karimov's suppression of Islam, particularly in the traditionally observant Fergana Valley – a move which only increased the number of those fleeing Uzbekistan to join up with Namangani and the IMU in the Tavildara Valley. Later that year the IMU conducted its first verifiable operations, with an incursion into the Batken region of southern Kyrgyzstan – a region populated mainly by ethnic Uzbeks, and lying between Tavildara in Tajikistan and the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. Insurgents seized the Mayor of Osh (the regional capital) and successfully extorted a ransom from the ill-prepared Kyrgyz government in Bishkek, as well as a helicopter to transport them to Afghanistan. Further incursions into Batken followed, with one raid seeing a number of Japanese geologists kidnapped – although denied by Japan, their subsequent release almost certainly followed a significant ransom payment. These raids had a major impact in Central Asia, and resulted in considerable international pressure on Tajikistan, not least from Karimov, to expel the IMU from its base in the Tavildara Valley. The IRPT persuaded their former ally Namangani to abandon Tavildara in late 1999. Controversially, Namangani and his fighters were then flown from Tajikistan to northern Afghanistan in Russian military helicopters – a move which enraged Karimov, who claimed the Russians were aiding the IMU in an attempt to undermine Uzbekistan. 2000. In Afghanistan Yuldeshev was able to exploit the contacts he had made on his earlier travels to negotiate freedom of operation from the Taliban, in return for providing them with assistance in their battle with Massoud's Northern Alliance. The IMU established offices and training camps, and began expanding their recruitment of disaffected Uzbeks. It is estimated that the IMU were now approximately 2000 strong, and in the spring they contributed around 600 fighters to the Taliban's offensive against Massoud, participating in the successful siege of Taloqan, where they fought alongside Bin Laden's 555 Arab Brigade. The IMU also provided the Taliban with a useful degree of deniability – under pressure from China to expel Uighur militants the Taliban simply sent them north to the IMU's camps. By the summer of 2000 Western and CIS intelligence sources claim the IMU were equipped with more advanced weaponry such as sniper rifles and night-vision goggles, and had been supplied with a pair of heavy transport helicopters by Bin Laden. Namangani led IMU fighters back to the Tavildara Valley in Tajikistan, and from there launched multipronged attacks into Batken in Kyrgyzstan, and also into northern Uzbekistan, close to Tashkent. In August 2000 the IMU also kidnapped four U.S. mountain-climbers in the Kara-Su Valley of Kyrgyzstan, holding them hostage until they escaped on 12 August. In response, the United States classified the IMU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Once again the raids were followed by a strategic retreat to Tavildara, and once again international pressure on the Tajik government saw Namangani agree to him and his men being flown by the Russians back to Afghanistan, where they arrived in January 2001. In his book ""Terror and Consent"", Philip Bobbitt noted that Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a scientist of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, had met Osama bin Laden in Kabul in August 2001. Mahmood is said to have disclosed that bin Laden ""insisted that he already had sufficient fissile material to build a bomb, having obtained it from former Soviet stockpiles through the Islamic Movement of Ubekistan."" 2001. By now the connections between the IMU and the Taliban had become more overt – the media reported that Namangani had been appointed Deputy Defence Minister in the Taliban government, which the Taliban did not deny. In the spring the IMU again supplied the Taliban with 600 fighters for a renewed campaign against Massoud, while in Batken in Kyrgyzstan a number of sleepers armed the previous year executed a series of attacks. However, following 9/11 and the US-led coalition intervention in Afghanistan, the IMU was largely destroyed while fighting alongside the Taliban, and Namangani himself was killed. The IMU's fighters were scattered, with Yuldeshev and many others fleeing along with remnants of the Taliban to the tribal areas of Pakistan. In September 2002 an aide to Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, the Foreign Minister of the Taliban, claimed he had been sent prior to 9/11 to warn the U.S. government of an impending attack and to persuade them to take military action against Al Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan. The aide claimed advance knowledge of the attack came from Yuldashev, which if true would indicate a high degree of cooperation between Al-Qaeda and the IMU. Current status. Ethnic groups and current activities. While originally an ethnic Uzbek movement it is now said by the Australian government to include Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uyghur and Turkmen members as well. The IMU is alleged by the magazine ""Eurasia Critic"" to be involved in organized criminal activities such as controlling and facilitating drug smuggling. The IMU is alleged by the United States of America to receive funding from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. While the IMU has been operationally inactive in Uzbekistan since 2001, it has been active in Afghanistan and is regularly cited as a terrorist threat by governments within and outside of the region. From 2007 through 2009, IMU fighters were active in parts of Afghanistan supporting insurgent groups and fighting ISAF troops. In 2003, A. Elizabeth Jones, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, testified on the threat of terrorism in Central Asia before the U.S. House of Representatives' subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia, arguing that the greatest threats were the IMU, and Hizb ut-Tahrir. Jones said that despite the death of Namangani, the ""IMU is still active in the region -- particularly in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan -- and it represents a serious threat to the region and therefore to our interests."" In addition, the government of Russia banned the movement under the name ""Islamic Party of Turkestan"" in 2006. On 7 August 2006, Kyrgyz special forces killed Rafik Kamalov, an alleged leader of the movement, in the Kyrgyz border town of Kara-Suu. Mahmadsaid Juraqulov, head of the anti-organized crime department in the Interior Ministry of Tajikistan, told reporters in Dushanbe on 16 October 2006 that the ""Islamic Movement of Turkestan is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan,"" and that Uzbek secret services manufactured the change in name. Juraqulov also said that the IMT was not a major security threat to Tajikistan or Kyrgyzstan. ""Everyone knows that it is in Uzbekistan that IMU wants to create problems. For them, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are just regrouping bases they're trying to reach."" The Tajik government announced that it was seeking 23 suspected IMU members who Tajik authorities say attacked supporters of Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov on 28 September 2006, wounding two people. Between July 2006 and September 2007, 31 persons accused of IMU membership were arrested in the Sughd region in the north of Tajikistan. They were sentenced to 12 – 18 years of prison. However, while Yuldeshev has issued a number of pronouncements suggesting a widening of the IMU's focus, evidence does not support the notion that the IMU remains a credible threat in the region. Furthermore, events in early 2007 suggested that the IMU might no longer be able to count on refuge in Pakistan's tribal belt. In March local Pakistani and reportedly Arab militants turned against the IMU in the Wana conflict. Some analysts have asserted that rather than the image of a unified IMU under Namangani and Yuldeshev, it has always been an organization consisting of two poles – the radical, spiritual (Yuldeshev) and militant, criminal (Namangani). With the latter's death in 2001, it was expected that a less mujahideen-style of warfare would emerge favouring terror-style attacks. The 2004 Tashkent bombings attributed to a group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Union may have been perpetrated by IMU operatives as well. Nevertheless, in a context of continued socieoeconomic deprivation and an absence of political pluralism, a resurgence of militant Islam in the region cannot be ruled out. On 30 September 2009, a man claiming to be a bodyguard of Tahir Yuldashev reported that Yuldashev had been killed in a US missile airstrike that occurred shortly after the death of Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud. On August 16, 2010 Furqon, an Uzbek-language website run by the al Qaeda-linked Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, put up two images of Yuldahsev, who was described as ""Shaheed Mohammed Tahir,"" and said he was ""slain."" Shaheed is a term used by Islamist groups to describe martyrs who are killed in combat. The IMU did not indicate how or when Yuldashev was killed. On the following day the IMU announced on the same website that Yuldashev's long-serving deputy, Abu Usman Adil, was its new leader, and that Yuldashev had been killed on August 27, 2009 by a US Predator airstrike in South Waziristan. Abu Usman also called for his followers to wage jihad in the southern portion of Kyrgyzstan. In August 2012 Furqon announced that Abu Usman Adil had been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan in April 2012, and that his deputy, Usman Ghazi, had succeeded him as the new leader of the group. Diaspora. On December 3, 2012, ten alleged members of a group that sent tens of thousands of euros to IMU went on trial in Paris. The suspects, mainly of Turkish origin, are alleged to have collected funds in mosques in various French cities to send to the IMU between 2003 and 2008. They were detained in a 2008 sweep that included arrests in eastern France, the Netherlands and Germany. The central figure in the group is Irfan Demirtas, a Turkish-Dutch citizen. Nine out of the ten were convicted on January 8, 2013, with Demirtas receiving an eight-year prison sentence and a €20,000 fine. "
wikipedia-389370," Tohir Yo‘ldosh  Tohir Abduhalilovich Yuldashev (Russian: Тахир Абдухалилович Юлдашев ""Takhir Abdukhalilovich Yuldashev""), (October 2, 1967 – August 27, 2009) cofounded the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Islamist organization active in Central Asia, with Juma Namangani in December 1991. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency he was a key leader opposing US forces during Operation Anaconda. The United Nations considers the IMU an Islamic terrorist organization. When anti-Taliban forces killed Namangani, the IMU's military leader and cofounder, in Afghanistan in 2001, Yuldashev took over the IMU's day-to-day operations as well. According to the ""BBC"", Yuldashev learned that al Qaeda was planning to use hijacked airliners to attack the United States on September 11, 2001, prior to the attacks. The ""BBC"" reported that Yuldashev then informed the Taliban Foreign Minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, who sent an envoy to warn the USA of al Qaeda's attack plans prior to September 11, 2001. According to the ""BBC"" Yuldashev was told to initiate an advance warning to the USA of the attacks because he was concerned that an al Qaeda attack on the USA would trigger an American counter-attack, which would imperil the safe haven his group had been enjoying in Afghanistan. A video message from Tohir Yuldashev was reportedly distributed throughout the Uzbek areas of Central Asia in early 2007. In the video Tohir was reported to have said:  After Baitullah Mehsud was reported to have been killed by missiles fired from an American Predator drone the ""Asia Times"" reported that Yuldashev had been Baitullah's ideological mentor, that Yuldashev had put 2,500 hardened fighters at his disposal, and that Baitullah lived with the Uzbek, who became his biggest ideological inspiration. On September 30, 2009, a man, who claimed to be Yuldashev's bodyguard, reported to the Pakistan newspaper ""The News International"" that Yuldashev was killed in a US Predator drone airstrike shortly after Mehsud's death. US and Pakistan officials afterwards confirmed Yuldashev was killed in an airstrike on August 27, 2009. Yuldashev reportedly lost a leg and arm in the drone missile strike on August 27, 2009 and was rushed to a hospital in Zhob in Baluchistan, but died the next day. On August 16, 2010, Furqan, an Uzbek-language website run by the al Qaeda-linked Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, put up two images of Yuldashev, who was described as ""Shaheed Mohammed Tahir,"" and said he was ""slain."" Shaheed is a term used by Islamist groups to describer martyrs who are killed in combat. The IMU did not indicate how or when Yuldashev was killed. On August 17, 2010 Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan announced its new leader, just one day after confirming the death of Tohir Yuldashev.  Abu Usman Adil announced that he was the new leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, in a statement released on the terror group's website, Furqan. In the online statement, Usman said Yuldashev was killed as a result of the Aug. 27, 2009, US Predator airstrike in South Waziristan. Prior to assuming control of the IMU, Abu Usman served for years as Yuldashev's deputy.  Usman also called for his followers to wage jihad in the southern portion of Kyrgyzstan. A month after the strike last year that targeted Yuldashev as he met with South Waziristan tribal leader Mullah Nazir, a controversy over Yuldashev's reported death emerged. While the IMU officially denied that Yuldashev had been killed, members of the terror group, including one of Yuldashev's bodyguards, claimed that the emir had indeed been killed. Both Abu Usman and an IMU spokesman known as Zubair ibn Abdurakhman were said to have replaced Yuldashev. Confusion over the status of Yuldashev and the leadership of the IMU abounded within the terror group in the aftermath of the Aug. 27, 2009, airstrike, US intelligence officials told The Long War Journal. Yuldashev was not killed during or immediately after the Aug. 27 airstrike, but died much later of complications from wounds suffered in the strike. Top IMU leaders were jockeying for control of the group while Yuldashev attempted to recover from his injuries.  "
wikipedia-389373," Ole Bull  Ole Bornemann Bull (5 February 181017 August 1880) was a Norwegian violinist and composer. Biography. Background. Bull was born in Bergen. He was the eldest of ten children of Johan Storm Bull (1787–1838) and Anna Dorothea Borse Geelmuyden (1789–1875). His brother, Georg Andreas Bull became a noted Norwegian architect. He was also the uncle of Edvard Hagerup Bull, Norwegian judge and politician. His father wished for him to become a minister, but he desired a musical career. At the age of four or five, he could play all of the songs he had heard his mother play on the violin. At age nine, he played first violin in the orchestra of Bergen's theatre and was a soloist with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. At eighteen, he was sent to the University of Christiania, but failed his examinations. He joined the Musical Lyceum, a musical society, and after its director Waldemar Thrane took ill, Bull became the director of Musical Lyceum and the Theater Orchestra in 1828. He also became friends with Henrik Wergeland, who later wrote a biography of Bull. Career. After living for a while in Germany, where he pretended to study law, he went to Paris but fared badly for a year or two. In 1832 in Paris he shared rooms with the Moravian violin virtuoso Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst. He was eventually successful in becoming a high-level virtuoso, giving thousands of concerts. In England alone these included 274 in 1837, during which visit he also travelled to some of the more remote parts of Britain. Bull became very famous and made a huge fortune. He is believed to have composed more than 70 works, but only about 10 are known today. Best known is ""Sæterjentens søndag"" (""The dairymaid's Sunday""). He also was a clever luthier, after studies in Paris with Vuillaume. He collected many beautiful violins and violas of Amati, Gasparo da Salò, Guarneri, Stradivari and others. He was the owner of one of the finest violins of the world, made by Gasparo da Salò about 1574 for Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria. He played a Guarneri del Gesù. The violin, a gift of his widow to Bull's birthplace, is now in the Bergen Vestlandske Kustindustrimuseum. A commercial signature line of Ole Bull violins was manufactured in Germany. Bull was caught up in the rising tide of Norwegian romantic nationalism and acclaimed the idea of Norway as a sovereign state, separate from Sweden, an idea which would become reality in 1905. In 1850, he co-founded the first theater in which the actors spoke the Norwegian language, rather than Danish, namely Det Norske Theater in Bergen, which later became Den Nationale Scene. In the summer of 1858, Bull met the 15-year-old Edvard Grieg. Bull was a friend of the Grieg family, since Ole Bull's brother was married to the sister of Grieg's mother. Bull noticed Edvard's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to further develop his talents at the Leipzig Conservatory. Robert Schumann once wrote that Bull was among ""the greatest of all,"" and that he was on a level with Niccolò Paganini for the speed and clarity of his playing. Bull was also a friend of Franz Liszt and played with him on several occasions. Ole Bull Colony. Bull visited the United States several times and was met with great success. In 1852, he obtained a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and founded a colony, which was called New Norway but which is commonly referred to as Ole Bull Colony. On 24 May 1852, he formally purchased for $10,388. The land consisted of four communities: New Bergen, now known as Carter Camp; Oleana, named after him and his mother, six miles (10 km) south of New Bergen; New Norway, one mile south of New Bergen; and Valhalla. Bull called the highest point in Valhalla, Nordjenskald, which became the location of his unfinished castle. This venture was soon given up, as there was scarcely any land to till, and Bull went back to giving concerts. Family life. In 1836 Bull married Alexandrine Félicie Villeminot. They had six children, only two of whom survived him. Alexandrine died in 1862. Their children were: In 1868 Bull met Sara Chapman Thorp (1850–1911), the daughter of a prosperous lumber merchant from Eau Claire, after a concert in Madison, Wisconsin. On a return visit in 1870 (and despite their age difference; he was 60, she was 20), Bull began a courtship, and the couple was secretly married in Norway in June 1870, with a formal wedding in Madison later that year. They had one daughter, Olea (1871–1913). In 1871, he bought a summer home on a rise in West Lebanon, Maine. Extolling the purity and health benefits of its well water, he named the property ""Ironwell"". Sara traveled with Bull for the remainder of his career, sometimes accompanying him on the piano. After Bull's death, the family lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Sara became a figure in local intellectual life. She translated two of the works of Jonas Lie into English. In 1883 she published a memoir of Bull's life. In her later life she became interested in Indian religious thought and helped sponsor early visits to the United States by gurus. Later years. Ole Bull bought the island of Lysøen in Os, south of Bergen, in 1872. He hired architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe to design a residence on the island. Bull died from cancer in his home on Lysøen on 17 August 1880. He had held his last concert in Chicago the same year, despite his illness. A testament to his fame was his funeral procession, perhaps the most spectacular in Norway's history. The ship transporting his body was guided by 15 steamers and a large number of smaller vessels.

wikipedia-389398," Alexandre Cabanel  Alexandre Cabanel (28 September 1823 – 23 January 1889) was a French painter born in Montpellier, Hérault. He painted historical, classical and religious subjects in the academic style. He was also well known as a portrait painter. According to ""Diccionario Enciclopedico Salvat"", Cabanel is the best representative of the L'art pompier and Napoleon III's preferred painter. He entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the age of seventeen. Cabanel studied with François-Édouard Picot and exhibited at the Paris Salon for the first time in 1844, and won the Prix de Rome scholarship in 1845 at the age of twenty two. Cabanel was elected a member of the Institute in 1863. He was appointed professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1864 and taught there until his death.  Cabanel won the Grande Médaille d'Honneur at the Salons of 1865, 1867, and 1878.  He was closely connected to the Paris Salon: ""He was elected regularly to the Salon jury and his pupils could be counted by the hundred at the Salons. Through them, Cabanel did more than any other artist of his generation to form the character of ""belle époque"" French painting"". His refusal together with William-Adolphe Bouguereau to allow the impressionist painter Édouard Manet and many other painters to exhibit their work in the Salon of 1863 led to the establishment of the Salon des Refusés by the French government. A successful academic painter, his 1863 painting ""The Birth of Venus"" is one of the best known examples of 19th century academic painting. The picture was bought by the emperor Napoleon III; there is also a smaller replica (painted in 1875 for a banker, John Wolf) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was gifted to them by Wolf in 1893. Pupils. His pupils included: "
wikipedia-389401," Scientific management  Scientific management, also called Taylorism, was a theory of management that analyzed and synthesized workflows. Its main objective was improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity. It was one of the earliest attempts to apply science to the engineering of processes and to management. Its development began with Frederick Winslow Taylor in the 1880s and 1890s within the manufacturing industries. Its peak of influence came in the 1910s; by the 1920s, it was still influential but had begun an era of competition and syncretism with opposing or complementary ideas.  Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of industrial engineering and management today. These include analysis; synthesis; logic; rationality; empiricism; work ethic; efficiency and elimination of waste; standardization of best practices; disdain for tradition preserved merely for its own sake or to protect the social status of particular workers with particular skill sets; the transformation of craft production into mass production; and knowledge transfer between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation. Scientific management's application was contingent on a high level of managerial control over employee work practices. This necessitated a higher ratio of managerial workers to laborers than previous management methods. The great difficulty in accurately differentiating any such intelligent, detail-oriented management from mere misguided management also caused interpersonal friction between workers and managers. While the terms ""scientific management"" and ""Taylorism"" are often treated as synonymous, an alternative view considers Taylorism as the ""first form"" of scientific management, which was followed by new iterations; thus in today's management theory, Taylorism is sometimes called (or considered a subset of) the classical perspective (meaning a perspective that's still respected for its seminal influence although it is no longer state-of-the-art). Taylor's own early names for his approach included ""shop management"" and ""process management"". When Louis Brandeis popularized the term ""scientific management"" in 1910, Taylor recognized it as another good name for the concept, and he used it himself in his 1911 monograph. The field comprised the work of Taylor; his disciples (such as Henry Gantt); other engineers and managers (such as Benjamin S. Graham); and other theorists, such as Max Weber. It is compared and contrasted with other efforts, including those of Henri Fayol and those of Frank Gilbreth, Sr. and Lillian Moller Gilbreth (whose views originally shared much with Taylor's but later evolved divergently in response to Taylorism's inadequate handling of human relations). Taylorism proper, in its strict sense, became obsolete by the 1930s, and by the 1960s the term ""scientific management"" had fallen out of favor for describing current management theories. However, many ""aspects"" of scientific management have never stopped being part of later management efforts called by other names. There is no simple dividing line demarcating the time when management as a modern profession (blending art, academic science, and applied science) diverged from Taylorism proper. It was a gradual process that began as soon as Taylor published (as evidenced by, for example, Hartness's motivation to publish his ""Human Factor"", or the Gilbreths' work), and each subsequent decade brought further evolution. Larger theme of economic efficiency. Scientific management is a variation on the theme of economic efficiency; it is a late 19th and early 20th century instance of the larger recurring theme in human life of increasing efficiency, decreasing waste, and using empirical methods to decide what matters, rather than uncritically accepting pre-existing ideas of what matters. Thus it is a chapter in a larger narrative that includes many ideas, from the folk wisdom of thrift to a profusion of applied-science successors, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was the broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management by that name with the later fields, and there is often no mutual exclusiveness when discussing the details of any one of these topics. In management literature today, the greatest use of the term ""scientific management"" is with reference to the work of Taylor, Omotosho Adeniyi Samson (Neyoo) and his disciples (""classical"", implying ""no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value"") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. In political and sociological terms, Taylorism can be seen as the division of labor pushed to its logical extreme, with a consequent de-skilling of the worker and dehumanisation of the workers and the workplace. Taylorism is often mentioned along with Fordism, because it was closely associated with mass production methods in factories, which was its earliest application. Today, task-oriented optimization of work tasks is nearly ubiquitous in industry. The theory behind it has evolved greatly since Taylor's day, reducing the ill effects, although in the wrong hands it is sometimes implemented poorly even now. Soldiering. Taylor observed that some workers were more talented than others, and that even smart ones were often unmotivated. He observed that most workers who are forced to perform repetitive tasks tend to work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished. This slow rate of work has been observed in many industries in many countries and has been called by various terms (some being slang confined to certain regions and eras), including """", (reflecting the way conscripts may approach following orders), ""dogging it"", ""goldbricking"", ""hanging it out"", and ""ca canae"". Managers may call it by those names or ""loafing"" or ""malingering""; workers may call it ""getting through the day"" or ""preventing management from abusing us"". Taylor used the term ""soldiering"" and observed that, when paid the same amount, workers will tend to do the amount of work that the slowest among them does. This reflects the idea that workers have a vested interest in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged (although many white-collar imitators of his ideas would forget) that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. He rejected the notion, which was universal in his day and still prevalent even now, of the secret magic of the craftsman—that the trades, including manufacturing, were black arts that could not be analyzed and could only be performed by craft production methods. In the course of his empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment as we know it today was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were taught to take more rests during work, and as a result production ""paradoxically"" increased. Unless people manage themselves, somebody has to take care of administration, and thus there is a division of work between workers and administrators. One of the tasks of administration is to select the right person for the right job: Relationship to mechanization and automation. Scientific management evolved in an era when mechanization and automation existed but had hardly gotten started, historically speaking, and were still embryonic. Two important corollaries flow from this fact: (1) The ideas and methods of scientific management were exactly what was needed to be added to the American system of manufacturing to extend the transformation from craft work (with humans as the only possible agents) to mechanization and automation; but also, (2) Taylor himself could not have known this, and his goals did not include the extensive removal of humans from the production process. During his lifetime, the very idea would have seemed like science fiction, because not only did the technological bridge to such a world not yet look plausible, but most people had not even considered that it could happen. Before digital computers existed, such ideas were not just outlandish but also mostly unheard of. Nevertheless, Taylor (unbeknownst to himself) was laying the groundwork for automation and offshoring, because he was analyzing processes into discrete, unambiguous pieces, which is exactly what computers and unskilled people need to follow algorithms designed by others and to make valid decisions within their execution. It is often said that computers are ""smart"" in terms of mathematic computation ability, but ""dumb"" because they must be told exactly ""what"" to calculate, ""when"", and ""how"", and (in the absence of any successful AI) they can never understand ""why"". With historical hindsight it is possible to see that Taylor was essentially inventing something like the highest-level computer programming for industrial process control and numerical control in the absence of any machines that could carry it out. But Taylor could not see it that way at the time; in his world, it was ""humans"" that would be the agents to execute the program. However, one of the common threads between his world and ours is that the agents of execution need not be ""smart"" to execute their tasks. In the case of computers, they are ""not able"" (yet) to be ""smart"" (in that sense of the word); in the case of human workers under scientific management, they were often ""able"" but were ""not allowed"". Once the time-and-motion men had completed their studies of a particular task, the workers had very little opportunity for further thinking, experimenting, or suggestion-making. They were expected (and forced) to ""play dumb"" most of the time (which, unsurprisingly to students of human nature, people tend to revolt against). In between craft production (with skilled workers) and full automation lies a natural middle ground of an engineered system of extensive mechanization and partial automation mixed with semiskilled and unskilled workers in carefully designed algorithmic workflows. Building and improving such systems requires knowledge transfer, which may seem simple on the surface but requires substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's original inspiration for scientific management was simply to replace inferior work methods with smarter ones, the same process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. This engineering was the essence not only of scientific management but also of most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of (successful instances of) offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer their way out of their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. Effects on labor relations in market economies. Taylor's view of workers. Taylor's view of workers was complex, having both insightful and obtuse elements. Taylorism took some steps toward addressing their needs (for example, Taylor advocated frequent breaks and good pay), but Taylor nevertheless had a condescending view of less intelligent workers, whom he sometimes compared to draft animals. And perhaps Taylor was so immersed in the vast work immediately in front of him (getting the world to understand and to implement scientific management's earliest phases) that he failed to strategize about the next steps (sustainability of the system after the early phases). Many other thinkers soon stepped forward to offer better ideas on the roles that humans would play in mature industrial systems. James Hartness, a fellow ASME member, published ""The Human Factor in Works Management"" in 1912. Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s. Some scholars, such as Harry Braverman, insisted that human relations did not replace Taylorism but rather that both approaches were complementary—Taylorism determining the actual organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as inherent parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises. Implementations of scientific management usually failed to account for several inherent challenges: Taylor himself, in fact, recognized these challenges and had some good ideas for meeting them. Nevertheless, his own implementations of his system (e.g., Watertown Arsenal, Link-Belt corporation, Midvale, Bethlehem) were never really very successful. They plugged along rockily and eventually were overturned, usually after Taylor had left. And countless managers who later aped or worshipped Taylor did even worse jobs of implementation. Typically they were less analytically talented managers who had latched onto scientific management as the latest fad for cutting the unit cost of production. Like bad managers even today, these were the people who used the big words without any deep understanding of what they meant. Taylor knew that scientific management could not work (probably at all, certainly never enduringly) unless the workers benefited from the profit increases that it generated. Taylor had developed a method for generating the increases, for the dual purposes of owner/manager profit and worker profit, realizing that the methods relied on both of those results in order to work correctly. But many owners and managers seized upon the methods thinking (wrongly) that the profits could be reserved solely or mostly for themselves and the system could endure indefinitely merely through force of authority. Workers are necessarily human: they have personal needs and interpersonal friction, and they face very real difficulties introduced when jobs become so efficient that they have no time to relax, and so rigid that they have no permission to innovate. Early decades: making jobs unpleasant. Under Taylorism, workers' work effort increased in intensity. Workers became dissatisfied with the work environment and became angry. During one of Taylor's own implementations, a strike at the Watertown Arsenal led to an investigation of Taylor's methods by a U.S. House of Representatives committee, which reported in 1912. The conclusion was that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered valuable organizational suggestions, but it gave production managers a dangerously high level of uncontrolled power. After an attitude survey of the workers revealed a high level of resentment and hostility towards scientific management, the Senate banned Taylor's methods at the arsenal. Certainly Taylorism's negative effects on worker morale only added more fuel to the fire of existing labor-management conflict, which frequently raged out of control between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries. Thus it inevitably contributed to the strengthening of labor unions and of labor-vs-management conflict (which was the opposite of any of Taylor's own hopes for labor relations). That outcome neutralized most or all of the benefit of any productivity gains that Taylorism had achieved. Thus its net benefit to owners and management ended up being small or negative. It would take new efforts, borrowing some ideas from Taylorism but mixing them with others, to produce more successful formulas. Later decades: making jobs disappear. To whatever extent scientific management caused the strengthening of labor unions by giving workers more to complain about than bad or greedy managers already gave them, it also led to other pressures tending toward worker unhappiness: the erosion of employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were made possible by the deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the knowledge transfer that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages just described. A central assumption of Taylorism was that ""the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the machinery."" The chain of connections between his work and automation is visible in historical hindsight, which sees that Taylorism made jobs unpleasant, and its logical successors then made them less remunerative and less secure; then scarcer; and finally (in many cases) nonexistent. Successors such as 'corporate reengineering' or 'business process reengineering' brought into sight the distant goal of the eventual elimination of industry's need for unskilled, and later, perhaps even most skilled human workers in any form, all stemming from the roots laid by Taylorism's recipe for deconstructing a process. As the resultant commodification of work advances, no skilled profession, even medicine, has proven to be immune from the efforts of Taylorism's successors, the 'reengineers', whose mandate often comes from skewed motives among people referred to as 'bean counters' and 'PHBs'. Effects on disruptive innovation. One of the traits of the era of applied science is that technology continually evolves. There is always a balance to be struck between scientific management's goal of formalizing the details of a process (which increases efficiency within the existing technological context) and the risk of fossilizing one moment's technological state into cultural inertia that stifles disruptive innovation (that is, preventing the next technological context from developing). To give one example, would John Parsons have been able to incubate the earliest development of numerical control if he were a worker in a red-tape-laden organization being told from above that the best way to mill a part had already been perfected, and therefore he had no business experimenting with his own preferred methods? Implementations of scientific management (often if not always) worked within the implicit context of a particular technological moment and thus did not account for the possibility of putting the ""continuous"" in ""continuous improvement process"". The notion of a ""one best way"" failed to add the coda, ""[… within the context of our current environment]""; it treated the context as constant (which it effectively was in a short-term sense) rather than as variable (which it always is in a long-term sense). Later methods such as lean manufacturing corrected this oversight by including ongoing innovation as part of their process and by recognizing the iterative nature of development. Relationship to Fordism. It is quite natural to jump to the post hoc conclusion that Fordism borrowed ideas from Taylorism and expanded from there. In fact it appears that Taylor himself did that when he visited the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants not too long before he died. But it seems that the methods at Ford were in fact independently reinvented based on logic, and that any influence from Taylorism either was nil or at least was far enough removed to be very indirect. Charles E. Sorensen disclaimed any connection at all. There was a climate at Ford at the time (which remained until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945) that the world's ""experts"" were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, its great successes would not exist. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded ""in spite of"", not ""because of"", experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other topics). Therefore Sorensen spoke very dismissively (and briefly) of Taylor, and the mention was only to lump him into the unneeded-so-called-expert category. Sorensen did speak very highly of Walter Flanders and credits him with being the first driving force behind the efficient floorplan layout at Ford. Sorensen says that Flanders knew absolutely nothing about Taylor. It is possible that Flanders (a New England machine tool whiz) had been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, although not to its name, and had been (at least subconsciously) influenced by it, but he did not cite it explicitly as he simply allowed logic to guide his production development. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the overall cultural zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915. This is not unlike other invention storylines, where it was more than just Watt who was working toward a practical steam engine (others were struggling with it contemporarily); more than just Fulton who was working on steam boats; more than just Edison who was working on electrical technology; and even regarding Henry Ford himself, more than just he who was working toward a truly practical automobile in the 1890s (people all over North America and Europe were trying during that era, which he freely admitted). The same can be said about the development of the engineering of processes between the 1890s and the 1920s, although the Ford team were not at all conscious of this at the time. They perceived themselves to be working in a vacuum in that respect, but historians can argue with them about the extent to which that was really true. Taylor was an early pioneer in the field of process analysis and synthesis (which is why many people, falling for the storytelling allure of the Great Man theory, tend to think that the whole field owes everything to him). But he did not have the field to himself for long. The world was ready for such development by the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And in fact many people started to work on it, sometimes independently, sometimes with direct or indirect influence on each other. Influence on planned economies. Scientific management was naturally appealing to managers of planned economies, because central economic planning relies on the idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design. The opposite theoretical pole would be laissez-faire thinking in which the invisible hand of free markets is the only possible ""designer"". In reality most economies today are somewhere in between. Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, Taylorism was advocated by Aleksei Gastev and ""nauchnaia organizatsia truda"" (""the movement for the scientific organisation of labor""). It found support in both Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939. Historian Thomas P. Hughes has detailed the way in which the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes Joseph Stalin: Hughes offers the equation ""Taylorismus + Fordismus = Amerikanismus"" to describe the Soviet view. Sorensen (1956) recounted his experience as one of the American consultants bringing Ford know-how (although he himself would not have called it Ford-""ism"") to the USSR during this brief era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen. East Germany. The German Federal Archives contain documentation created by the German Democratic Republic as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors. In the accompanying photograph, workers discuss standards that have recently been created specifying how each task should be done and how long it should take. By the 1950s, Taylor's original form of scientific management (and the name ""scientific management"" itself) had grown dated, but the goals and themes remained attractive and found new avatars. The workers in the photograph were engaged in a state-planned instance of process improvement, but they were essentially pursuing the same goals that were also contemporaneously pursued in the Free World by people like the developers of the Toyota Production System. Legacy. Scientific management was one of the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It was probably the first to do so in a ""bottom-up"" way, which is a concept that remains useful even today, in concert with other concepts. Two corollaries of this primacy are that (1) scientific management became famous and (2) it was merely the first iteration of a long-developing way of thinking, and many iterations have come since. Nevertheless, common elements unite them. With the advancement of statistical methods, quality assurance and quality control could begin in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into operations management, operations research, and management cybernetics. In the 1980s total quality management became widely popular, and in the 1990s ""re-engineering"" went from a simple word to a mystique (a kind of evolution that, unfortunately, draws bad managers to jump on the bandwagon without understanding what the bandwagon is). Today's Six Sigma and lean manufacturing could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their evolutionary distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese management culture in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management. Peter Drucker saw Frederick Taylor as the creator of knowledge management, because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management for all sorts of work, including the management of universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to ""the work of our salesmen"". Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for ""sales engineering"" (Person was talking about what is now called sales process engineering—engineering the processes that salespeople use—not about what we call sales engineering today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate marketing. Today's militaries employ all of the major goals and tactics of scientific management, if not under that name. Of the key points, all but wage incentives for increased output are used by modern military organizations. Wage incentives rather appear in the form of skill bonuses for enlistments. Scientific management has had an important influence in sports, where stop watches and motion studies rule the day. (Taylor himself enjoyed sports, especially tennis and golf. He and a partner won a national championship in doubles tennis. He invented improved tennis racquets and improved golf clubs, although other players liked to tease him for his unorthodox designs, and they did not catch on as replacements for the mainstream implements). Modern human resources can be seen to have begun in the scientific management era, most notably in the writings of Katherine M. H. Blackford, who was also a proponent of eugenics. "

Chalfont means chalk spring, in reference to the water carrying capacities of the local terrain. The village has a duck pond that is fed by River Misbourne. History. The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles is Norman and dates from the 12th century. It has a fine example of a lychgate. The Bishop Francis Hare is buried there. In the Domesday Book in 1086 Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter are listed as separate Manors with different owners. They were separate holding before the Norman Conquest. Like most other rural parishes it managed its civil affairs through the vestry until the Local Government Act 1894 required all parishes of over 300 people to have a Parish council independent of the Church. During the Great Plague of London in 1665, John Milton retired to Chalfont St Giles, which is where he completed his epic poem Paradise Lost. Milton's Cottage still stands in the village, and is open to the public. The inspiration for Paradise Regained is said to have been found in this parish from a conversation with a former pupil, Thomas Ellwood. The birthplace of J.T. Hearne, one of the greatest bowlers of the 1890s and 1900s, who died there in 1944, and of the actress Alexandra Gilbreath. Notable residents of the village have included Harry Golombek, Brian Connolly, Brian Cant, Chicane, Armando Iannucci, Noel Gallagher formerly of Oasis and Nick Clegg who became the Liberal Democrats party leader in 2007 and Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2010. The village has also given its name to Chalfont, Pennsylvania, which is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Amenities. The village is the closest to Hodgemoor Wood, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The village is twinned with Graft-De Rijp, Netherlands. Sport. The local football club is Chalfont Wasps, which was promoted to the Hellenic Football League Premier Division for the 2008–09 season. Chalfont St Giles has a tennis club, affiliated to the Lawn Tennis Association. To the northwest is Harewood Downs Golf Club. Film and television. Chalfont St Giles has been the location of several film and television programmes. It doubled as Walmington-on-Sea in the 1971 film version of ""Dad's Army"".

Chalfont St Peter is in close proximity to central London (), Heathrow Airport, Pinewood and Elstree film studios, and the motorway network (M25, M40, M1 and M4). History. Early history. At the time of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 949 there was no distinction made between the three separate villages: the whole area was known as ""Ceadeles funtan"", which is Anglo-Saxon meaning ""Caedele's Fountain"". The villages were however separated by 1237 when in manorial rolls Chalfont St Peter was referred to as ""Chalfund Sancti Petri"". The suffix St Peter is taken from the dedication of the church in the village. Chalfont St Peter was described in 1806 in ""Magna Britannia"" as follows: Modern history. Today, Chalfont St Peter is one of the largest villages in the United Kingdom partly due to the proximity to Gerrards Cross railway station which lies between London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill on the Chiltern Main Line. Modern buildings and urbanisation now dominate the village centre and very little historic architecture remains. The first major development of the village were rows of Georgian shops (some of which still remain). Much larger developments came in the late 1920s and these shops that run up the main street towards Gold Hill common now comprise most of the village centre. Modernisation and urbanisation continued up until the 1960s when most of the Georgian shops were demolished in favour of a concrete development of flats, offices and shops fronts surrounding a central car park.

It is one of a group of villages known collectively as The Chalfonts which also comprises Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter. Little Chalfont is located southeast of Aylesbury and northwest of Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. History. Little Chalfont is a 20th century creation triggered by the coming of the Metropolitan Line railway. A station called Chalfont Road was opened in 1889 at the northernmost point of Chalfont St Giles Parish where the parishes of Amersham, Chenies, and Chalfont St Giles met. At that time, the area was remote from the centres of the villages and towns, and consisted of isolated farms and cottages, and did not have a specific name. The coming of the railway eventually brought local housing development, and a community developed around the station, which was renamed to Chalfont and Latimer in 1915, a name which it retains today. The first appearance of the name Little Chalfont is in the minutes of the Chalfont St Giles Parish Council on 15 January 1925, when, at the request of the inhabitants, it was agreed that the group of houses near the station should be named Little Chalfont instead of ""Chalfont Road Village"". For many years, Little Chalfont was split mainly in the Amersham Town Council area, and partly in Chalfont St Giles parish. Following a period of campaigning by local residents, the village was awarded separate Parish status in 2007. Most of the new Parish came from Amersham, but a small part (in area, rather larger in population) of Chalfont St Giles was also included. Transport. Chalfont & Latimer station in Little Chalfont provides rail access to Central London via the Metropolitan Line and the London to Aylesbury Line. Education.

wikipedia-389463," Joiner  In the building trades, a joiner is a type of a carpenter that cuts and fits joints in wood without the use of nails, screws, or other metal fasteners. Joiners usually work in a workshop, because the formation of various joints usually requires non-portable machinery; in contrast, most other kinds of carpenter usually work on site. A ""joiner"" usually produces items such as interior and exterior doors, windows, stairs, tables, bookshelves etc.; cabinet makers are often regarded as producers of fine joinery. The terms ""joinery"" and ""joiner"" are obsolete in the USA, although the main trade union for carpenters still calls itself the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. In the UK, an apprentice of wood occupations could choose to study ""bench joinery"" or ""site carpentry and joinery""; bench joinery is the preparation, setting out, and manufacture of joinery components, while site carpentry and joinery focuses on the installation of the joinery components, and on the setting out and fabrication of timber elements used in construction.

wikipedia-389464," Makassar  Makassar (Buginese-Makassarese language: ᨀᨚᨈ ᨆᨀᨔᨑ) — sometimes spelled Macassar, Mangkasara — is the provincial capital of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and the largest city on Sulawesi Island. From 1971 to 1999, the city was named Ujung Pandang, after a precolonial fort in the city, and the two names are often used interchangeably. The port city is located at , on the southwest coast of the island of Sulawesi, facing the Makassar Strait. The city's area is 175.77 km2 and it had population of around 1.334 million at the 2010 Census. Its official metropolitan area, known as Mamminasata, covers an area of 2,473 km2 and had a population of 2,225,048 at the 2010 Census. History. Beginning in the sixteenth century and , Makassar was the dominant trading center of eastern Indonesia, and soon became one of the largest cities in island Southeast Asia. The Makassarese kings maintained a policy of free trade, insisting on the right of any visitor to do business in the city, and rejecting the attempts of the Dutch to establish a monopoly over the city. The trade in spices figured prominently in the history of Sulawesi, which involved frequent struggles between rival native and foreign powers for control of the lucrative during the pre-colonial and colonial period, when spices from the region were in high demand in the West. Much of South Sulawesi's early history was written in old texts that can be traced back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The first European settlers were the Portuguese sailors. When the Portuguese reached Sulawesi in 1511, they found Makassar a thriving cosmopolitan entre-port where Chinese, Arabs, Indians, Siamese, Javanese, and Malays came to trade their manufactured metal goods and textiles for pearls, gold, copper, camphor and spices – nutmeg, cloves and mace imported from the interior and the neighbouring Spice Islands of Maluku. By the 16th century, Makassar had become Sulawesi's major port and centre of the powerful Gowa and Tallo sultanates which between them had a series of 11 fortresses and strongholds and a fortified sea wall which extended along the coast. Portuguese rulers called the city Macáçar. The arrival of the Dutch in the early 17th century, altered events dramatically. They finally replaced the Portuguese as colonial masters in 1667, date that marks the beginning of the decline of Makassar. Their first objective was to create a hegemony over the spice trade and their first move was to capture the fort of Makassar in 1667, which they rebuilt and renamed Fort Rotterdam. From this base they managed to destroy the strongholds of the Sultan of Gowa who was then forced to live on the outskirts of Makassar. Following the Java War (1825–1830), Prince Diponegoro was exiled to Fort Rotterdam until his death in 1855. The character of this old trading centre changed as a walled city known as Vlaardingen grew, a place where slaves were at the bidding of the imposing foreigners. Gradually, in defiance of the Dutch, the Arabs, Malays and Bugis returned to trade outside the grim fortress walls and later also the Chinese. The town again became a collecting point for the produce of eastern Indonesia – the copra, rattan, pearls, trepang and sandalwood and the famous oil made from bado nuts used in Europe as men's hair dressing – hence the anti-macassars (embroidered cloths placed at head rests of upholstered chairs). Although the Dutch controlled the coast, it was not until the early 20th century that they gained power over the interior of the south through a series of treaties with local rulers. Meanwhile Dutch missionaries converted many of the Toraja people to Christianity. By 1938, the population of Makassar had reached around 84,000 – a town described by writer Joseph Conrad as ""the prettiest and perhaps, cleanest looking of all the towns in the islands"". In World War II the Makassar area was defended by approximately 1000 men of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army commanded by Colonel M. Vooren. He decided he couldn't defend on the coast and was planning to fight a guerilla war inland. The Japanese landed near Makassar on 9 February 1942. The defenders retreated but were soon overtaken & captured. Following the Indonesian National Revolution in 1950, Makassar was the site of fighting between pro-Federalist forces under Captain Abdul Assiz and Republican forces under Colonel Sunkono during the Makassar Uprising. By the 1950s, the population had increased to such a degree that many of the historic sites gave way to modern development and today you need to look very carefully to find the few remains of the city's once grand history. Further, tolerant religious attitudes meant that even as Islam became the dominant faith in the region, Christians and others were still able to trade in the city. With these attractions, Makassar was a key center for Malays working in the spice trade, as well as a valuable base for European and Arab traders from much further afield. Economy. The city is southern Sulawesi's primary port, with regular domestic and international shipping connections. It is nationally famous as an important port of call for the pinisi boats, sailing ships which are among the last in use for regular long-distance trade. During the colonial era, the city was famous for being the namesake of Makassar oil, which it exported in great quantity. Makassar ebony is a warm black hue, streaked with tan or brown tones, and highly prized for use in making fine cabinetry and veneers. Nowadays, as the largest city in Sulawesi Island and Eastern Indonesia, the city's economy depends highly on service sectors with approximately 70% from total share. Restaurant and hotel service are the largest contributor (29.14%), followed by transportation and communication (14.86%), trading (14.86), finance (10.58%). Industry follows behind service with 21.34%. Contact with Australia. Makassar is also a major fishing center in Sulawesi. One of its major industries is the trepang (sea cucumber) industry. Trepang fishing brought the Makassan people into contact with indigenous Australian peoples of northern Australia, long before European settlement (from 1788). C. C. MacKnight in his 1976 work entitled Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia has shown that they began frequenting the north of Australia some time around 1700 in search of trepang (sea-slug, sea cucumber, Beche-de-mer) an edible Holothurian. They left their waters during the North-west Monsoon in December or January for what is now Arnhem Land, Marege or Marega and to the Kimberley region or Kayu Djawa. They returned home with the South-east Trades in April. A fleet of between 24 and 26 Macassan prahus was seen in 1803 by the French explorers under Nicolas Baudin on the Holothuria Banks in the Timor Sea. In February 1803, Matthew Flinders in the Investigator met six prahus with 20–25 men each on board and was told that there were 60 prahus then on the north Australian coast. They were fishing for trepang and appeared to have only a small compass as a navigation aid. In June 1818 Macassan trepang fishing was noted by Phillip Parker King in the vicinity of Port Essington in the Arafura Sea. In 1864 R.J. Sholl, then resident magistrate for the European settlement at Camden Sound (near Augustus Island in the Kimberley region) observed seven ‘Macassan’ prahus with around 300 men on board. He believed that they made kidnapping raids and ranged as far south as Roebuck Bay (later Broome) where ‘quite a fleet’ was seen around 1866. Sholl believed that they did not venture south into other areas such as Nickol Bay (where the European pearling industry commenced around 1865) due to the absence of trepang in those waters. The Macassan voyages appear to have ceased sometime in the late nineteenth century and their place was taken by other sailors operating from elsewhere in the Indonesian Archipelago. Transportation. Makassar has a public transportation system called 'pete-pete'. A pete-pete (known elsewhere in Indonesia as angkot) is a mini-bus that has been modified to carry passengers. The route of Makassar's pete-petes is denoted by the letter on the windshield. Makassar is famous for their ""becak"" (pedicab) which is smaller than the ""becak"" in the island of Java. In Makassar, people who drive pedicab are called Daeng. The city airport is Hasanuddin International Airport which is actually located outside the Makassar city administration area, being situated in the regency of Maros. In addition to ""becak"" and ""pete-pete"", the city has government-run bus system, and taxis. January 2012: The limited capacity of the current dock at Soekarno-Hatta sea port will be expanded to 150x30 square meters to overcome queueing of at least two ships every day. A 35-kilometer monorail in the areas of Makassar, Maros Regency, Sungguminasa (Gowa Regency), and Takalar Regency (the ""Mamminasata"" region) will be realised in 2014 with cost predicted Rp.4 trillion ($468 million). The memorandum of understanding has been signed in 25 July 2011 by Makassar city, Maros Regency and Gowa Regency. Population.

wikipedia-389478," Apries  Apries () is the name by which Herodotus (ii. 161) and Diodorus (i. 68) designate Wahibre Haaibre, Ουαφρης (Pharaoh-Hophra), a pharaoh of Egypt (589 BC – 570 BC), the fourth king (counting from Psamtik I) of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt. He was equated with the Waphres of Manetho, who correctly records that he reigned for 19 years. Apries is also called Hophra in Jeremiah 44:30.  Apries inherited the throne from his father, pharaoh Psamtik II, in February 589 BC and his reign continued his father's history of foreign intrigue in Palestinian affairs. Apries was an active builder who constructed ""additions to the temples at Athribis (Tell Atrib), Bahariya Oasis, Memphis and Sais."" In Year 4 of his reign, Apries' sister Ankhnesneferibre was adopted as the new God's Wife of Amun at Thebes. However, Apries' reign was also fraught with internal problems. In 588 BC, Apries dispatched a force to Jerusalem to protect it from Babylonian forces sent by Nebuchadrezzar II. His forces were quickly crushed and Jerusalem, following an 18-month long siege, was destroyed by the Babylonians in either 587 BC or 586 BC. His unsuccessful attempt to intervene in the politics of the Kingdom of Judah was followed by a mutiny of soldiers from the strategically important Aswan garrison.  While the mutiny was contained, Apries later attempted to protect Libya from incursions by Dorian Greek invaders but his efforts here backfired spectacularly as his forces were mauled by the Greek invaders. When the defeated army returned home, a civil war broke out between the indigenous Egyptian army troops and foreign mercenaries in the Egyptian army. At this time of crisis, the Egyptians turned in support towards a victorious general, Amasis II who had led Egyptian forces in a highly successful invasion of Nubia in 592 BC under pharaoh Psamtik II, Apries' father. Amasis quickly declared himself pharaoh in 570 BC and Apries fled Egypt and sought refuge in another foreign country. When Apries marched back to Egypt in 567 BC with the aid of a Babylonian army to reclaim the throne of Egypt, he was likely killed in battle with Amasis' forces. Amasis thus secured his kingship over Egypt and was now the unchallenged ruler of Egypt.  Amasis, however, reportedly treated Apries' mortal remains with respect and observed the proper funerary rituals by having Apries' body carried to Sais and buried there with ""full military honours."" Amasis, the former general who had declared himself pharaoh also married Apries' daughter Chedebnitjerbone II to legitimise his accession to power. While Herodotus claimed that the wife of Apries was called Nitetis in (Greek), ""there are no contemporary references naming her"" in Egyptian records.  Eusebius placed the eclipse of Thales in 585 BC in the eighth or twelfth year of Apries' reign. Monuments. An obelisk which Apries erected at Sais was moved by the 3rd century AD Roman Emperor Diocletian and originally placed at the Temple of Isis in Rome. It is today located in front of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva basilica church in Rome.  "
wikipedia-389487," Bachelor of Business Administration  The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA or B.B.A.) is a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration. In most universities, the degree is conferred upon a student after four years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations; see below. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific concentrations.  The BSBA (Bachelor of Science in Business Administration) - a variant on this degree - usually differs as regards to General educational requirements. Program content. The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, while also allowing for specialization in a particular area. BBA programs thus expose students to a variety of ""core subjects"" and allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see MBA program content. The degree also develops the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. Many programs thus incorporate training and practical experience, in the form of case projects, presentations, internships, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry. The core topics usually comprise:  The specializations often include:  BBA. General educational requirements emphasize humanities and social sciences (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to ""Quantitative Applications for Business"" or, alternatively, courses in Calculus for business / Calculus 101, and business statistics / general statistics. BSBA. The BSBA is a variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively Math intensive; further, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing for additional quantitative optional coursework.

wikipedia-389496," Brendan Behan  Brendan Francis Behan ( ; ; 9 February 1923 – 20 March 1964) was an Irish poet, short story writer, novelist, and playwright who wrote in both English and Irish. He was also an Irish republican and a volunteer in the Irish Republican Army. Born in Dublin into a republican family, he became a member of the IRA's youth organisation Fianna Éireann at the age of fourteen. However, there was also a strong emphasis on Irish history and culture in the home, which meant he was steeped in literature and patriotic ballads from a tender age. Behan eventually joined the IRA at sixteen, which led to him serving time in a borstal youth prison in the United Kingdom and was also imprisoned in Ireland. During this time, he took it upon himself to study and he became a fluent speaker of the Irish language. Subsequently released from prison as part of a general amnesty given by the Fianna Fáil government in 1946, Behan moved between homes in Dublin, Kerry and Connemara and also resided in Paris for a period.  In 1954, Behan's first play ""The Quare Fellow"" was produced in Dublin. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation - this was helped by a famous drunken interview on BBC television. In 1958, Behan's play in the Irish language ""An Giall"" had its debut at Dublin's Damer Theatre. Later, ""The Hostage"", Behan's English-language adaptation of ""An Giall"", met with great success internationally. Behan's autobiographical novel, ""Borstal Boy"", was published the same year and became a worldwide bestseller. He married Beatrice Ffrench-Salkeld in 1955. Behan was known for his drink problem, which resulted in him suffering from diabetes, which ultimately resulted in his death on 20 March 1964. He was given an IRA guard of honour which escorted his coffin and it was described by several newspapers as the biggest funeral since those of Michael Collins and Charles Stewart Parnell. Biography. Early life. Behan was born in the inner city of Dublin on 9 February 1923 into an educated working-class family. He lived in a house on Russell Street near Mountjoy Square owned by his grandmother, Christine English, who owned a number of properties in the area. Brendan's father Stephen Behan, a house painter who had been active in the Irish War of Independence, read classic literature to the children at bedtime from sources such as Zola, Galsworthy, and Maupassant; his mother, Kathleen, took them on literary tours of the city. If Behan's interest in literature came from his father, his political beliefs came from his mother. She remained politically active all her life and was a personal friend of the Irish republican Michael Collins. Brendan Behan wrote a lament to Collins, ""The Laughing Boy"", at the age of thirteen. The title was from the affectionate nickname Mrs. Behan gave to Collins. Kathleen published her autobiography, ""Mother of All The Behans,"" a collaboration with her son Brian, in 1984. Behan's uncle Peadar Kearney wrote the Irish national anthem ""Amhrán na bhFiann"". His brother, Dominic Behan, was also a renowned songwriter best known for the song ""The Patriot Game""; another sibling, Brian Behan, was a prominent radical political activist and public speaker, actor, author, and playwright. Brendan and Brian did not share the same views, especially when the question of politics or nationalism arose. Brendan on his deathbed (presumably in jest) asked Cathal Goulding (Behan's half-brother following a relationship between Stephen Behan and Goulding's mother), then the Chief of Staff of the IRA, to ""have that bastard Brian shot—we've had all sorts in our family, but never a traitor!"" A biographer Ulick O'Connor, recounts that one day, at the age of eight, Brendan was returning home with his granny and a crony from a drinking session. A passer-by remarked, ""Oh, my! Isn't it terrible ma'am to see such a beautiful child deformed?"" ""How dare you,"" said his granny. ""He's not deformed, he's just drunk!"" Behan left school at 13 to follow in his father's footsteps as a house painter. Republican activities. In 1937, the family moved to a new local authority housing scheme in Crumlin. Behan became a member of Fianna Éireann, the youth organization of the IRA. He published his first poems and prose in the organisation's magazine, ""Fianna: the Voice of Young Ireland"". In 1931 he also became the youngest contributor to be published in the ""Irish Press"" with his poem ""Reply of Young Boy to Pro-English verses"". At sixteen, Behan joined the IRA and embarked on an unauthorised solo mission to England to blow up the Liverpool docks. He was arrested and found in possession of explosives. Behan was sentenced to three years in a borstal and did not return to Ireland until 1941. He wrote about these years in his autobiography, ""Borstal Boy"". In 1942, during the timeframe leading to the IRA's Northern Campaign, Behan was tried for the attempted murder of two Detectives of the Garda Siochana. The assassinations were to take place in Dublin while at a commemoration ceremony for Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish Republicanism. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, he was incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison and the Curragh Camp. These experiences were recalled in ""Confessions of an Irish Rebel."" Released under a general amnesty for IRA prisoners and internees in 1946, his activist career was over by the age of twenty-three. Aside from a short prison sentence he received in 1947 for his part in trying to break a fellow IRA member out of a Manchester jail, he effectively left the IRA, though he remained great friends with Cathal Goulding. Behan the writer. Behan's prison experiences were central to his future writing career. In Mountjoy he wrote his first play, ""The Landlady"", and also began to write short stories and other prose. It was a literary magazine called ""Envoy"" (A Review of Literature and Art), founded by John Ryan, that first published Behan's short stories and his first poem. Some of his early work was also published in ""The Bell,"" the leading Irish literary magazine of the time. He also learned Irish in prison and, after his release in 1946, he spent some time in the Gaeltacht areas of Galway and Kerry, where he started writing poetry in Irish. He left Ireland and all its perceived social pressures to live in Paris in the early 1950s. There he felt he could lose himself and release the artist within. Although he still drank heavily, he managed to earn a living, supposedly by writing pornography. By the time he returned to Ireland, he had become a writer who drank too much, rather than a drinker who talked about what he was going to write. He had also developed the knowledge that in order to succeed, he would have to discipline himself. Throughout the rest of his writing career, he would rise at seven in the morning and work until noon—when the pubs opened. He began to write for various newspapers, such as ""The Irish Times,"" and also for radio, which broadcast a play of his entitled ""The Leaving Party"". Additionally, he cultivated a reputation as carouser-in-chief and swayed shoulder-to-shoulder with other literati of the day that he had got to know through Envoy and who used the pub, McDaid's, as their base: Flann O'Brien, Patrick Kavanagh, Patrick Swift, Anthony Cronin, J. P. Donleavy and artist Desmond MacNamara whose bust of Behan is on display at the National Writers Museum. For unknown reasons Behan had a major falling-out with Kavanagh, who reportedly would visibly shudder at the mention of Behan's name and who referred to Behan as ""evil incarnate"". Behan's fortunes changed in 1954 with the appearance of his play ""The Quare Fellow""—his major breakthrough at last. Originally called ""The Twisting of Another Rope"" and influenced by his time spent in jail, it chronicles the vicissitudes of prison life leading up to the execution of ""the quare fellow""—a character who is never seen. The prison dialogue is vivid and laced with satire, but reveals to the reader the human detritus that surrounds capital punishment. It was produced in the Pike Theatre in Dublin. The play ran for six months. In May 1956, ""The Quare Fellow"" opened in the Theatre Royal Stratford East, in a production by Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. Subsequently it transferred to the West End. Behan generated immense publicity for ""The Quare Fellow"" as a result of a drunken appearance on the Malcolm Muggeridge TV show. The English, relatively unaccustomed to public drunkenness in authors, took him to their hearts. A fellow guest on the show, Irish-American actor Jackie Gleason, reportedly said about the incident: ""It wasn't an act of God, but an act of Guinness!"" Behan and Gleason went on to forge a friendship. Brendan loved the story of how, walking along the street in London shortly after this episode, a Cockney approached him and exclaimed that he understood every word he had said—drunk or not—but had not a clue what ""that bugger Muggeridge was on about!"" While addled, Brendan would clamber on stage and recite the play's signature song ""The Auld Triangle"". The transfer of the play to Broadway provided Behan with international recognition. Rumours still abound that Littlewood's hand was all over ""The Quare Fellow"" and led to the saying, ""Dylan Thomas wrote Under Milk Wood, Brendan Behan wrote under Littlewood"". She remained a supporter, visiting him in Dublin in 1960. In 1957, his Irish language play, ""An Giall"" (""The Hostage"") opened in the Damer Theatre, Dublin. Reminiscent of Frank O'Connor's Guests of the Nation, it portrays the detention, in a teeming Dublin house in the late 1950s, of a British conscript soldier seized by the IRA as a hostage pending the scheduled execution in Northern Ireland of an imprisoned IRA volunteer. The hostage falls in love with an Irish convent girl, Teresa, working as a maid in the house. Their innocent world of love is incongruous among their surroundings—the house also serves as a brothel. In the end, the hostage dies accidentally during a bungled police raid, revealing the human cost of war—a universal suffering. The subsequent English-language version ""The Hostage"" (1958), reflecting Behan's own translation from the Irish, but also much influenced by Joan Littlewood during a troubled collaboration with Behan, is a bawdy, slapstick play that adds a number of flamboyantly gay characters and bears only a limited resemblance to the original Irish language version. His autobiographical novel ""Borstal Boy"" followed in 1958. In this vivid memoir of his time in Hollesley Bay Borstal, Suffolk, England, an original voice in Irish literature boomed out from its pages. The language is both acerbic and delicate, the portrayal of inmates and ""screws"" cerebral. For a Republican, though, it is not a vitriolic attack on Britain; it delineates Behan's move away from violence. In one account an inmate strives to entice Brendan in chanting political slogans with him. Brendan curses and damns him in his mind, hoping he would cease his rantings-hardly the sign of a troublesome prisoner. By the end the idealistic boy rebel emerges as a realistic young man who recognises the truth: violence, especially political violence, is futile. Kenneth Tynan, the 1950s literary critic said: ""While other writers hoard words like misers, Behan sends them out on a spree, ribald, flushed, and spoiling for a fight."" He was now established as one of the leading Irish writers of his generation. He learned to speak Irish at the home of the Nolan family in the Gaeltacht area of Galway in the late 1940s. Drs Sinead and Maureen Nolan (daughters of the house) never heard a disrespectful word or a hint of obscenity from him during that time. He was much loved and revered by their deeply religious parents, who recognized his genius for language early. They saw his theatrics for what it was: a cover up for an exquisitely sensitive nature. In the end his favourite drink (a lethal combination for a diabetic) was champagne and sherry. Decline and death. Behan found fame difficult. He had long been a heavy drinker (describing himself, on one occasion, as ""a drinker with a writing problem"" and claiming ""I only drink on two occasions—when I'm thirsty and when I'm not"") and developed diabetes in the early 1960s. As his fame grew, so too did his alcohol consumption. This combination resulted in a series of famously drunken public appearances, on both stage and television. Brendan saw that it paid to be drunk; the public wanted the witty, iconoclastic, genial ""broth of a boy,"" and he gave that to them in abundance, exclaiming: ""There's no bad publicity except an obituary."" His health suffered terribly, with diabetic comas and seizures occurring regularly. Towards the end he became the caricature of the drunken Irishman. The public who once extended their arms now closed ranks against him; publicans flung him from their premises. Although Brendan cried out that he was a writer, inside he knew his fears had materialised—he was unable to generate another classic. His last two books, ""Brendan Behan's Island"" and ""Brendan Behan's New York"", published in 1962 and 1964 respectively, were talk books and cannot be compared to his former works. They were littered with pretentiousness and sycophancy, neither of which he would have tolerated earlier: ""As Norman Mailer said to me..."" Arthur Miller came up to me..."" ""One day with Groucho Marx..."" Both works were tape-recorded, which Brendan hated. He preferred to write longhand or to type. Behan had married Beatrice Salkeld (the daughter of painter Cecil Salkeld) in 1955. A daughter, Blanaid, was born in 1963. Love, however, was not enough to bring Behan back from his alcoholic abyss. By early March 1964, the end was in sight. Collapsing at the Harbour Lights bar, he was transferred to the Meath Hospital in central Dublin, where he died, aged 41. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, where he received an Irish Republican Army funeral. En route to the graveyard, thousands lined the streets. References in popular culture. Behan is frequently mentioned in works of popular culture. His work has been a significant influence in the writings of Shane MacGowan, and he is the subject of ""Streams Of Whiskey"", a song by The Pogues. Behan is also mentioned in The Pogues's song ""Thousands Are Sailing"" (written by Philip Chevron), with reference to the experience of Irish immigrants in New York. The quote ""Compliments pass when the quality meet"", taken from Behan's book ""Borstal Boy"", is used in The Pogues's song ""Sea Shanty"" (written by Shane MacGowan). Behan's version of the third verse of ""The Internationale"", from ""Borstal Boy"", was reproduced on the LP sleeve of Dexys Midnight Runners's debut album, ""Searching for the Young Soul Rebels"". In Dexys Midnight Runners's first single, ""Dance Stance"" (a/k/a ""Burn It Down""), a top 40 hit in the UK, Behan is named among other Irish writers in the song's chorus. Behan and his work have also featured in the music of other artists. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones song ""All Things Considered"" features the lyric ""He swears that he was there the day that Brendan Behan died"". The Thin Lizzy song ""Black Rose"" features the lyric ""Ah sure, Brendan where have you Behan?"" Bob Geldof's song ""Thinking Voyager 2 Type Things"" features the lyric ""So rise up Brendan Behan like a drunken Lazarus"". A House mention Behan in their song ""Endless Art"". Damien Dempsey mentions Behan in ""Jar Song"". Behan is mentioned in the Pete St John song about Dublin life made famous by The Dubliners, ""The Mero"": ""It's Brendan Behan out walking, Sure he's a ginger man."" Chicago-based band The Tossers wrote the song ""Breandan O Beachain"", found on their 2008 album ""On A Fine Spring Evening"". The Mahones mention Behan in the song ""Draggin' the Days"". The Mountain Goats song ""Commandante"" opens with the line: ""I'm gonna drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan"". Shortly after Behan's death a young student, Fred Geis, wrote the song ""Lament for Brendan Behan"" and passed it on to the Clancy Brothers, who sang it on their album ""Recorded Live in Ireland!"" the same year. This song, which calls ""bold Brendan"" Ireland's ""sweet angry singer"", was later covered by the Australian trio The Doug Anthony All Stars, better known as a comedy band, on their album ""Blue"". ""Brendan"" is Seamus Robinson's song-tribute to Behan. Behan's prisoner song ""The Auld Triangle"", (which was written by his brother Dominic and featured in his play ""The Quare Fellow""—this term being prison slang for a prisoner condemned to be hanged), has become something of a standard and has been recorded on numerous occasions, by folk musicians as well as popular bands such as The Pogues, the Dropkick Murphys and The Doug Anthony All Stars. Behan's two poems from his work ""The Hostage"", ""On the eighteenth day of November"" and ""The laughing boy"" have been translated into Swedish and recorded by Ann Sofi Nilsson on the album ""När kommer dagen"". The same poems have been translated in 1966 to Greek and recorded by Maria Farantouri on the album ""Ένας όμηρος"" ( the hostage) by Mikis Theodorakis. Behan is mentioned as an alcoholic muse in the film ""Divorcing Jack"": ""...as my artistic interests grew I found that many of my heroes had had impassioned affairs with what my old dar would say was the devils vomit. Brendan Behan, Dylan Thomas, George Best, Pete Townshend... It had not adversely affected any of them, with the exception of the first two. 'em it killed."" Also, one of his books, ""Confessions of an Irish Rebel"", is burnt in the film version of Ray Bradbury's novel ""Fahrenheit 451"". A pub named for Behan is located in the historically Irish Jamaica Plain section of Boston, Massachusetts. A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street. There are two stories associated with him (both of which were in the A Series of ""QI"", in the episode entitled ""Advertising"".) One states that he was visiting Canada and he was asked by a reporter ""What brings you to Canada, Mr Behan?"" To which Behan is supposed to have replied ""Well now, I was in a bar in Dublin and it had one of those coasters, and it said ""Drink Canada Dry"", so I thought I'd give it a shot."" The second story states that he would write a slogan for Guinness if he were given a few crates of the product. The next day, the advertisers from Guinness returned to find the crates empty, surrounded by bits of crumpled paper, and he said ""I've got it: 'Guinness makes you drunk'."" According to J.P. Donleavy's ""History of The Ginger Man"", Behan was instrumental in bringing Donleavy in contact with M. Girodios of Olympia Press (Paris) in order to help Donleavy's famous first novel, ""The Ginger Man"" be published despite its having been ostracized by the world literature community for its ""filth"" and ""obscenity"". Donleavy also alludes to the fact that Behan lent assistance to the Russian Nabokov in getting ""Lolita"" published in a similar fashion. He was mentioned in the ""Preacher"" comics by Garth Ennis when the vampire Cassidy claimed to have known him in the 1950s. Ennis also created a Behan analogue in ""Hellblazer"", who purportedly sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for a collection of the finest drink known to man, and was characterized by a penchant for quoting poetry and literature during casual conversation. In May 2011, ""Brendan at the Chelsea"", written by Behan's niece, Janet Behan, was the first play performed in the Naughton Studio at the new Lyric Theatre in Belfast. The production tells the story of Behan's residence at New York's Hotel Chelsea in 1963. It was a critical success and is being revived for a tour to Theatre Row in New York in September 2013 before returning to the Lyric in October 2013. As to the visual arts, Behan is a favorite subject of London Irish painter Brian Whelan. Whelan's 2013 portrait has Behan at table with drink and fag in hand. "
wikipedia-389497," Peter Costello  Peter Howard Costello, AC (born 14 August 1957), is an Australian former politician and lawyer who served as the Treasurer in the Australian Howard Government from 1996 to 2007. He is the longest-serving Treasurer in Australia's history. Costello was a Member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1990 to 2009, representing the Division of Higgins. He also served as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party from 1994 to 2007. On 18 September 2008, Costello was appointed as chairman of the World Bank's new Independent Advisory Board (IAB) to provide advice on anti-corruption measures. Early life. Costello was born on 14 August 1957 in Melbourne into a middle-class family of practising Christians. He was the second of three children: his elder brother, Tim Costello, is a prominent Baptist minister and current CEO of World Vision Australia. Costello was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School and Monash University, where he graduated with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. Costello is a decedent of Leitrim, Ireland-born publican and disgrace politician Patrick Costello, who was expelled from the Parliament of Victoria. During the 1980s, Costello was a solicitor at the law firm Mallesons Stephen Jaques, then became a barrister and represented employers in some of Australia's best known industrial relations disputes. In 1983 and 1984, Costello represented the National Farmers' Federation in a case against the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU). The AMIEU was seeking a unit tally system to be set up in abattoirs in the Northern Territory. The dispute focussed on one abattoir, Mudginberri, which chose to fight the AMIEU claim. Ultimately the AMIEU claim was unsuccessful. Costello became counsel to organisations representing small business and rose to prominence in the 1985 Dollar Sweets case, as junior counsel assisting Alan Goldberg QC, successfully representing a confectionery company involved in a bitter industrial dispute. Political background. During his student years, Costello was active in student politics. For a time, he was an office-bearer of the Social Democratic Students Association of Victoria, an affiliate of the Balaclava Branch of Australian Young Labor. In 1977, Costello was assaulted by a left-wing student politician, receiving mainstream media attention for the first time in his career as a result. After graduating, Costello became more conservative but retained liberal views on some social issues. In 1984 he was a founding member of the H. R. Nicholls Society, a think tank on industrial relations. In the late 1980s, he was identified as part of the New Right movement, which was organised to some extent in the H. R. Nicholls Society. Political career. Early political career. In 1990, Costello defeated sitting member Roger Shipton in a preselection ballot for the comfortably safe Liberal electorate of Higgins, the seat once held by Harold Holt. He entered the House of Representatives at the age of 32. Costello made his maiden speech in May 1990 and mentioned ""government should be subservient to the citizen; the Executive accountable to the representative parliament; and the monopoly give way in the face of the individual."" He was immediately promoted to the Opposition front bench and proved an effective debater against the Labor government of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. By 1992 he was shadow Attorney-General, and in 1993 he became shadow Finance Minister under Dr John Hewson. Hewson's shock defeat at the 1993 election brought Costello into consideration as a leadership contender. Costello's profile became higher after the ""sports rorts affair"" with Sport Minister Ros Kelly: after revealing Kelly did not handle funding properly for the policy, Hewson and Costello demanded she resign, and she did. Hewson was deposed as Liberal leader in May 1994, Costello supported Alexander Downer for the leadership, becoming his Deputy Leader and shadow Treasurer. What may have prevented Costello from challenging Hewson for the leadership himself was that it would have proven correct an accusation by Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett that Costello and his friend, former Victorian Liberal party president Michael Kroger, of undermining Hewson's leadership prior to Hewson calling the leadership spill which partly occurred because of Costello in the first place. However, Downer resigned in January 1995. Costello did not seek the leadership, instead supporting John Howard. It was revealed in July 2006 that this was due to a December 1994 meeting between Howard, Costello and Ian McLachlan during which Howard allegedly agreed to stand aside after one and a half terms as Prime Minister in return for Costello's agreement not to challenge for the leadership. Howard denied that this was a formal arrangement. Hewson noted with irony in 2009 that Costello's best chances of becoming leader were at the 1994 leadership spill or when Downer stood down, several months later. As Deputy Leader until 2007, he was the longest serving in that role, achieving that status in 2006 after breaking the record of the party's first Deputy Leader Sir Eric Harrison. He also spent all but the last two years of his career on the front bench. Federal Treasurer (1996–2007). The Liberal/National coalition headed by Howard won the 1996 election, defeating the Keating government on a 29-seat swing. and Costello became Federal Treasurer at age 38. He oversaw the return to and maintenance of federal budget surpluses, which enabled significant reduction in government debt. Costello brought down twelve consecutive Federal Budgets, including ten surpluses. During this period he eliminated the Commonwealth Government net debt of $96 billion. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment all fell and remained generally low during Costello's term as Treasurer. Tax reform became a major policy focus for Costello. Although John Howard had promised during the 1996 election campaign that he would ""never, ever"" introduce a GST, it returned as Liberal Party policy for the 1998 election. It was passed through the Senate with the help of the Australian Democrats. Until July 2005, Costello's own agenda of labour market deregulation remained blocked by the government's lack of a Senate majority. In 1998, Costello and his wife Tanya, along with Tony Abbott and his wife Margaret, successfully sued author Bob Ellis for false statements he made about them in his book ""Goodbye Jerusalem"". Costello advocated for change to a republic at the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998. He rejected any suggestion that Australia was not already an independent nation and said that the Australian Constitution works ""remarkably well"". It was the institution of monarchy that was the crux of his argument for change: Costello supported the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic. However, he has also stated, at a Liberal and National Party gathering in 1992 in company with John Sharp MP, that he would support an Australia-based system of constitutional monarchy, in which a member of the House of Windsor would be invited to relocate to Australia and serve as the monarch of Australia, in place of the current system in which the crowns of Australia and the United Kingdom are both held by the same individual.  After the 2001 election, he attracted criticism for not securing funding for a key election promise to extend the Medicare safety net. In February 2006, Costello caused controversy during a lecture at the Sydney Institute when questioned about the government's refusal to legally recognise same-sex marriage. He stated, ""I think we do recognise the rights of gay and lesbian people in Australia. We do not criminalise conduct or behaviour."" He also pointed out that the law was changed in 2004 to recognise same-sex couples with regards to superannuation. He stated that marriage should only be recognised between heterosexual couples. Also during the same speech, Costello criticised ""mushy misguided multiculturalism,"" warning immigrants that the acceptance of Australian values was ""not optional."" Leadership aspirations. Under Howard. Costello expected to gain the Liberal leadership some time during Howard's second term as Prime Minister, as per Howard's alleged December 1994 offer. When this did not eventuate, he showed signs of frustration and was visibly disappointed when Howard announced, in July 2003, his intention to lead the government into the 2004 election. During the 2004 election campaign, Howard avoided saying whether he would serve a full term if re-elected, saying only he would remain as long as his party supported him. The government's subsequent success in winning control of the Senate raised further speculation that Howard would delay his retirement, and the prospect of a Costello leadership succession appeared to recede. In July 2006, the alleged Costello/Howard succession deal was made public by Ian McLachlan. Costello confirmed the incident had occurred and that he shared McLachlan's interpretation of events. Howard denied the claims repeatedly, stating the continued public drama displayed ""hubris and arrogance"" and that the leadership was the party room's to decide, not a prize to be handed over by leaders to successors. Press Gallery columnist Michelle Grattan described Costello's actions : Despite tensions between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, nothing further came of those events. Neither Howard nor Costello took any action to remove the other from office, or resign. However, on 12 September 2007, amid renewed leadership tensions and a series of unfavourable public polls, Howard confirmed he would step aside well into the next term, if re-elected, and that Costello would be his ""logical successor"". A federal election was held on 24 November 2007. An exit poll of 2,787 voters by Auspoll, commissioned by Sky News, included a question on the statement ""I don’t want Peter Costello to become Prime Minister"". Fifty-nine per cent agreed, while 41 per cent disagreed. The Coalition lost the election. In opposition (2007–2009). Costello was widely expected to assume the Liberal leadership after the 2007 election, but the day after the election, in a surprise announcement, he said that he would not seek or accept the leadership or deputy leadership of the Liberal Party. This was after John Howard, in his concession speech on the night of the election, specifically endorsed Costello as the next leader for the Coalition. A week later, he indicated that he would be unlikely to serve out in full his parliamentary term of three years. However, as opposition leader Brendan Nelson struggled, speculation mounted that Costello would change his mind and seek the leadership. In August 2008, he ruled out challenging Nelson, but did not comment on the prospect of Nelson stepping aside in his favour. Finally in September 2008, just before the release of his memoirs, ""The Costello Memoirs"", Costello specifically re-confirmed that he would not be seeking leadership of the party and would leave politics at a time that suited him. Media attention immediately shifted to whether Costello's decision cleared the way for a leadership challenge by Malcolm Turnbull (who was the shadow treasurer at the time). Tony Abbott described the decision as a great loss to Australia and to Costello himself, who might continue to have regrets for the rest of his life at what might have been. Media outlets capitalised on Costello's failure to categorically rule out any future leadership challenge. An incumbent-announced leadership spill on the morning of Costello's book release saw Turnbull defeat Nelson. Costello remained as an opposition backbencher. On 18 September 2008, Costello was appointed to the World Bank’s new Independent Advisory Board, (IAB), which will provide advice on anti-corruption measures. On 15 June 2009, Costello announced that he would retire from Parliament at the next Federal election. However on 7 October 2009, Costello announced he would be resigning from Parliament when it resumed later in the month. He resigned on 19 October 2009, triggering the 2009 Higgins by-election. Post-political career. Costello is a member of the Board of Guardians of the Australian Government Future Fund since December 2009. Amidst some controversy it was announced that David Gonski would succeed the inaugural Chairman, David Murray when Murray's term expired on 3 April 2012. Gonski's appointment was in spite of an independent review (that was conducted by Gonski). Gonski reported to the Australian Government that the existing Guardians favoured Costello to succeed Murray as Chairman. Costello is a managing partner of BKK Partners, a boutique corporate advisory run by former Goldman Sachs JBWere managers. He also chairs the advisory board of specialist corporate advisory firm ECG Advisory Solutions. In 2008, his best-selling memoir was published by Melbourne University Press. Costello writes a regular column for Fairfax newspapers.  In October 2010, Howard published a memoir, """", that drew the ire of Costello and others. Howard used the memoir to settle some personal scores, calling Costello ""an elitist, who's unable to connect to ordinary Australians"" and accuses Costello of bungling the leadership handover issue. Costello responded by claiming that Howard ""appears to be incapable of taking responsibility for the defeat of the government and for losing his seat of Bennelong."" In May 2012, Michael Kroger accused Costello of being interested in returning to Federal Parliament, most likely by getting a Liberal MP to step aside, with the hope of becoming leader of the Liberal Party. Costello denied this, saying that Kroger had approached him asking to help preserve his ex-wife Helen Kroger's Senate position. At around the same time, Helen Kroger was demoted on the Senate Liberal ticket for Victoria. Kroger believes Costello was targeting her along with others; Kroger also claimed Costello very often criticises past and present Liberal party MPs and officials. Honours. On 26 January 2011, Peter Costello was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for ""for eminent service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly through the development of landmark economic policy reforms in the areas of taxation, foreign investment, superannuation and corporate regulation, and through representative roles with global financial organisations"". "
wikipedia-389504," Caiaphas  Joseph Caiaphas, known simply as Caiaphas () in the New Testament, was the Jewish high priest who is said to have organized the plot to kill Jesus. Caiaphas is also said to have been involved in the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. According to the Gospel accounts, Caiaphas was the major antagonist of Jesus. An ossuary with the name ""Joseph son of Caiaphas"" was found in Jerusalem in 1990. The authenticity of that discovery has been challenged by some scholars on various grounds. Account in Josephus. The 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus is considered the most reliable literary source for Caiaphas. His works contain information on the dates for Caiaphas's tenure of the high priesthood, along with reports on other high priests, and also help to establish a coherent description of the responsibilities of the high-priestly office. Josephus (""Antiquitates Judaicae"" 18.33-35) relates that Caiaphas became a high priest during a turbulent period. He also states that the proconsul Vitellius deposed him (""Antiquitates Judaicae"" 18.95-97). Josephus' account is based on an older source in which incumbents of the high priesthood were listed chronologically. According to Josephus, Caiaphas was appointed in AD 18 by the Roman prefect who preceded Pontius Pilate, Valerius Gratus. The terms of Annas, Caiaphas, and the five brothers are: Caiaphas and Miriam ossuaries. Caiaphas ossuary. In November 1990, an ornate limestone ossuary was found while paving a road in the Peace Forest south of the Abu Tor neighborhood of Jerusalem. This ossuary appeared authentic and contained human remains. An Aramaic inscription on the side was thought to read ""Joseph son of Caiaphas"" and on the basis of this the bones of an elderly man were considered to belong to the High Priest Caiaphas. Since the original discovery this identification has been challenged by some scholars on various grounds, including the spelling of the inscription, the lack of any mention of Caiaphas's status as High Priest, the plainness of the tomb (although the ossuary itself is as ornate as might be expected from someone of his rank and family), and other reasons. Miriam ossuary. In June 2011, archaeologists from Bar-Ilan University and Tel Aviv University announced the recovery of a stolen ossuary, plundered from a tomb in the Valley of Elah. The Israel Antiquities Authority declared it authentic, and expressed regret that it couldn't be studied ""in situ"". It is inscribed with the text: ""Miriam, daughter of Yeshua, son of Caiaphas, Priest of Ma’aziah from Beth ‘Imri"". Based on it, Caiaphas can be assigned to the priestly course of Ma’aziah, instituted by king David. New Testament. Matthew: trial of Jesus. In Matthew , Caiaphas, other chief priests, and the Bet Shammai dominated Sanhedrin of the time are depicted interrogating Jesus. They are looking for ""false evidence"" with which to frame Jesus, but are unable to find any. Jesus remains silent throughout the proceedings until Caiaphas demands that Jesus say whether he is the Christ. Jesus replies ""You have said so"" (Σὺ εἶπας) , and ""I am: and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."" Caiaphas and the other men charge him with blasphemy and order him beaten. John: relations with Romans. In John , the high priests call a gathering of the Sanhedrin in reaction to the raising of Lazarus. Later Caiaphas and the chief priests extend this decision to also include Lazarus himself . The parallel with the reaction of the ""five brothers"" to any raising of Lazarus in the account has given rise to the suggestion, by the Abbé Drioux and others, that the ""rich man"" is itself an attack on Caiaphas, his father-in-law, and his five brothers-in-law. Caiaphas considers, with ""the Chief Priests and Pharisees"", what to do about Jesus, whose influence was spreading. They worry that if they ""let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation."" Caiaphas makes a political calculation, suggesting that it would be better for ""one man"" (Jesus) to die than for ""the whole nation"" to be destroyed. In John , Jesus is brought before Annas and Caiaphas and questioned, with intermittent beatings. Afterward, the other priests (Caiaphas does not accompany them) take Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, and insist upon Jesus' execution. Pilate tells the priests to judge Jesus themselves, to which they respond they lack authority to do so. Pilate questions Jesus, after which he states, ""I find no basis for a charge against him."" Pilate then offers the gathered crowd the choice of one prisoner to release — said to be a Passover tradition — and they choose a criminal named Barabbas instead of Jesus. Political implications. Caiaphas was the son-in-law of Annas by marriage to his daughter and ruled longer than any high priest in New Testament times. For Jewish leaders of the time, there were serious concerns about Roman rule and an insurgent Zealot movement in Beit Shammai to eject the Romans from Israel. The Romans would not perform execution over violations of Jewish law, and therefore the charge of blasphemy would not have mattered to Pilate. Caiaphas' legal position, therefore, was to establish that Jesus was guilty not only of blasphemy, but also of proclaiming himself the messiah, which was understood as the return of the Davidic king. This would have been an act of sedition and prompted Roman execution. Acts: Peter and John refuse to be silenced. Later, in Acts , Peter and John went before Annas and Caiaphas after having healed a crippled man. Caiaphas and Annas questioned the apostles' authority to perform such a miracle. When Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, answered that Jesus of Nazareth was the source of their power, Caiaphas and the other priests realized that the two men had no formal education yet spoke eloquently about the man they called their saviour. Caiaphas sent the apostles away, and agreed with the other priests that the word of the miracle had already been spread too much to attempt to refute, and instead the priests would need to warn the apostles not to spread the name of Jesus. However, when they gave Peter and John this command, the two refused, saying ""Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God. For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."" Caiaphas in other historical sources. According to Helen Catharine Bond, there may be some references to Caiaphas in the rabbinic literature. Caiaphas in literature and arts. Dante places Caiaphas in the 6th realm of the 8th circle of ""Inferno"", where hypocrites are punished in the afterlife: his punishment is to be eternally crucified across the hypocrites' path, who eternally step on him. Caiaphas is mentioned in the 19th verse of ""The Ballad of Reading Gaol"" by Oscar Wilde: ""He does not stare upon the air Through a roof of little glass; He does not pray with lips of clay For his agony to pass, Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek The kiss of Caiaphas"" Caiaphas is mentioned throughout the works of William Blake as a byword for a traitor or Pharisee. He is also shown as influencing Pontius Pilate in passing the death sentence against Jeshua in The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov. Portrayals. Actors who have portrayed Caiaphas include Guy Rolfe in Nicholas Ray's film ""King of Kings"" (1961), Juan Rodolfo Wilcock in Pier Paolo Pasolini's film ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" (1964), Martin Landau in George Stevens' film ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965), Bob Bingham in Norman Jewison's film ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (1973), Anthony Quinn in Franco Zeffirelli's television miniseries ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (1977), Mattia Sbragia in Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004), and Adrian Schiller in the TV Miniseries ""The Bible"" (2013). Caiaphas and his ossuary are the subject of Bob Hostetler's book ""The Bone Box"" (Howard Books, 2008). Etymology. The name ""Caiaphas"" has three possible origins: "
wikipedia-389512," Red Hand Commando  The Red Hand Commando (RHC) is a small loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland, which is closely linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). It is named after the Red Hand of Ulster. History. Formation. The RHC was formed in 1972 in the Shankill area of west Belfast by John McKeague (who was also involved with Tara) and colleagues from the Shankill Defence Association such as William ""Plum"" Smith. Membership was high in the Shankill and Sandy Row areas of Belfast, in Newtownabbey, as well as in parts of County Down. In 1972 the RHC agreed to become an integral part of the UVF. It kept its own structures but in 'operational' matters agreed to take its lead from the UVF and share weapons and personnel. The group was declared illegal in 1973. Paramilitary campaign. The RHC waged a paramilitary campaign from 1972 until the loyalist ceasefires of 1994. According to the Sutton database of deaths at the University of Ulster's CAIN project, the RHC has killed 13 people, including 12 civilians, and one of its own members. However, many attacks claimed by the RHC have been blamed on the UVF. The following is a timeline of RHC attacks that resulted in deaths and attacks in which RHC members were killed: Ceasefire and decommissioning. In October 1994, the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) declared a ceasefire on behalf of all loyalist paramilitary groups. The UVF and RHC supported the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and maintained a ceasefire from 1994 until (arguably) 2005. Galway-Jackson argues that the RHC declares its ceasefire remained intact from 1994 until full and final decommissioning in 2009. On 3 May 2007 the RHC and UVF declared it was officially ending its armed campaign. The organisation stated that it would keep its weapons but put them ""beyond reach"" and ""under the control of the UVF leadership, but not accessible for use by members"". The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) stated that this was unacceptable. In June 2009, after talks with the IICD, it was announced that the RHC and UVF had decommissioned their weapons before independent witnesses. The group is noted for using an Irish language motto ""Lámh Dearg Abú"" (Victory to the Red Hand) as opposed to a Latin motto as is common with most other Loyalist groups. "
wikipedia-389516," Red Hand Defenders  The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) are a loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed in 1998 by loyalists who opposed the Belfast Agreement and the loyalist ceasefires. Its members were drawn mostly from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). The name had first been used by Red Hand Commandos dissident Frankie Curry in 1996 and he was the leading figure in what was a somewhat unstructured organization until he was killed in 1999. It is named after the Red Hand of Ulster.  The RHD emerged when it claimed responsibility for a blast bomb attack on 7 September 1998 during a loyalist protest in Portadown. The loyalists had been protesting against the decision to ban the Orange Order from marching through the town's mainly Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist quarter (see Drumcree conflict). The attack killed a Catholic Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. Since then, the RHD has claimed responsibility for killing a further ten people. It has also claimed responsibility for many pipe bomb attacks, mostly on the homes of Catholics. One of the RHD's most notable attacks was the assassination of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson on 15 March 1999. She had represented alleged Irish republican paramilitaries, the family of Robert Hamill, and the Garvaghy Road Residents Association. Of the eleven people the RHD claimed to have killed, nine were civilians, one was a former UDA member and one was an RUC officer. Links with the wider loyalist movement. It has been alleged that the name ""Red Hand Defenders"" is merely a covername for members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) so the organizations can claim on the surface to have honored their ceasefire agreements. Similar accusations have been made regarding the name ""Orange Volunteers"", another loyalist paramilitary group that emerged in 1998. Interestingly, claims of responsibility by the RHD for certain attacks have overlapped with the Orange Volunteers. The Council on Foreign Relations indicates the membership of the RHD, LVF and Orange Volunteers likely overlap. These organizations are generally composed of young Protestant males from Northern Ireland.  McDonald (2001) characterizes the LVF and UDA ceasefire agreements as ""official fiction"". The LVF denies these claims, stating that its armed campaign has ended. LVF members were aware that any breach of the ceasefire could result in the return to jail for those paramilitary prisoners freed as part of the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998. This essentially served as an incentive for the groups to create a cover name. As a result, the actual existence of the RHD has consistently been called into question. Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald have argued that the RHC and the Orange Volunteers are both overseen by a Protestant fundamentalist preacher they identify only as the Pastor. The Pastor, a former associate of William McGrath, John McKeague and George Seawright and a long established British intelligence agent, is said by the authors to provide his own form of fundamentalist, Anti-Catholic Protestantism to the two groups fluid membership of young men, most of whom are also UDA or LVF members. Ideology and ""modus operandi"". The Red Hand Defenders uses violence toward the goal of maintaining British control in Northern Ireland. Like other loyalist groups, the RHD is an adversary of Irish republican paramilitaries and Irish nationalists who seek to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a united Ireland. In essence, Irish Catholic nationalists aspire to be part of the Republic of Ireland, while Protestant unionists wish to preserve their ties with Great Britain. The resulting long-term conflict in Northern Ireland is often referred to as ""The Troubles"". However, unlike the two biggest loyalist paramilitaries—the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force—the group fully opposes the peace process and peace agreements, including the Good Friday Agreement. Their tactics include shootings, bombings and arson, with victims often being Catholic civilians. However, the victimization of Catholics seems to be based on politics rather than religion. The religious emphasis nonetheless exacerbates the underlying political problems. The group’s ""soft"" civilian targets have included Catholic schools and Catholic postal workers, as well as homes and businesses. The weapons used by the RHD include homemade pipe bombs, handguns and grenades. The group does not appear to receive external aid. Notable attacks. The RHD emerged when it claimed responsibility for a blast bomb attack on 7 September 1998 during a loyalist protest in Portadown. The loyalists had been protesting against the decision to ban the Orange Order from marching through the town's mainly Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist quarter (see Drumcree conflict). The attack killed a Catholic Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. Since then, the RHD has claimed responsibility for killing a further ten people. Of the eleven people the RHD claimed to have killed, nine were civilians, one was a former UDA member and one was an RUC officer. The group admitted shooting to death a Catholic man, Brian Service, while he was walking home in North Belfast on 31 October 1998, and to an attack on a pub in West Belfast earlier that day.  One of the RHD's most notable attacks was the assassination of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson on 15 March 1999. She had represented alleged Irish republican paramilitaries, the family of Robert Hamill, and the Garvaghy Road Residents Association. Nelson had been working with Prime Minister Tony Blair toward resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. She had also testified in Washington, D.C. about the plight of attorneys who were subjected to harassment and threats for representing Irish nationalists. Nelson further informed that she and her family had received death threats. The killing of Nelson was a significant setback to the peace process due to a fear of the need for retaliation. Moreover, this killing was the first high-profile assassination since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  In August 2001, the RHD claimed responsibility for an attempted pipe-bomb attack on a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament and an attempted car bomb attack at a fair shortly thereafter where streets were filled with civilians, though both plots were thwarted by police. The RHD also claimed responsibility for the murder of a journalist named Martin O’Hagan in September 2001, who was shot to death while walking home from a pub with his wife. O’Hagan had previously been threatened by Ulster Volunteer Force brigadier Billy Wright, who became the leader of the LVF and was subsequently killed in the Maze Prison. The attack may have stemmed from the journalist’s report on alleged collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and security forces in Northern Ireland.  According to the U.S. Department of State, the RHD claimed responsibility for killing a total of five individuals in 2001. In 2002, the RHD claimed responsibility for the murders of a Catholic teenager and a Catholic postman (with the UDA and the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) also subsequently claiming responsibility for the attacks), and also bombed the home of a prison officer. On 16 January 2002, the RHD allegedly made a statement agreeing to ""stand down"" at the request of the UDA/UFF after threatening Catholic postal workers and teachers. The sincerity of the statement was immediately called into question. The RHD resumed its campaign a few months later with a nail-bomb attack on a well-known republican. The RHD successfully separated itself from the UDA in February 2003 with the murder of UDA member John Gregg, who had attempted to kill Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams almost 20 years before. The attack on Gregg may have stemmed from disapproval with the RHD that had been expressed by the UFF. The RHD is believed to have engaged in periodic bombings and shootings in 2003, and further claimed responsibility for an attack in September 2004. "
wikipedia-389524," Stanislav Grof  Stanislav Grof (born July 1, 1931) is a psychiatrist, one of the founders of the field of transpersonal psychology and a pioneering researcher into the use of non-ordinary states of consciousness for purposes of exploring, healing, and obtaining growth and insights into the human psyche. Grof received the VISION 97 award granted by the Foundation of Dagmar and Václav Havel in Prague on October 5, 2007. Biography. Grof is known for his early studies of LSD and its effects on the psyche—the field of psychedelic therapy. Building on his observations while conducting LSD research and on Otto Rank's theory of birth trauma, Grof constructed a theoretical framework for pre- and perinatal psychology and transpersonal psychology in which LSD trips and other powerfully emotional experiences were mapped onto a person's early fetal and neonatal experiences. Over time, this theory developed into an in-depth ""cartography"" of the deep human psyche. Following the suppression of legal LSD use in the late 1960s, Grof went on to discover that many of these states of mind could be explored without drugs by using certain breathing techniques in a supportive environment. He continues this work today under the title ""Holotropic Breathwork"". Grof received his M.D. from Charles University in Prague in 1957 and then completed his Ph.D. in medicine at the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences in 1965, training as a Freudian psychoanalyst at this time. In 1967, he was invited as an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, United States, and went on to become Chief of Psychiatric Research at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center where he worked with Walter Pahnke and Bill Richards among others. In 1973, he was invited to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, and lived there until 1987 as a scholar-in-residence, developing his ideas. As founding president of the International Transpersonal Association (founded in 1977), he went on to become distinguished adjunct faculty member of the Department of Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness at the California Institute of Integral Studies, a position he remains in today. Grof was featured in the film ""Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within"", a 2006 documentary about rediscovering an enchanted cosmos in the modern world. He was also featured in five other documentaries. Teachings. Grof distinguishes between two modes of consciousness: the ""hylotropic"" and the ""holotropic"". The ""hylotropic"" refers to ""the normal, everyday experience of consensus reality."" The ""holotropic"" refers to states which aim towards wholeness and the totality of existence. The holotropic is characteristic of non-ordinary states of consciousness such as meditative, mystical, or psychedelic experiences. According to Grof, these non-ordinary states are often categorized by contemporary psychiatry as psychotic. Grof connects the hylotropic to the Hindu conception of namarupa (""name and form""), the separate, individual, illusory self. He connects the holotropic to the Hindu conception of Atman-Brahman, the divine, true nature of the self. Grof believes that the holotropic mode has been uniquely de-emphasized in the modern West:All the cultures in human history except the Western industrial civilization have held holotropic states of consciousness in great esteem. They induced them whenever they wanted to connect to their deities, other dimensions of reality, and with the forces of nature. They also used them for diagnosing and healing, cultivation of extrasensory perception, and artistic inspiration. They spent much time and energy to develop safe and effective ways of inducing them.Grof connects modern man's inability to fully and honestly grapple with his psychic conflicts to the contemporary ecological crisis:In the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that humanity is facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions. Modern science has developed effective measures that could solve most of the urgent problems in today's world--combat the majority of diseases, eliminate hunger and poverty, reduce the amount of industrial waste, and replace destructive fossil fuels by renewable sources of clean energy. The problems that stand in the way are not of economical or technological nature. The deepest sources of the global crisis lie inside the human personality and reflect the level of consciousness evolution of our species.Grof conceives of the use of hallucinogenic drugs to be one method to overcome the West's peculiar aversion to holotropic consciousness:In one of my early books I suggested that the potential significance of LSD and other psychedelics for psychiatry and psychology was comparable to the value the microscope has for biology or the telescope has for astronomy. My later experience with psychedelics only confirmed this initial impression. These substances function as unspecific amplifiers that increase the cathexis (energetic charge) associated with the deep unconscious contents of the psyche and make them available for conscious processing. This unique property of psychedelics makes it possible to study psychological undercurrents that govern our experiences and behaviours to a depth that cannot be matched by any other method and tool available in modern mainstream psychiatry and psychology. In addition, it offers unique opportunities for healing of emotional and psychosomatic disorders, for positive personality transformation, and consciousness evolution. "
wikipedia-389538," Trenton Thunder  The Trenton Thunder are an American Minor League Baseball team and are the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. The Thunder play in the Eastern Division of the Eastern League, and are the current league champions. The Thunder's home stadium is Arm & Hammer Park in Trenton, New Jersey. Team history. The Trenton Thunder were founded in 1980 in Glens Falls, New York, as the Glens Falls White Sox. The team was affiliated with the Chicago White Sox from 1980-1984. The Detroit Tigers replaced the White Sox in 1985 with the team being renamed as the Glens Falls Tigers, and stayed on as a Tigers affiliate after the franchise moved to London, Ontario, in 1989, becoming the London Tigers and began playing at historic Labatt Park. In 1994, the London Tigers relocated to Trenton and became the Trenton Thunder. The team kept the Tigers affiliation for that season only, before switching affiliations to the Boston Red Sox in 1995. As a Red Sox affiliate, the club recorded three first-place finishes, but was eliminated from the playoffs in the first round each time. In 2003, the Thunder became the Yankees affiliate, and the Portland Sea Dogs became the new Red Sox affiliate. The switch reflected both teams' fanbases, as Central New Jersey is home to a large number of Yankees fans, while Maine is home to a large number of Red Sox fans. On June 4, 1994, Phil Stidham became the first Thunder alumnus to play in the major leagues, for the Detroit Tigers, giving up six runs on six hits, including two home runs, as part of a 21-7 romp by the Minnesota Twins. In , the Thunder became the first team in Minor League Baseball history to draw over 400,000 fans for 12 consecutive seasons, at the Double-A level or below. Through 13 seasons, over 5.4 million people had attended a Thunder game. Surpassing the previous mark of 8,729, set while Derek Jeter was on a rehab stint with the team, the Thunder set a new single-game attendance record on May 23, 2007, when 9,134 fans attended, to watch Roger Clemens make his second minor-league start, as he worked toward a return to the Yankees. On Sunday, July 3, 2011, a paid attendance of 9,212 set a new record, as Derek Jeter returned once again, for a rehab start. On September 15, 2007, the Thunder defeated the Akron Aeros to win their first Eastern League Championship Series in team history. Trenton defended its league title with 5-1 win over the Akron Aeros on September 14, 2008. The Thunder lost to the Altoona Curve in the 2010 Eastern League Championship Series. Notable alumni.

The Thunder's mascot is a blue ""Thunderbird"" named Boomer. He wears a Thunder uniform as well as purple and yellow shades. Boomer traditionally takes part in many of the promotions and activities throughout Thunder home games, such as a race around the bases against a young fan. Boomer's likeness has appeared on numerous pieces of merchandise, and he is involved with several programs assisting children in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Strike. Strike is the Thunder's newest mascot, debuting during the 2008 season. He is a yellow lightning bolt and his character is also depicted on the team's alternate caps. Strike can be seen all over Waterfront Park during a Thunder game, usually in tandem with Boomer, the Thunder's original mascot. Together Strike and Boomer take part in such in-game activities as shooting t-shirts off into the crowd, racing a youngster around the bases for a prize, and even competing against one another to pick the loudest section in the stadium on a given night. Strike's name was chosen via an online poll, as over 1,000 suggestions were made with ""Strike"" being the most popular name mentioned by the fans. Chase. Chase ""That Golden Thunder"" was a Golden Retriever who was part of the Thunder family from late in the 2002 season until his death in 2013. He often served as ""batdog"" during the first inning at most Thunder home games, retrieving bats and balls and returning them to the Thunder dugout. Contrary to popular belief, his teeth did not leave marks in the equipment, as Retrievers are trained to carry birds without puncturing them, however he did have a golden tooth, due to his bat carrying duties. Later in the game, Chase usually caught frisbees to win a cash prize for a lucky fan. Chase had garnered significant media attention, appearing on FOX, CNN, YES Network, UPN9, WNBC4, and even Japanese television. In 2008, Chase sired a litter of pups. One of the pups was trained to be his successor and was named Home Run Derby (or Derby for short) in a fan poll during the offseason. Another of the pups from that litter was named Ollie, and currently serves in a batdog capacity for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Chase died July 8, 2013 aged 13. He was diagnosed with cancer in February and had been suffering from arthritis. Ownership.

wikipedia-389540," Takenaka Corporation  The company's website also claims it to be the oldest firm of that type anywhere in the world, since the demise of Kongō Gumi which was substantially older. Both company originate from family of architect-carpenter (Miyadaiku). In 1610 Tobei Masataka Takenaka (竹中 藤兵衛正高), a shrine and temple carpenter, started a business in Nagoya. The business went on like a family business and built some of the first Western-style buildings during the last half of 19th century, most of them in Nagoya. In 1899 Toemon Takenaka (竹中 藤右衛門), 14th generation descendant of the original founder, established a branch office in Kobe and founded Takenaka Corporation as an official company. The company grew more and more during the 20th century, its capital in 1909 was about ¥100.000, ¥6 million in 1938, ¥1.5 billion in 1959 and ¥50 billion in 1979; nowadays, Takenaka Corporation is a multinational company with offices in 18 different countries. Its president is Toichi Takenaka (竹中 統一) (June 2004). The company is now regarded in Japan as one of the ""Big Five"" contractors ranked with Kajima, Obayashi, Shimizu and Taisei, and has a long history of designing buildings. The firm has built some of the most important buildings in Japan, including the Tokyo Tower, the Tokyo Dome (the first large-scale stadium with air-supported membrane roof in Japan), the Fukuoka Dome (Japan's first large-scale stadium with retractable roof), and the Kobe Meriken Park Oriental Hotel among others. Among its proposals is the Sky City 1000 project. "
wikipedia-389541," Johann Friedrich Fasch  Johann Friedrich Fasch (15 April 1688 – 5 December 1758) was a German violinist and composer. Fasch was born in Buttelstedt. He was a choirboy in Weissenfels and studied under Johann Kuhnau at the famous St. Thomas School in Leipzig and later founded a Collegium Musicum in that city. He then traveled throughout Germany, becoming a violinist in the orchestra in Bayreuth in 1714 and holding a court post in Greiz. Also in 1714, Fasch studied composition with Christoph Graupner in Darmstadt. In 1722 he was appointed ""Kapellmeister"" at Zerbst, a post he held until his death.  His works include cantatas, concertos, symphonies, and chamber music. None of his pieces were printed in his lifetime, and a large number of his vocal works, including four operas, have been lost. However, he was held in high regard by his contemporaries (Johann Sebastian Bach made manuscript copies of a number of his pieces), and he is today considered an important link between the Baroque and Classical periods. Fasch died in Zerbst at the age of 70. He was the father of Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch, also a musician of note. The city of Zerbst/Anhalt has been hosting International Festivals since 1983, biennially since 1993. The Twelfth International Fasch Festival will take place in Zerbst/Anhalt on 18 - 21 April 2013.  Works list. This listing is based on Rüdiger Pfeiffer's now out-dated ""Fasch Werke Verzeichnis."" The Internationale Fasch Gesellschaft e.V. has been working on a new online Fasch-Verzeichnis, which is now called Fasch-Repertorium. Its main contributor, Dr. Gottfried Gille, will be giving a paper on the project's progress at the upcoming international Fasch conference, held on the occasion of the twelfth International Fasch Festival (18-21 April 2013).
