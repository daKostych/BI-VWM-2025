wikipedia-3925334," Cubix  Cubix (Korean: 큐빅스; retitled 로보짱 큐빅스 for the KBS broadcast; subtitled Robots for Everyone in the United States) is a South Korean animated television series created by Cinepix. 4Kids Entertainment acquired the rights for an English adaption dub to the series in 2001, retaining them until their transfer to Saban Brands (a subsidiary of Saban Capital Group) in June 2012. Saban Brands currently owns and manages the copyright and branding of the English adaption of the series. Production. ""Cubix"" was created by the Korean company called Cinepix and licensed by 4Kids Entertainment in North America, and aired for two seasons during the Kids' WB! children’s block on The WB, lasting from August 11, 2001 to April 26, 2003; the series was later re-broadcast on FoxBox (owned by 4Kids Entertainment, later renamed 4KidsTV) from August 30, 2003 to January 2, 2005. Cubix is currently licensed by Saban Brands and aired on the Vortexx block on The CW, mainly to help provide their affiliates a half-hour of educational and informational programming credit. It was removed from the block after 4 weeks on September 22, 2012 and replaced with another episode of Rescue Heroes. Both seasons were broadcast in the UK on Cartoon Network UK. As of May 2010, the series is airing in the UK on kids' TV channel Pop. The show has been the theme of three video games: , , and . Many voice actors from this show also worked on the show, Pokemon. Plot and setting. ""Cubix"", set in the year 2044, is the story of a bright-eyed young boy named Connor with a deep fascination for robots. His father, Graham, who dislikes all robots, has never truly been supportive of Connor. As a surprise to his son, he purchases them a home and a small doughnut shop in the robot center of the world, Bubble Town, location of the RobixCorp headquarters. In this town, robots even outnumber people. The reason for RobixCorp's success is the EPU (Emotional Processing Unit), allowing robots to develop their own unique personality, just like a human being. Now that Connor's dream has finally come true, he finds himself with one great dilemma: everyone in Bubble Town owns a robot, that is, except him. Shortly after his arrival, he meets his nosy neighbor Abby who sends her little flying pet robot, Dondon, to spy on him and his dad. Graham, not being so fond of robots, conks Dondon over the head, knocking him out. A worried Abby, along with Connor, hop onto her hover scooter, rushing for the one place in town that can fix her friend: the Botties Pit. Operated by Hela, daughter of the famed inventor of the EPU and founder of RobixCorp, Professor Nemo, who has a special club for kids who can fix robots called 'The Botties', but to join, there's a test: you have to fix a robot in less than 24 hours. It is said that her father mysteriously vanished after an experiment with the highly volatile substance known as Solex. The members of the club include: Chip, his robot Cerebrix, Mong and Maximix, along with Abby and Dondon. Of all the robots he could have chosen to fix, Connor picks Cubix, a one-of-a-kind test model for the very first EPU. Unfortunately, they all called Cubix the 'Unfixable Robot' because at one time or another, they had all tried to repair him, especially Hela, who could never quite throw him out. After a sudden attack by Dr. K, an old colleague of Professor Nemo, who runs off with a stolen robot, the Botties' pit begins to crumble. But because of Connor's talent and thoughts projected into Cubix's EPU, he is brought back to life. Cubix then saves Connor from the collapse, proving that Connor could even fix the 'Unfixable Robot'. That wasn't the only surprise Cubix had in store; with his amazing design he can reconfigure and transform into virtually anything. Along with their new friends, Connor and Cubix face up against Dr. K to take back the kidnapped bot. This series follows the adventures and discoveries of the Botties gang, and their unraveling of Dr. K.'s crooked scheme along with the disappearance of Professor Nemo. Solex. Solex was said to have been discovered after an alien spacecraft crashed outside of RobixCorp, shortly before Prof. Nemo's disappearance. It has two forms: the glowing electric blue liquid form prone to random energy fluctuations and the second, more stable crystallized form used in most robots. The story suggests that it has a psychic nature as it reacts to sentient thoughts and emotions, even those of robot's EPUs. Solex in both liquid and crystallized form is capable of producing immense power. Solex in the 1st series. In the first season, Dr. K collects Solex from infected robots to utilize in his ultimate plan with the aid of the Alien, who uses the alter ego of Raska, the RobixCorp spokes model. It is suspected that the Solex was originally discovered by Professor Nemo but fearing the misuse of its power, separated the liquid Solex into small doses, placing them in random robots (or that the explosion in his lab the day he disappeared caused the Solex he was experimenting with to be transferred into the robots that were in his lab at the time). The liquid Solex, however, produces unexpected effects in robots; this is referred to as Solex infection. As the EPU is placed under heavy stress or emotions, the uncontrollable energy reaction of the liquid Solex causes them to malfunction and go berserk. Besides the behavioral malfunction, the infected robot also gains extreme power far beyond its normal capabilities. However, this extreme power could overload the host and cause self-destruction unless liquid Solex is removed, the robot is deactivated or the Solex energy returns to normal. Characters. The titular Cubix is a one of a kind robot built before Professor Nemo's disappearance, who is found deactivated with no visible damage, but no way to reactivate him either. He is introduced as part of Connor's initiation ceremony as the robot he chooses to fix. However, he cannot get Cubix to work until Dr. K appears to retrieve Solex from a robot. Connor brings Cubix back to life, just as the building they are in starts to crumble. His body is made out of a number of cubes, giving him a versatile modular function- by restructuring himself and using various gadgets within the cubes, he can transform into a hover bike, an airplane, a helicopter and plenty more. He can even fly without the need to transform into a vehicle. Hidden in each cube there is a different gadget with a solution to almost every dire situation. When it comes to fighting, Cubix is exceptionally strong, but often relies on his transformational ability and unorthodox strategies to win. He is powered by a generator that runs off crystallized Solex, which is rumored to be the ultimate power source, but nobody knows exactly how it works. Cubix's body is also constructed out of a highly resistant metal that is capable of withstanding devastating amounts of damage without breaking. He also has additional parts that when added to his structure can increase his strength. Cubix is a friendly and helpful robot, but lacks speech capability, while speaking seems to be common place among other robots. Usually he just repeats what people around him say, and uses the LED display where his eyes usually are to communicate emotions. However, later in the series this improves greatly and he becomes capable of forming sentences and dialogues, and once he regains the crystallized Solex at the finale, he regains the capacity for independent speech. Voiced by Scottie Ray. Humans. Botties. Connor: The main human character of the series, Connor is obsessed with robots. He moved to Bubble Town, and soon after joined the 'Botties' by fixing the 'Unfixable Robot', Cubix. Perpetually optimistic, yet kind of a hard head, he resents his dad for never answering questions about his late mother. He's best friends with Abby, as they often play 'virtual battle' video games at her house. Him and the Botties hang out at his dad's doughnut shop and Hela's repair shop, the Botties' Pitt. Voiced by Andrew Rannells. Abby: Connor's neighbor, best human friend, and fellow robot-lover, Abby was the first person to show Connor around Bubble Town. She's a member of the Botties and her pet robot, Dondon, has been her best friend since she was 6 years old. She's a little impatient and a bit of a procrastinator but she has a sweet compassionate side. Abby loves robots and looks up to Hela almost like a big sister, and secretly wishes to be just like her someday. She can often be found in her room studying robot repair manuals. Voiced by Veronica Taylor. Chip: He may be short but at only 10, he's probably the smartest of the Botties. He knows practically everything about robots. At times he can be a know-it-all who only sees things his way. He's actually very insecure about his height and can come across as awkward or nervous. His robot, Cerebrix is a specialized calculation model. He's best friends with Mong. Voiced by Amy Birnbaum. Mong: The taller and chunkier member of the Botties, Mong loves snacks and making jokes that only he ends up laughing at. He seems dense but he's actually pretty inventive and has a big heart. Highly competitive and a bit prideful, he rushes headlong into things, sometimes ignoring the consequences. His robot is Maximix, originally a fitness trainer model. Mong converted him into a motor bike. He's best friends with Chip. Voiced by Jimmy Zoppi. Hela Nemo: The daughter of Professor Nemo and the idol of Abby, she is the owner of the Botties Pit. Hela knows almost everything about robot repair. She's pretty even keeled, and is usually a source of advice and comfort to her young apprentices. Her robot team includes Diagnostix, Mr. Fixit, Ixpressive, and Attractix (named Kan-It). She also acts as a motherly figure to Connor and despite the arguments she has with his stubborn father it is joked about in the series that she likes him. Voiced by Rachael Lillis. Villains. Dr. K: The main villain of the series, Dr. K used to work for RobixCorp, but lost his arm in a lab explosion and now as a rogue robot inventor uses his smarts for evil. In Season 1 he's after a substance called Solex to build the ultimate robot and destroy Bubble Town. His main robot is Kolossal, but he has his own line of evil robots such as Katastrophe, Kannon, Krab, Klawber, and Kilobot. It is unclear what happened to Dr. K at the end of the series finale. Voiced by Maddie Blaustein. Raska: Bubble Town's most famous celebrity, Raska is the spokes model for RobixCorp. Raska does not have any robots of her own besides the Cinematixes that film her. Near the end of the season it is revealed that Raska is the alien from the spaceship that crashed outside RobixCorp, and (using her human disguise) became a member of Prof. Nemo's team (most likely in order to retrieve the Solex). Raska and Dr. K are shown to be in some sort of alliance in order to acquire Solex for their own goals. For most of the season, Raska's true alien form is only seen on Dr. K's screen when communicating with him and is kept in complete silhouette. Her true from is fully shown in the final two episodes. She only appears in the first season since in the final episode of the first season she is killed when Dr.K's giant robot is destroyed by Cubix. Human: Voiced by Megan Hollingshead, Alien: Voiced by Eric Stuart. Miscellaneous. Graham: Connor's dad, who owns and runs Bubble Town's most popular doughnut shop. He dislikes robots, especially the dysfunctional Waitrixes that work at his shop causing him continuous aggravation, yet he developed an exception for Cubix. He believes in good old manual labor and resents how robots have made people lazier over the years. He's a loving father, but has a hard time showing it. Sometimes he cannot quite express how he feels, particularly about his wife's death. This causes a bit of strain on his relationship with Connor. It is also hinted he has a crush on Hela. Voiced by Dan Green. Taryn: Connor's late mother, who supposedly died when he was younger. Connor keeps a picture of her in his room as a memory. Professor Nemo: The ultimate robotist, Professor Nemo was the one who built Cubix and invented the EPU. He disappeared in the aforementioned lab explosion caused by Solex, but was later found kidnapped by Dr. K. A giant sculpture of the Prof. stands in the grand hall of RobixCorp. He designed all of his robots with a yellow spiral. Also voiced by Dan Green. Charles: A spoiled brat and the richest kid in town. Charles is the son of the Mayor and his family has important connections, so he gets all the latest models from RobixCorp. His favorite robot, Quixtreme 5000, is a rare pre-release model given to him as a special birthday gift, that will not be on the market for 10 years! Called Cheetah for short, he can transform into a cherry red Rolls Royce hover car, a cheetah, and an armored battling robot. This makes Charles think he can gain entry into the Botties. It is implied that he has a bit of a crush on Abby and is jealous of Connor. He often follows them around, showing off. Voiced by Ted Lewis. Robots. Botties Robots. Maximix: Maximix is Mong's robot. Maximix has a unicycle propulsion instead of legs and is also capable of transforming into a Go-kart like vehicle to provide Mong with transportation. Although not as strong as Cubix or Kolossal, Maximix has proven himself to be a formidable opponent on several occasions. He can hold his own against Kolossal or any of Dr. K's robots. Thanks to his unicycle propulsion he can reach high speeds and is quite agile. His personality is similar to his master: hot headed, competitive and a little conceited, but always reliable. Maximix's voice is similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Voiced by Frank Frankson. Dondon: Dondon is Abby's pet robot. Dondon is a personal interaction and entertainment robot, outfitted with hovering capabilities allowing him to flutter about for indefinite periods of time. So, although he has wings they are more decorative. Being small and defenseless, Dondon is not a fighter, although there are times when he has shown great courage in order to protect his friends. His features include a video telephone inside his chest cavity, secret recording devices, a camera, and a storage pouch. His yellow face also glows in the dark. His personality is very playful and imaginative- he sometimes pretends to be a secret agent for Abby, disguising himself with her jewelry and hair accessories. Though creative, Dondon is needy of Abby and can be quite bashful with strangers. Voiced by Tara Strong. Cerebrix: Cerebrix is Chip's robot. Like his master, Cerebrix is more of a thought focused character rather than feeling. Bipedal, with no arms, he is equipped with advanced memory, sensory, computing and processing systems stored in his ""large head"". He can also fly by means of a retractable propeller stored in an upper compartment of his head. His main functions include a huge sensory array and he is also equipped with two antennae through which he can tap into almost any communication wavelength and cause disturbances, creating confusion in his foes. Also his advanced probability computing system is capable of determining the outcomes of events before they occur. His personality and speech are much more machine-like but what he has to say is usually very important. Voiced by Jimmy Zoppi. Kan-it: Kan-It is an Attractix model, and the only bot not to be own by a Bottie. Kan-It has a passion for singing, and as such was nicknamed Kan-It because Dr. K, his original master, did not like it. Kan-It speaks in a stereotypical British accent, saying cockney phrases like ""Governor"" and ""Blimey"". Kan-It control's his magnetic power by saying Magnet On(Positive Charge), Magnet Off!(Neutral Charge), Reverse Polarity(Negative Charge). Kan-It currently resides at the Botties Pit, voiced by Terri Irwin's husband Steve Irwin. Villainous Robots. Kilobot: First appearing on the second season, Kilobot is vampiric and far smarter than any of his cohorts, and Dr. K's finest creation. Developed to absorb data from other robots, Kilobot's name comes from the fact that he has the potential to copy the powers of up to 1000 other robots. As such, his power is potentially unlimited. Kilobot originally appeared in a bat-like form, but later upgraded to a bulkier body designed after Cubix's cubes. Kilobot is Cubix's new arch-enemy. At the finale, he took control of Dr. K's robots and planned an ultimate takeover. However, he was permanently deactivated by his own Zombot. Klank: Klank was one of Dr. K's first robots from when he was a child. Klank originally had no EPU, so when the botties found Klank in a disposal room at RobixCorp, they install one to help him adjust to the modern world. Klank's new emotions drive him to seek out Dr. K at an old abandoned house. Unlike Dr. K's other robots, Klank only appears in one episode. Kolossal: A Frankenstein's monster-esque robot, Kolossal is the brute of Dr. K's forces. Not too intelligent and continuously relies on his master for orders but almost equal to Cubix in fighting ability, Kolossal serves as Cubix's nemesis in the early part of the show. Kolossal's equipped with various weapons but most importantly a detachable floating platform on his left shoulder where Dr. K. takes seat. Kolossal is big and strong, although bulky he is capable of limited flight and agile high jumps, his left hand is a sort of claw that can be launched to grab things from afar. Most of the time he uses only brute force to win. Without his master's continuous coordination however he can only complete basic tasks. Kontraption: Dr. K's largest automaton, Kontraption serves as his blimp headquarters after his original base is destroyed. However, Kontraption can also turn into a large robot with great destructive capability. Krab: Squat and crustacean-like, Krab has powerful claws and shoulders that contain a variety of weapons. Katastrophe: A robot capable of splitting into two halves. Katastrophe's top half can fly, while the bottom rolls around on a wheel. Kannon: An artillery robot developed by Dr. K, his body is an assembly of cannons. Klawber: Menace of the skies, Klawber is a super-fast plane that flies through the air. Voiced by Frank Welker. Kulminator: Dr. K's second most powerful robot (behind Kilobot). It was once Dr. K's HQ as a giant advertisement tower in an abandoned area of Bubble Town. After Dr. K had gathered enough Solex, he used it to create a humongous EPU which transformed his HQ into a giant four-legged robot. Dr. K piloted it on a course for Bubble Town with intentions to destroy it. The Botties (piloting Krab, Katastrophe, Klawber, and Kannon) attempted to stop it, but it was too big. The Alien then used the Kulminator's ultimate weapon, the Solex Blaster, to destroy Cubix, but he absorbed the energy and then fired a Solex blast of his own, knocking out the Kulminator's shields. Dr. K wanted to retreat, but the Alien was determined to continue, firing the Solex Blaster at everything while Dr. K abandoned ship. Cubix then flung himself into Kulminator, striking its EPU, destroying it and the Alien. It appeared in 'Cubix the Movie: The Search For Solex' and in season 1 Episode 13 'The Unbeatable Robot'. Zombots: Dr. K's army of duplicating machines. When defeated, their parts can regenerate into new Zombots. In addition, they can evolve into larger, stronger versions of themselves. List of episodes.

wikipedia-3925336," Charity fraud  Charity fraud is the act of using deception to get money from people who believe they are making donations to charities. Often a person or a group of people will make material representations that they are a charity or part of a charity and ask prospective donors for contributions to the non-existent charity. Charity fraud not only includes fictitious charities but also deceitful business acts. Deceitful business acts include businesses accepting donations and not using the money for its intended purposes. Prevention in the United States of America. There are controls and laws governing charities and businesses that accept donations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) has regulations that can be found on their websites. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provides online information about avoiding charity fraud, such as fraudulent schemes that emerge in the wake of natural disasters, claiming to be providing disaster relief. The Internet Crime Complaint Center maintains a list of guidelines to avoid charity fraud when making a donation.  It is advised that people should follow certain guidelines when they donate and that they should consult a list such as the one on the BBB’s website. This list includes the participants in the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's National Charity Seal Program. Participants have met standards for charity accountability and may, for a fee, display the seal logo on their websites as well as any other printed documents. "
wikipedia-3925343," UBI World TV  UBI World TV was an Australian digital satellite pay television service that broadcast predominantly ethnic-minority (and mainly non-English-language) channels. It was launched in late 2004 and closed on Friday 8 June 2012. It offered over 80 channels in its lineup with programming from over 20 countries and in more than 12 languages.  The company also provided entertainment and information services to non-English speakers throughout Australia and New Zealand. It specialised in providing Australian nationals with many different ethnic backgrounds, race, culture, ancestry and/or descent with TV channels from their native or respective homeland, showing news, current affairs, sports, drama series, movies and general entertainment in their own language as a multi-cultural service provider. UBI World TV broadcast TV and radio channels to Australia and New Zealand using the Optus D2 and Intelsat 8 (IS8) satellites. On Wednesday 13 June at approximately 7.00 PM Sydney time, UBI World TV changed its website to inform its customers that it has ceased to trade. The website announcement read as follows: ""On 17 May 2012, BRI Ferrier was appointed Voluntary Administrator of United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd (UBI)."" ""On 1 June 2012, Receivers and Managers from Grant Thornton were appointed to United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd."" ""With effect from 5:00pm on Friday 8 June 2012, United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd ceased to trade."" ""The Receivers and managers are engaged in efforts to dispose of UBI assets that may result in the provision of future channel and broadcast services to subscribers."" ""Subscribers who have paid subscriptions in advance and are no longer receiving transmissions together with unsecured creditors should contact the Voluntary Administrator and lodge a proof of debt."" ""UBI World TV has been proud to have served the multicultural communities of Australia and New Zealand for the past 7 years and would like to thank each and every loyal subscriber for their support."" ""Thank you and goodbye. Salamat at paalam. Gracias y adios. Hoscakalin. Shukran we ma3 elsalama. Ви благодарам и збогум. Hvala i prijatno. Obrigado e adeus. Σας ευχαριστώ και αντίο."" Mass piracy of the service. In late 2008, UBI introduced the new Irdeto Epsilon card part of its encryption process. This new card was considered secure at the time, and most importantly could not be used in sharing servers due to its ""Surf Lock"" countermeasure. By mid-2009, pirates had found a way to bypass this countermeasure and began offering some of the UBI channels on their pirate sharing servers for a cheap yearly fee. Because those sharing servers required the customer to have an internet connection and a satellite dish simultaneously, the pirate service was later reduced to a few channels as there was little interest, owing to UBI's audience being mostly elderly and without access to the internet at home. In December 2010, a team of worldwide hackers introduced the Dragon Card. The card was available in three flavours, Yellow (for ME and AFRICA), Blue (Europe) and the RED (Australia). The Red Dragon Card or RDC was used to pirate Austar, Mysat, TVB, UBI and all the GLOBECAST clients. However as there was a shortage for the Dragon Cards in Australia, hackers in Australia decided to hack the RDC. They converted it to software that runs in the famous Dreambox Satellite Receiver (dm500). The result was the EMUBOX 500 aka the OFFLINE BOX. This very cheap box (circa A$40), now equipped with the RDC codes, was able to decode most Australian services without an internet connection or a SmartCard: just ""plug and watch"". EMUBOX 500 hit the piracy market in late 2011, and was sold in satellite shops for around A$75. By mid-2012 an estimated 50,000 boxes had been sold, mainly in Sydney and Melbourne, leaving satellite shops with no stock. At the current stage, sales have dropped for the operators and for the pirate servers. One pirate server operator asked a hacker to extract the codes used in emubox and sucssesfully sent the codes to Irdeto, resulting in the death of all codes. Strangely, UBI codes remained active until the collapse of the company. One hacker explained that Irdeto, in order to kill a code, need to roll the keys otherwise known as Group Keys. This normally occurs every fortnight, and it is not a free service. Channel history. UBI World TV offered programming that catered to several of the following ethnicities:  "
wikipedia-3925368," Value menu  A value menu (not to be confused with a value meal) is a group of menu items at a fast food restaurant that are designed to be the least expensive items available. In the US, the items are usually priced between $0.99 and $1.49. The portion size, and/or number of items included with the food, are typically related to the price. United States. Arby's. Arby's announced the launch of their value menu on April 9, 2010. Items on the value menu vary based on location, but typically include small or value size roast beef sandwiches, curly fries, milkshakes, chicken sandwiches, ham and cheddar sandwiches, and turnovers. Burger King. Burger King added a value menu in 1998 with items priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu, adding and removing products at 99¢, and later increasing some prices to $1.39. Many of these items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option. McDonald's. After numerous attempts beginning in 1991, experimenting with a variety of menus and pricing strategies, McDonald's launched its first national value menu, the ""Dollar Menu"", in late 2002. Taco Bell. In 1988, Taco Bell lowered the prices of all new items and launched the first three-tiered pricing strategy and free drink refills. In 2010, Taco Bell introduced the $2 Meal Deals menu, featuring a menu item (i.e., a chicken burrito, a beefy 5-layer burrito, a double decker taco, or a Gordita supreme), a bag of Doritos, and a medium drink. Wendy's. Wendy's is generally credited with being the first fast food chain to offer a value menu in October 1989, with every item priced at $0.99. "
wikipedia-3925415," Embarq  Embarq Corporation (stylized as EMBARQ) was the largest independent local exchange carrier in the United States (below the Baby Bells), serving customers in 18 states and providing local, long-distance, high-speed data and wireless services to residential and business customers. It had been formerly the local telephone division (LTD) of Sprint Nextel until 2006, when it was spun off as an independent company. Embarq produced more than $6 billion in revenues annually, and had approximately 18,000 employees. In 2009, it was purchased by CenturyTel, which rebranded as CenturyLink after the merger. History. Brown Telephone Company. The Sprint Corporation was founded in 1899 by Cleyson Leroy Brown under the name of the ""Brown Telephone Company"" in the small town of Abilene, Kansas. The company was a landline telephone company that operated as a competitor to the Bell System. United Telecom. In 1938, after emerging from bankruptcy, Brown changed its name to United Utilities. The company grew steadily through acquisitions and changed its name to United Telecommunications in 1972, at which time it provided local telephone service in many areas of the Midwest and South. United Telecom also operated many other types of businesses. In 1980 United Telecom launched a national X.25 data service, Uninet. To enter the long-distance voice market, United Telecom acquired ISACOMM in 1981 and US Telephone in 1984. Sprint. Southern Pacific Communications Company (SPCC), a unit of the Southern Pacific Railroad, began providing long-distance telephone service shortly after the Execunet II decision late in 1978. The Railroad had an extensive microwave communications system along its rights of way used for internal communications. In 1972 they began selling surplus time on that system to corporations for use as their own Private Line Network, thereby circumventing AT&T's then-monopoly on public telephony, later expanding to fiber optic cables laid along those same rights of way subsequent to the Execunet II decision late in 1978. Prior attempts at offering long distance service were not approved by the Federal Communications Commission, though the company's fax service (SpeedFAX) had been permitted. SPC was headquartered in Burlingame, California, where Sprint still maintains a technology lab on Adrian Court. As mentioned above, SPCC was only permitted to provide Private Line service and not switched services. When MCI Communications released EXECUNET, SPCC went to court with the FCC to get the right to offer switched services. The reason for the contest was to name the new switched service.  The SPRINT service was first marketed to six metropolitan areas, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Diego and Anaheim. The switches were located in Los Angeles and New York. A customer, required to have a Private Line connection to one of these switches in order to use the service, paid an access fee per Private Line. The customer was then billed at 2.6 cents per tenth of a minute increment. Southern Pacific Communications became part of GTE in 1982 under the name GTE Sprint. GTE had previously acquired a national X.25 provider, Telenet, in 1979. In 1986, GTE Sprint was merged with GTE Telenet, US Telecom, Uninet, and ISACOMM to form US Sprint. This was a partnership owned by GTE and United Telecom. In 1989 United Telecom purchased controlling interest in US Sprint. In 1991 United Telecom completed its acquisition of US Sprint. That same year United Telecom changed its name to Sprint due in large part to the increased brand recognition of Sprint, as a result of the successful Candice Bergen ""Dime Lady"" advertisement campaign. In 1983 United Telecom's Telespectrum began offering cellular telephone services in United's territories. In 1988 Telespectrum was sold to Centel for $763 million to fund United's purchase of an additional 30% of U.S. Sprint. This purchase gave United operational control of US Sprint. In 1993 Sprint merged with Centel, which allowed Sprint to provide local service in a total of 18 states and put them back in the wireless business. In late 1994 and early 1995, Sprint via Sprint Spectrum (a joint venture between Sprint and several cable companies) acquired near nationwide PCS spectrum. Later in 1995 the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint PCS brand. On October 5, 1999, Sprint and MCI WorldCom announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies. The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time. However, the deal did not go through because of pressure from the United States Department of Justice and the European Union on concerns of it creating a monopoly. In 2003 Sprint began recombining their local telecom, long-distance, wireline, and wireless business units into a new company, marketing the combined company as ""One Sprint"". In April 2004, the separately traded wireless tracking stock, ""PCS"", was absorbed into the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ""FON"" ticker symbol, Sprint's former ticker symbol. (FON stood for ""Fiber Optic Network"", which was Sprint's bragging right, but was also a homophone of the word ""phone""). This was challenged in many lawsuits by Sprint PCS shareholders claiming the stock was devalued through the ratio of 1 share of PCS stock for 1/2 share of FON stock. Sprint agreed to settle with the shareholders for $57.5 million. Merger with Nextel and Embarq spinoff. In 2005, Sprint acquired NEXTEL Communications, renaming itself Sprint Nextel. The local operations were spun off in 2006 to become Embarq. Acquisition by CenturyTel. On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $11.6 billion, including the assumption of $5.8 billion in Embarq's debt. CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post became CEO of the combined company. On June 2, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq announced that the combined entity would be called CenturyLink. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009. Former coverage area. Embarq's coverage territory included that of the former incumbent local exchange carrier companies of Carolina Telephone & Telegraph, United Telephone Company, and Centel. Embarq provided its local service in 19 states. Products. Embarq focused on sales of landline telephone service, high-speed internet, and DISH Network satellite TV. Embarq offered bundled services to their customers, with the convenience of one monthly bill and offered discounts for adding additional services.  Embarq telephone service was a traditional landline Plain-old telephone system (POTS). Common offerings included features such as Caller ID, Call waiting, 3-way calling, Call forwarding, Voice mail, and Anonymous call rejection. Embarq offered many long distance plans, including unlimited domestic direct-dialed calling. Depending on market and geographical region, Embarq offered several high-speed internet technologies. Embarq covered the majority of their territory with ADSL at speeds of 768 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s, 3.0 Mbit/s, or 5.0 Mbit/s as line conditions allowed. In September 2007 Embarq began offering 10.0 Mbit/s to customers in Las Vegas. Beginning in January 2008, Embarq released the 10 Mbit/s tier across their entire footprint. Embarq offered fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) in additional markets, such as parts of Las Vegas, Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. Embarq had and established partnership with EchoStar-owned DISH Network and offered a comprehensive lineup of DISH Network services to its customers. Discounts were available when eligible DISH Network programming was bundled with other qualifying Embarq products. In addition to the DISH Network partnership, Embarq also planned to test a TV service (tentatively called Embarq TV) in the near future. Details were scarce, but the service was rumored to have been an IPTV fiber-to-the-node service similar to AT&T's U-verse. Testing was completed and Embarq/CenturyLink rolled out IPTV to its customer base in Jefferson City, MO in October 2009. CenturyTel is providing its IPTV feed to the Jefferson City switching office from its service in Columbia, MO. CenturyLink now offers its Prism TV service in select markets, which may be based off of Embarq TV.  Embarq provided wireless phone service only for business accounts; they closed residential wireless business. Embarq provided business wireless phone service throughout much of its territory. Embarq operated as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) for Sprint PCS. Embarq utilized the CDMA band, and their handsets connect primarily to Sprint PCS towers. However, Embarq handsets were also capable of roaming onto CDMA networks from other carriers. Embarq DSL customers were offered free Earthlink services until the formation of Myembarq.com. In 2007, Embarq customers were required to switch to Myembarq and Embarqmail. Criticisms. Embarq previously worked with NebuAd, a behavioral targeting advertising company to track customers' internet browsing habits. The goal was to deliver relevant ads based on browsing history. This has raised several legal and privacy concerns, along with the other internet providers using NebuAd and related services such as Charter Communications and WOW!. Embarq's use of NebuAd prompted a letter from Congressman Edward Markey. Embarq responded to Congressman Markey's letter. Embarq later claimed that its participation with NebuAD was a trial, and that they were not currently using NebuAd for behavioral targeted advertising. "
wikipedia-3925423," First Data  First Data Corporation is a global payment processing company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. First Data is a provider of electronic commerce and payment solutions. The company's portfolio includes merchant transaction processing services; credit, debit, private-label, gift, payroll and other prepaid card offerings; fraud protection and authentication solutions, credit reporting agency services (through First Data Merchant Services Corporation); electronic check acceptance services through TeleCheck; as well as Internet commerce and mobile payment solutions. The company's STAR Network offers PIN-secured debit acceptance at ATM and retail locations. History. In 1969, the Mid-America Bankcard Association (MABA) was formed in Omaha, Nebraska, as a non-profit bankcard processing cooperative. Two years later, First Data Resources (FDR) incorporated in June to become a for-profit organization providing processing services to MABA. FDR had 110 employees and $222 million in annual revenues. First Data is an agglomeration of various cooperative associations which were initially established to provide credit card data processing services for member banks. These include Eastern States Bankcard Association; Atlantic States Bankcard Association; Southwestern States Bankcard Association; Mountain States Bankcard Association, and Western States Bankcard Association. In 1980, American Express Information Services Corporation (ISC) bought 80% of FDR. The remaining 20% was purchased in 5% increments each subsequent year until June 1983. First Data Corporation spun off from American Express and went public in 1992. In 1995, the company merged with First Financial Management Corp. (FFMC) and was then organized into three major business units serving card issuers, merchants and consumers. Western Union became part of First Data as a result of the merger with FFMC.  By 1998, First Data was providing transaction processing services not only in the U.S., but also in markets around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Canada. The company also began to see significant growth in its network of Western Union agent locations. This set the stage for First Data to become a leading global provider of electronic commerce and payment solutions to businesses and consumers worldwide.  From 2001 through 2005, a period of expansion occurred as First Data acquired companies around the globe and in the U.S., including, in 2001, the acquisition of PaySys International and their globally successful VisionPLUS Payment Software System VisionPLUS followed by $6.6 billion merger with Concord EFS in 2004, which added the STAR Network and PIN-based debit acceptance at more than 1.9 million ATM and retail locations. Additional acquisitions and strategic relationships included GovOne, the creation of eONEGlobal as a venture capital fund, the acquisition of Paymap, Inc., a company servicing electronic payment products, and the acquisition of Taxware, which would be merged into a new entity, named Velosant to spearhead broad Supply Chain Management initiatives. First Data also established a consumer payments brand which would take Direct Debit offerings to the retail marketplace. First Data further expanded geographically in Europe, Asia and Latin America.  In 2005, First Data was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. On January 26, 2006, First Data announced its intention to spin off Western Union into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Western Union to First Data shareholders. The spin off occurred as planned on September 29, 2006.  On April 2, 2007 it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) had entered an agreement to acquire First Data in one of the largest leveraged buy-outs in history, and on October 1, 2007 KKR officially took over the First Data Corporation. Ric Duques retired, and Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI, Inc., the president of Hewlett-Packard Company, and also the chairman/CEO of the Compaq Computer Corporation was appointed CEO. As a privately owned company, First Data's stock was taken off the New York Stock Exchange on September 24, 2007. However, the company's LBO was financed with $24 billion in debt, and it remains heavily leveraged. The company continues to maintain investor relations pages on its web site and to publish quarterly financial results. Within two months after the KKR acquisition, the company laid off 1,700 employees across North America, Europe and Australia, about 6% of its workforce. First Data entered the Ireland market in a joint venture with Allied Irish Banks plc named AIB Merchant Services on January 18, 2008. First Data also acquired ICICI Bank's merchant services business in 2009 for 4 billion Indian rupees ($80 million USD). The processing platforms maintained by First Data are North(Cardnet), South(Nabanco), Nashville(Envoy), Omaha and BuyPass(Concord/Atlanta). Management. Key executives include: Headquarters. First Data's headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. First Data's headquarters were located in Greenwood Village, Colorado. In 2009 First Data announced that it was moving its headquarters from Greater Denver to 5565 Glenridge Connector, NE Atlanta, GA 30342 . Its original headquarters, where the company remained based until 1992, were in Omaha, Nebraska. "
wikipedia-3925445," International zone  An international zone is a type of extraterritoriality governed by international law, or similar treaty between two or more nations. They can be found within international airports and can contain duty free shopping. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other. Green Zone (Iraq). Iraq has its international zone around the Republican Palace in central Baghdad in a crook of the Tigris River. This area was and still is the heavily fortified headquarters for the coalition and Iraqi Reconstruction Ministries. The official name started as the ""Green Zone"" but was later changed to the ""International Zone"" in June 2004 with the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people. Vienna after World War II. French, British, American and Soviet troops divided Vienna into four zones, and a small international zone was governed in rotation by troops of those countries. International airports. International airports have international zones for individuals who have not cleared customs and immigration of the hosting country. United Nations Headquarters. The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City that exists on international territory. The territory is administered by the United Nations, but is still subjected to most local, state, and federal laws. The United Nations has three additional, subsidiary, regional headquarters or headquarter districts. These are located in Geneva (Switzerland), Vienna (Austria), and Nairobi (Kenya). These adjunct offices also enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges. Channel Tunnel. The United Kingdom and France established ""international zones"" or ""control zones"" at both ends of the Channel Tunnel, which crosses underneath the English Channel. British authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the French side, and French authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the UK side. Violations in the control zone are treated as if they occurred within the territory of the adjoining state within that zone, and extradition is not required to remove a violator to the operating state for prosecution. Officers of the adjoining state may carry firearms within the control zone. Tangier. The city of Tangier, Morocco, was an international zone from 1912 to 1956. Ottawa Civic Hospital, Canada. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands was born in Ottawa, Canada, as the family had been living in there since June 1940 after the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany. The maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital in which Princess Margriet was born was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government. Making the maternity ward outside of the Canadian domain caused it to be unaffiliated with any jurisdiction and technically international territory. This was done to ensure that the newborn Princess would derive her citizenship from her mother only, thus making her solely Dutch and still viable for the Dutch line of succession to the throne. Proposals for Jerusalem. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the city of Jerusalem was supposed to become an International Zone. This was never implemented, the city becoming the scene of fierce fighting in 1948 which culminated with its partition between Israel and Jordan. Nineteen years later in 1967 the Jordanian part was occupied and unilaterally annexed by Israel. However, the idea of an international zone in Jerusalem, embracing at least the highly sensitive Old City of Jerusalem, continue to be floated by various would-be mediators. "
wikipedia-3925533," Enumerative combinatorics  Enumerative combinatorics is an area of combinatorics that deals with the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed. Two examples of this type of problem are counting combinations and counting permutations. More generally, given an infinite collection of finite sets {""S""""i""} indexed by the natural numbers, enumerative combinatorics seeks to describe a ""counting function"" which counts the number of objects in ""S""""n"" for each ""n"". Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions. The simplest such functions are ""closed formulas"", which can be expressed as a composition of elementary functions such as factorials, powers, and so on. For instance, as shown below, the number of different possible orderings of a deck of ""n"" cards is ""f""(""n"") = ""n""!. Often, no closed form is initially available. In these cases, we frequently first derive a recurrence relation, then solve the recurrence to arrive at the desired closed form.  Finally, ""f""(""n"") may be expressed by a formal power series, called its ""generating function"", which is most commonly either the ordinary generating function or the exponential generating function Often, a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows.  In these cases, a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable. A function formula_3 is an asymptotic approximation to formula_4 if formula_5 as formula_6. In this case, we write formula_7  Once determined, the generating function yields the information given by the previous approaches. In addition, the various natural operations on generating functions such as addition, multiplication, differentiation, etc., have a combinatorial significance; this allows one to extend results from one combinatorial problem in order to solve others. Generating functions. Generating functions are used to describe families of combinatorial objects. Let formula_8 denote the family of objects and let ""F""(""x"") be its generating function. Then: Where formula_10 denotes the number of combinatorial objects of size ""n"". The number of combinatorial objects of size ""n"" is therefore given by the coefficient of formula_11. Some common operation on families of combinatorial objects and its effect on the generating function will now be developed. The exponential generating function is also sometimes used. In this case it would have the form: Union. Given two combinatorial families, formula_8 and formula_14 with generating functions ""F""(""x"") and ""G""(""x"") respectively, the union of the two families (formula_15) has generating function ""F""(""x"") + ""G""(""x""). Pairs. For two combinatorial families as above the Cartesian product (pair) of the two families (formula_16) has generating function ""F""(""x"")""G""(""x""). Sequences. A sequence generalizes the idea of the pair as defined above. Sequences are arbitrary Cartesian products of a combinatorial object with itself. Formally: To put the above in words: An empty sequence or a sequence of one element or a sequence of two elements or a sequence of three elements, etc. The generating function would be: Combinatorial structures. The above operations can now be used to enumerate common combinatorial objects including trees (binary and plane), Dyck paths and cycles. A combinatorial structure is composed of atoms. For example, with trees the atoms would be the nodes. The atoms which compose the object can either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled atoms are indistinguishable from each other, while labelled atoms are distinct. Therefore, for a combinatorial object consisting of labeled atoms a new object can be formed by simply swapping two or more atoms. Binary and plane trees. Binary and plane trees are examples of an unlabeled combinatorial structure. Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let formula_19 denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows: In this case formula_21 represents the family of objects consisting of one node. This has generating function ""x"". Let ""P""(""x"") denote the generating function formula_19 Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function: After solving for ""P""(""x""): An explicit formula for the number of plane trees of size ""n"" can now be determined by extracting the coefficient of ""x""""n"". Note: The notation [""x""""n""] ""f""(""x"") refers to the coefficient of ""x""""n"" in ""f""(""x""). The series expansion of the square root is based on Newton's generalization of the Binomial theorem. To get from the fourth to fifth line manipulations using the generalized binomial coefficient is needed.  The expression on the last line is equal to the (""n"" -1)th Catalan number. Therefore ""p""""n"" = ""c""""n""-1. "
wikipedia-3925565," Extraocular implant  An extraocular implant (also known as ""eyeball jewelry"") is a cosmetic implant involving a tiny piece of decorative jewelry which is implanted within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye. History and culture. Eyeball jewelry was developed first in the Netherlands as a radical new form of body modification in 2002. It was first designed at the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery and is marketed there under the name JewelEye. The procedure is completely legal in the Netherlands, as long as it is performed by a licensed ophthalmologist under sterile conditions. The current cost is approximately €750 .  Its legality outside of the Netherlands is currently untested. However, several jurisdictions in the US have already supported bills to ban the procedure even though it hasn’t become available in the US yet. On March 6, 2005, an Illinois state committee approved a bill banning the procedure. Infraction could result in a penalty of up to three years in prison. Procedure. Unlike subdermal implants and other new body modification procedures, the extraocular implant is currently only being performed in a medical clinic environment. The procedure is relatively quick, but it does require that both eyes be immobilized with anesthetic drops, and that the layers of the eyeball where the implant is situated must be separated by the injection of liquid. As very few people have undergone this procedure, and it is relatively new, the long term health effects are currently unknown. However, the Website of the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery states that the implant does not interfere with the ocular functions, i.e. the visual performance and mobility. Additionally, patient satisfaction remains high and no side effects of the treatment have been noticed with a follow-up of more than one year. Jewelry. Currently, the only supplier of jewelry for this implant is Hippocratech b.v., a company in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The implant is manufactured from a platinum alloy and is available in several basic shapes, including the Euro sign, heart, music note, clover or star shapes, with other shapes custom made by the company upon request. The size of the jewellery is about 1/8"" (3 mm) across. "
wikipedia-3925621," Volksempfänger  The Volksempfänger (German for ""people's receiver"") was a range of radio receivers developed by engineer Otto Griessing at the request of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The purpose of the ""Volksempfänger""-program was to make radio reception technology affordable to the general public. Joseph Goebbels realized the great propaganda potential of this relatively new medium and thus considered widespread availability of receivers highly important. History. The original Volksempfänger VE301 model was presented on August 18, 1933 at the 10. Große Deutsche Funkausstellung in Berlin. The VE301 was available at a readily affordable price of 76 German Reichsmark (equivalent to two weeks' average salary), and a cheaper 35 Reichsmark model, the DKE38 (sometimes called ""Goebbels-Schnauze"" – ""Goebbels' snout"" – by the general public) fitted with a multisection tube, was also later produced, along with a series of other models under the Volksempfänger, Gemeinschaftsempfänger, KdF (Kraft durch Freude), DKE (Deutscher Kleinempfänger) and other brands. Listening to foreign stations became a criminal offence in Nazi Germany when the war began, while in some occupied territories, such as Poland, all radio listening by non-German citizens was outlawed (later in the war this prohibition was extended to other occupied countries coupled with mass seizures of radio sets). Penalties ranged from confiscation of radios and imprisonment to, particularly later in the war, the death penalty. Nevertheless, such clandestine listening was widespread in many Nazi-occupied countries and (particularly later in the war) in Germany itself. The Germans also attempted radio jamming of some enemy stations with limited success. Effects. Much has been said about the efficiency of the ""Volksempfänger"" as a propaganda tool. Most famously, Hitler's architect and Minister for Armaments and War Production, Albert Speer, said in his final speech at the Nuremberg trials: However, despite Speer's claim, both Mussolini's Italy and Stalin's Russia had used radio as a tool to influence the masses long before Hitler's rise to power. Utility receiver. The British equivalent of the Volksempfänger was the Utility Radio which was produced to a standard government approved design by a consortium of manufacturers using standard components to make repair easier. It was designed without a longwave band, making reception of foreign stations even more difficult than with the Volksempfänger. "
wikipedia-3925654," NatWest Series  The NatWest Series is the name used for One Day International cricket tournaments held in England since 2000. The tournaments are sponsored by the National Westminster Bank. 2000 to 2005: triangular series. The original format of the NatWest Series was a three-team triangular tournament, involving England and two visiting international sides. Each of the three teams would play the other two three times each, after which the two top teams would face each other in a final at Lord's in London. The ten matches would be played at the seven international grounds (Lord's, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford, The Oval, Trent Bridge and the Riverside Ground), a well as other county cricket grounds such as the St Lawrence Ground (Canterbury), Sophia Gardens (Cardiff), the Rose Bowl (Southampton) and at Bristol. The first NatWest Series was held in 2000 a year after England hosted the World Cup. The West Indies and Zimbabwe were the two visiting teams, with England and Zimbabwe contesting the first final. England won by 6 wickets, with Darren Gough taking 3–20 and Alec Stewart scoring 97. It used to be a common occurrence at the end of cricket Test matches for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK this tradition ended in 2001 Natwest Series after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a one-day match between England and Pakistan. Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine, and post-match presentations are held on the field. During the presentation ceremony at the 2001 NatWest Series final on the balcony at Lord's, Michael Bevan was hit in the face with a beer can thrown from the crowd. Other notable matches in the series included the 2002 final, where England faced India: England posted a total of 325–5 with Nasser Hussain scoring 115, his only one day century, and Marcus Trescothick also scoring 109, but were beaten by India who made 326–8 thanks to Mohammad Kaif scoring 87 and Yuvraj Singh 69. In 2005, Bangladesh secured an unexpected victory over Australia in Cardiff, with Mohammad Ashraful scoring a century. Also, that year's final between Australia and England was a tie, with both sides scoring 196 and sharing the trophy. By the time of the last triangular tournament in 2005, every test-playing nation had participated in at least one NatWest Series. NatWest Challenge. For three seasons, from 2003 to 2005, three extra One Day Internationals were arranged for the England team in addition to the NatWest Series. In 2003, Pakistan came to England for the three match series. In 2004, India played the NatWest Challenge as a prelude to the ICC Champions Trophy held in England that year. The following year, Australia played these matches between the NatWest Series and The Ashes. The ICC began their trial of the ""Supersub"", 12th man who could bat or bowl and ""Powerplay"", flexible fielding restrictions in the 2005 matches. The Supersub idea was jettisoned after a year whilst the Powerplay experiment was retained. 2006 to date. The triangular format was abandoned in 2006, when England reverted to playing separate series against each visiting team (as they had in the Texaco Trophy from 1984 until 1998), but the name NatWest Series was retained. This was attributed to the poor crowds at matches not involving the home team. The NatWest Series includes one or two matches in the Twenty20 cricket format against the touring team. The home team now plays 10 One Day Internationals a season. In 2006, England played five matches against each of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing 5–0 to Sri Lanka and drawing 2–2 with Pakistan. In 2007, the visiting teams were the West Indies and India: England lost the three-match series against the West Indies 2–1, and defeated India 4–3 in the seven-match series. 2008 Series. In June 2008, England lost the five-match series against New Zealand 3–1 with one match rained off. During a close match 4 at The Oval that NZ won, Grant Elliott was controversially ran out after a mid-pitch collision with Ryan Sidebottom. In August/September 2008, England beat South Africa 4–0 in the five match series with the final match rained off. Led by new captain Kevin Pietersen, a revitalised England beat an ""end of tour"" South Africa. In match 2 in Nottingham, SA were bowled out for 83 and England won the day/night match before the floodlights were required. In the Twenty20 matches, England beat New Zealand in the only match in Manchester in June however the match against South Africa at Chester-le-Street was abandoned without a ball being bowled. 2009 Series. In May 2009, England led by Andrew Strauss beat the West Indies 2–0 with one match rained off. England won both matches, by 58 runs at Birmingham and by 6 wickets, Bristol, respectively. There were no Twenty20 internationals scheduled due to the ICC World Twenty20 event in June. In August/September England were scheduled to play two Twenty20 matches at Manchester versus Australia. The first match was abandoned during the England innings and the second match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. A seven match series was contested in September 2009 versus Australia after the home team's Ashes series win. The Australians won the first six, at The Oval, two at Lords, Southampton and two at Nottingham, and England won the final match at the Chester-le-Street. The top run scorer in the series was Andrew Strauss, 267 runs for England, who also scored most in the Ashes Test match series. Top wicket taker was Brett Lee, 12 wickets for Australia, who did not appear in the summer's Test series. 2010 Series. During the 2010 summer there were three NatWest Series. In June 2010, England played a five match tour series versus Australia, who were in the country to play a Test series Pakistan. England beat the Australians 3–2 winning the first three matches with Eoin Morgan scoring the most runs, 238 runs and Stuart Broad taking 12 wickets on either side. In July, England beat Bangladesh 2–1 in a three match series. The series was notable as Bangladesh beat England for the very first time in one-day cricket. In September, England played Pakistan in two Twenty20 matches (not part of the NatWest Series) and a five match one-day match series. This series was played with the backdrop of spot fixing allegations made against Pakistani players during the Test match series against England. England won the two Twenty20 matches at Cardiff. England then went on to win the one-day series 3–2. England lost the 3rd match at The Oval by 23 runs. The ICC launched an investigation into the match after receiving information that there were scoring irregularities during the England innings. Ijaz Butt the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman suggested that as ""a conspiracy"" to defraud Pakistan cricket. Butt went on to accuse England players of bad practice, allegations he later withdrew. Andrew Strauss scored the most runs, 317 runs and Umar Gul took most wickets, 12, during the series. 2011 Series. In June and July 2011, England won the five match series 3–2 versus Sri Lanka. England won the close deciding 5th match at Old Trafford by 16 runs. The 2nd match at The Oval was notable as Sri Lankan batsman Sanath Jayasuriya played his 445th and final one-day international. England's captain Alastair Cook scored the most runs in the series (298). Sri Lankan Spinner Suraj Randiv and England fast bowler James Anderson were joint highest wicket takers, (9). Sri Lanka won the Nat West Twenty20 International by 9 wickets at Bristol. In September, England won a five match series versus India 3–0 with one tied match and one no result. The 4th match at Lords ended in a tie under the Duckworth-Lewis method. The 5th match at Cardiff, was Rahul Dravid's 344th and final one-day international. He also played his first and last Twenty20 International at Old Trafford. England won the that match, at the end of August, by 6 wickets. In the one day series, Indian captain MS Dhoni scored the most runs, (236) and English spinner Graeme Swann took the most wickets (8). India went through the whole tour of England without a win in an international match, after also losing the Test series 4–0. England played two more Twenty20 Internationals at The Oval versus the West Indies to close the season. The series ended 1–1. NatWest Series results since 2006. '* One match no result "
wikipedia-3925840," Richardson High School  Richardson High School (RHS) is a high school in Richardson, Texas, United States with a 2011 enrollment of approximately 2500 and a student/teacher ratio of 14.5. Background. Richardson High School is the flagship high school of the Richardson Independent School District (RISD). The school has magnet programs in fine arts, culinary arts, theatre, communications, robotics, law, health science and science, and award-winning mock trial and debate teams. In the 2012 ""U.S. News & World Report"" rankings of the Best Schools in America, Richardson High School ranked number 711 out of 21,766 public high schools, putting it in the top 3.5% of all public high schools in the United States. RHS was also rated the 65th best in the state of Texas. In August 2006, Richardson High School was named one of three ""best practices"" high schools in the state of Texas. The award granted by the National Council of Educational Accountability and the Just 4 Kids Foundation is based upon staff development, staff retention, standardized test scores and support programs for students.  In May 2007, the RISD was awarded the ""Excellence in Education Award for Large School District in Texas"" by the HEB Foundation. Richardson High School and Richardson West Junior High played instrumental roles in the selection process and hosted the site visit committee in March 2007. In addition to the award, the RISD received a check for $100,000. The school, which opened shortly after the first public school in the city was burned down by Ross Inman in 1890, began in a two-room building on Old Pike Road, a street that is now part of Greenville Avenue. A rural school with fewer than 100 students up to 1950, the school opened its present facility in 1961. During the period of the late 1950s, RHS shared facilities with Westwood Junior High School on Abrams Road. Bill Passmore was principal during this transition into the new facility on Belt Line Road. Richardson's sports mascot is the Eagles and the team shares Eagle-Mustang Stadium (capacity 11,000) with J. J. Pearce High School.  The school's student news magazine is the ""Talon"". As of the 2010–2011 school year, the administration at RHS is led by Charles Pickitt, principal; Ramiro Lucio, senior principal; Michael Westfall, assistant principal; Josh Eason, assistant principal; Elise Curry, assistant principal; Sharonda Tims, assistant principal; and Talandra Griffen, assistant principal. Jeremy Delle suicide. On January 8, 1991, Jeremy Delle, a 15-year-old sophomore who had recently transferred to the school, killed himself with a .357 Magnum revolver in front of his second-period English class. He was described by schoolmates as ""acting sad"". After coming into class late that morning, he was told to get an attendance slip from the school office. He left and returned with a revolver. He walked to the front of the class and announced, ""Miss, I got what I really went for."" Delle then put the gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger. The incident inspired the Pearl Jam song ""Jeremy"". The band's lead singer, Eddie Vedder, read a newspaper account of the incident and was moved to write the song almost immediately. KRET-TV. In 1960 the Richardson Independent School District established KRET, the first TV station in the nation to be owned by a school district. The studio was located at Richardson High from 1963–1970. The studio was previously located at Richardson Junior High School (1960–1963). The station was converted on August 31, 1970, into a closed-circuit network named ""TAGER"". Brent Archie incident.

wikipedia-3925944," Education in New York City  Education in New York City is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions. The city's public school system, the New York City Department of Education, is the largest in the world, and New York is home to some of the most important libraries, universities, and research centers in the world. The city is particularly known as a global center for research in medicine and the life sciences. In 2006, New York had the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the United States, 40,000 licensed physicians, and 127 Nobel laureates with roots in local institutions. The city receives the second-highest amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health among all U.S. cities. It also struggles with disparity in its public school system, with some of the best ""and"" worst performing public schools in the United States. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg the city has embarked on a major school reform effort. The New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the country, serves Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, and Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn. The New York Public Library has several research libraries, including the Main Branch and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Higher education. There are about 594,000 university students in New York City attending around 110 universities and colleges. New York State is the nation’s largest importer of college students, according to statistics which show that among freshmen who leave their home states to attend college, more come to New York than any other state, including California. Enrollment in New York State is led by New York City, which is home to more university students than any other city in the United States. The higher education sector is also a vital contributor to NYC's economy, employing 110,000 people in 2007 and accounting for nearly 2.5 percent of overall employment in NYC. Public higher education is provided by the many campuses of the City University of New York (CUNY), which has over 450,000 students, second in number only to the separate State University of New York (SUNY) and California State University. CUNY is built around the City College of New York, whose own history dates back to the formation of the Free Academy in 1847. Much of CUNY's student body, which represent 145 countries, consists of new immigrants to New York City. CUNY has campuses in all of the five boroughs, with 11 four-year colleges, 6 two-year colleges, a law school, a graduate school, a medical school, an honors college, and a journalism school. A third of college graduates in New York City are CUNY graduates, with the institution enrolling about half of all college students in New York City. The City University's alumni include Jonas Salk, Colin Powell, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. New York also has many nationally-important independent universities and colleges, such as (in alphabetical order) Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, Long Island University, Manhattan College, New York University, Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, Pace University, Pratt Institute, St. John's University, The New School, and Yeshiva University. The city has dozens of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions, such as St. Francis College, The Juilliard School and The School of Visual Arts. Columbia University, an Ivy League university in northwestern Manhattan founded in 1754, is the fifth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Barnard College is an independent women's college, one of the original Seven Sisters, affiliated with Columbia. Through a reciprocal agreement, Barnard and Columbia students share classes, housing, and extracurricular activities, and Barnard graduates receive the degree of the University. New York University (NYU) is a private, nonsectarian research university based in New York City. NYU's main campus is situated in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan. Founded in 1831, NYU is one of the largest private, nonprofit institutions of higher education in the United States. The New School, located mostly in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, is a private multidisciplinary university housing eight specialized colleges, including the internationally recognized art school, Parsons The New School for Design. Founded in 1919 as The New School for Social Research, the university established itself as a modern free school where adult students could ""seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working."" Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, was founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper to provide tuition-free education in engineering, architecture and the fine arts. For 150 years, the College has admitted students based on merit alone and provided each with a full-tuition scholarship. Two of the United States' leading Roman Catholic universities are in New York City. The Jesuit-associated Fordham University, with campuses in Manhattan and the Bronx, was the first Catholic university in the Northeast, founded in 1841. St. John's University was founded by the Vincentian Fathers in 1870 and now has campuses in Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island; it is the country's largest Catholic university (over 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students).  Yeshiva University, in Washington Heights, is a Jewish university rooted in America's oldest Yeshiva, founded in 1886. One of the nation's most prestigious conservatories, The Juilliard School, is located on the Upper West Side. New York Law School is a private law school in lower Manhattan and is one of the oldest independent law schools in the United States. The New York Academy of Sciences is a society of some 20,000 scientists of all disciplines from 150 countries. Primary and secondary education. Public schools. The New York City public school system is the largest in the world. More than 1.1 million students are taught in more than 1,700 public schools with a budget of $21 billion. The public school system is managed by the New York City Department of Education. It includes Empowerment Schools. Among New York City public high schools are selective specialized schools such as CUNY-run Hunter College High School (the public school which sends the highest percentage of its graduates to Ivy League schools in the United States; ranked as the top public high school in the United States), Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School The school that requires the highest cutoff of the SHSAT, and the teaching home of Pulitzer Prize winner Frank McCourt; often considered one of the best public high schools in the United States), Bronx High School of Science (which has the largest number of graduates who are Nobel Laureates of any high school in the world) and Brooklyn Technical High School (one of the few public schools that uses a college-style major system after their students' sophomore year, and one of the largest populated and largely constructed schools in the nation). Townsend Harris High School in Queens is another selective school situated on a bucolic campus that offers small class sizes compared to schools of equal rigor, where the average student takes two different foreign languages including Latin and/or Greek. The Brooklyn High School of the Arts is the only high school in the United States to offer a major in Historic Preservation. The High School of American Studies at Lehman College, and Staten Island Technical High School has rapidly become one of New York's hardest schools to get into, and was ranked by U.S. News & World Report the highest specialized high school in NYC, beating Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. Bard High School Early College is one of the few, tuition-free, early college entrance programs in the nation that provides graduates with a high school diploma and an Associate of Arts degree. Murry Bergtraum High School is the oldest business high school in Lower Manhattan that integrates an array of specialized courses such as shorthand, and MOS certification courses (including courses that are not offered elsewhere in the United States. The Harvey Milk High School is the only public high school in the United States for gay, lesbian, and transgendered students. Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, long considered the prototype for all performing art high schools across the world, has a very selective audition process. LaGuardia offers conservatory caliber training in the fields of dance, art, vocal music, instrumental music and drama. The movie ""Fame"" is based on this school and it has a long list of notable alumni. The High School of Art and Design is one of the oldest vocational schools in the United States, training students in the visual arts since 1936. School funding lawsuit. A constitutional challenge to the New York State school funding system was filed in 1993 by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. The lawsuit, ""CFE v. State of New York"", claims that the state's school finance system under-funds New York City public schools and denies its students their constitutional right to a sound basic education. The Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, ruled in 1996 that the New York State constitution requires that the state offer all children the opportunity for a ""sound basic education"". In 2001, State Supreme Court Justice Leland DeGrasse found that the current state school funding system was unconstitutional. Governor George Pataki appealed the decision, which was overturned in 2002 by the Appellate Division. CFE appealed to the Court of Appeals, which again found in favor of CFE in 2003. The Court of Appeals gave the State of New York until July 30, 2004 to comply with its order. The state failed to meet this deadline, however, and the court appointed three referees who were given until November 30, 2004 to submit a compliance plan to Justice Leland DeGrasse of the State Supreme Court. Justice DeGrasse agreed with the referees' recommendations and in 2005 ruled that New York City schools need nearly $15 billion to provide students with their constitutional right to the opportunity to receive a sound basic education. Governor Pataki appealed again to the Appellate Division. In 2006, however, the Appellate Division ordered the State Legislature to consider a plan to direct between $4.7 billion and $5.63 billion to New York City schools and upheld an earlier ruling to provide about $9.2 billion in capital funds to the school system over five years. New York City's public secondary schools include: Bard High School Early College, Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School, Hunter College High School, LaGuardia High School, Staten Island Technical High School, Stuyvesant High School, and Townsend Harris High School. The city is home to the largest Roman Catholic high school in the U.S., St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens, and the only official Italian-American school in the country, La Scuola d'Italia on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

The collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists, as well as numerous works of sculpture and porcelain. It also has furniture, enamel, and carpets. The Jewish Museum of New York was first established in 1904, when the Jewish Theological Seminary received a gift a 26 Jewish ceremonial art objects by Judge Mayer Sulzberger. The museum now boasts a collection 28,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, archaeological artifacts, and many other pieces important to the preservation of Jewish history and culture. Founded in 1969 by a group of Puerto Rican artists, educators, community activists and civic leaders, El Museo del Barrio is located at the top of Museum Mile in East Harlem, a neighborhood also called 'El Barrio'. Originally, the museum was a creation of the Nuyorican Movement and Civil Rights Movement, and primarily functioned as a neighborhood institution serving Puerto Ricans. With the increasing size of New York's Latino population, the scope of the museum is expanding. The American Museum of Natural History is a landmark of Manhattan's Upper West Side, with a staff of more than 1,200. The museum sponsors over 100 special field expeditions each year. The Museum is famous for its habitat groups of African, Asian and North American mammals, for the full-size model of a Blue Whale suspended in the hall of oceans, for the Haida carved and painted war canoe from the Pacific Northwest, and for the ""Star of India"", the largest blue sapphire in the world. The circuit of a complete floor is devoted to vertebrate evolution, including the world-famous dinosaur replicas. The Museum's anthropological collections are also outstanding: Halls of Asian Peoples and of Pacific Peoples, of Man in Africa, Native Americans in the United States collections, general Native American collections, and collections from Mexico and Central America. One of the premiere botanical gardens in the United States, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx was modeled after the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. With 48 different gardens and plant collections, nature enthusiasts can easily spend a day admiring the serene cascade waterfall, wetlands, a 50 acre (200,000 m²) tract of old-growth oaks, American beeches, cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees — some more than two centuries old. Garden highlights include an 1890s-vintage, wrought-iron framed, ""crystal-palace style"" greenhouse; the Peggy Rockefeller memorial rose garden (originally laid out by Beatrix Farrand in 1916); a Japanese rock garden; a 37 acre (150,000 m²) conifer collection, extensive research facilities including a propagation center, 50,000-volume library, and a herbarium archive of hundreds of thousands of botanical specimens dating back more than a century. At the heart of the Garden are 40 acres (162,000 m²) of virgin woodlands which represent the last stretch of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest itself is split by the Bronx River and includes a riverine canyon and rapids, and along its shores sits the landmark Lorillard snuff-grinding mill dating back to the 1840s. The Brooklyn Children's Museum is a general purpose museum in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Founded in 1899, it was the first museum in the world to cater specifically to children. The museum is currently undergoing extensive renovation and expansion. The New York Hall of Science is a hands-on science and technology center with more than 400 exhibits exploring biology, chemistry, and physics. It is located in one of the few remaining structures of the 1964 New York World's Fair. The Rubin Museum of Art is a museum dedicated to the collection, display, and preservation of the art of the Himalayas and surrounding regions, especially that of Tibet. It is located at 150 West 17th Street between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue in the Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City. The Education Department at the Rubin Museum of Art fosters a deeper experience with the art of the Himalayas through close observation, discovery, thinking, and emotion and encourage visitors to consider the interplay between art and culture, and to make personal connections to visual art through meaningful interactions. Scientific research. New York is a center of scientific research, particularly in medicine and the life sciences. The city has 15 nationally leading academic medical research institutions and medical centers. These include Rockefeller University, Beth Israel Medical Center, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, Mount Sinai Medical Center (where Jonas Salk, developer of the vaccine for polio as an intern) and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the medical schools of New York University. In the Bronx, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a major academic center. Brooklyn also hosts one of the country's leading urban medical centers, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, an academic medical research institution and the oldest hospital-based medical school in the United States. Professor Raymond Vahan Damadian, a pioneer in magnetic resonance imaging research, was part of the faculty from 1967 to 1977 and built the first MRI machine, the Indomitable, there. The New York Structural Biology Center, in upper Manhattan, is a highly regarded federally funded medical research center with the largest and most advanced cluster of high-field research magnets in the United States. More than 50 bioscience companies and two biotech incubators are located in the city, with as many as 30 companies spun out of local research institutions each year. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is a component laboratory of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Earth-Sun Exploration Division and a unit of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. Current research at GISS emphasizes a broad study of global climate change. It also conducts basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs. Rockefeller University, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and physics. Founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1901, the university has been the site of many important scientific breakthroughs. Rockefeller scientists established that DNA is the chemical basis of heredity, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can cause cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, developed methadone maintenance for people addicted to heroin, devised the AIDS ""cocktail"" drug therapy, and identified the weight-regulating hormone leptin. Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners have been associated with the university, an amazing figure considering that Rockefeller University houses a relatively small amount of labs. The Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory in The Bronx, built with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New York State and New York City, and named for its largest private donor, is a major new research institution at the New York Botanical Garden opened in 2006. The laboratory is a pure research institution, with projects more diverse than research in universities and pharmaceutical companies. The laboratory's research emphasis is on plant genomics, the study of how genes function in plant development. One question scientists hope to answer is Darwin's ""abominable mystery""; when, where, and why flowering plants emerged. The laboratory's research also furthers the discipline of molecular systematics, the study of DNA as evidence that can reveal the evolutionary history and relationships of plant species. Staff scientists also study plant use in immigrant communities in New York City and the genetic mechanisms by which neurotoxins are produced in some plants, work that may be related to nerve disease in humans. A staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time from all over the world; since 1890s scientists from the New York Botanical Garden have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions across the planet to collect plants in the wild. At the plant chemistry laboratory chemical compounds from plants are extracted to create a library of the chemistry of the world's plants and stored in a DNA storage room with 20 freezers that store millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species. To protect them during winter power outages, there is a backup 300-kilowatt electric generator. "
wikipedia-3926004," Dinosaur Island  Dinosaur Island is an island that has appeared in various comic book series published by DC Comics. The island is not the same ""Dinosaur Island"" that appeared in ""Batman"" #35 (June 1946). That story by Bill Finger and Bob Kane involved a ""Dinosaur Island"" amusement park that contained robotic dinosaurs. Publication history. In ""Star-Spangled War Stories"" #90 (April 1960), Robert Kanigher created the Dinosaur Island that is in use in the DC universe today for his feature ""The War That Time Forgot"". It is located in the South Pacific of DC's main shared universe and it is populated by living dinosaurs. Fictional history. Dinosaur Island seems to have first been discovered by Enemy Ace in 1927 when he flew Bat Lash, Biff Bradley, General Joseph Stilwell, and ""Chop-Chop"" (presumably the father of the Blackhawks member) to the island on a mission for Chiang Kai-shek. The island had long been a legend to the Chinese people (known as Dragon Island at the time) and was believed to hold the mystical Swords of Fan. During this mission, the adventurers encounter Vandal Savage and Miss Fear, in addition to the dangerous dinosaurs. This tale appears in the ""Guns of the Dragon"" mini-series. During World War II, several United States submarines seemingly disappear after encountering an area of seismic disturbances. Marines land on a nearby island hoping to find survivors, but instead find that the earthquakes has awakened the remote island's resident dinosaur population. The prehistoric beasts had been preserved via suspended animation for centuries. With their weapons essentially useless, the squad of Marines barely escapes to tell the tale. Despite the presence of dinosaurs, the U.S. government consider the island a valuable strategic location in its war against Japan. Several expeditions and operations take place at the island. The island is also used as a proving ground for the automated soldiers designated G.I. Robot, which prove to be no match for the dinosaurs' ferocious might. The Creature Commandos, the Flying Boots, and the original Suicide Squad all take part in missions on the island during World War II. Post-War expeditions have theorized that the island exists in a state of temporal flux. Black Canary of the Birds of Prey lands on the island in modern times only to find it still inhabited by Japanese soldiers who are keeping Gunner and Sarge of ""The Losers"" in a P.O.W. camp. The ""Suicide Squad"" series reveals that a post-War mission to the island by Sgt. Rock (allegedly) and Bulldozer explains why they haven't aged as much since World War II due to temporal fluctuations. The veracity of this story may be in dispute, as Bulldozer later cryptically announces that Sgt. Rock died in World War II. Writer/artist Darwyn Cooke uses the island in his out-of-continuity series ', where he connects the island with the dawn of the Silver Age. In this series, the island is portrayed as the main antagonist, a sentient being called the Centre which has existed on the Earth since before the dawn of the human race. Feeling threatened by humanity's development of nuclear weapons, the Centre decides to end all life on Earth. In New Frontier, the Centre is portrayed as a living island with the ability to hover over great distances and spawn grotesque mutant dinosaurs to attack or defend itself. The island is currently the setting of the twelve-part series ""The War That Time Forgot"". "
wikipedia-3926218," Trimethadione  Trimethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant. It is most commonly used to treat epileptic conditions that are resistant to other treatments. Fetal trimethadione syndrome. If administered during pregnancy, fetal trimethadione syndrome may result causing facial dysmorphism (short upturned nose, slanted eyebrows), cardiac defects, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and mental retardation. The fetal loss rate while using trimethadione has been reported to be as high as 87%. Chemistry. Trimethadione, 3,5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, may be synthesized by methylating 5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione with dimethylsulfate. Starting 5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione is in turn synthesized by the cyclocondensation of the ester of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid with urea. "

wikipedia-3926430," Box of Rain  ""Box of Rain"" is a song by the Grateful Dead, from their 1970 album ""American Beauty"". The song was composed by bassist Phil Lesh and lyricist Robert Hunter, and sung by Lesh. In later years, the song was a favorite and the crowd would shout ""Let Phil sing!"" to hear the song. The song. ""Box of Rain"" is a song that is drawn from American folk and country musical roots. This is true of many Grateful Dead tunes, and most of the songs on ""American Beauty"" and their other 1970 release ""Workingman's Dead"". As the first song on ""American Beauty"", it was also the first Grateful Dead song released on record to feature Phil Lesh as the lead vocalist. The song also featured two musicians who are not in the band. Dave Torbert played bass, while Lesh played acoustic guitar. David Nelson (of New Riders of the Purple Sage) plays the lead guitar with a Fender Telecaster equipped with a Parsons/White B-Bender, while Jerry Garcia plays the piano. Lyrics. According to lyricist Hunter, Lesh ""wanted a song to sing to his dying father and had composed a piece complete with every vocal nuance but the words. If ever a lyric 'wrote itself,' this did—as fast as the pen would pull."" Lesh practiced the song driving to the nursing home where his father lay with terminal cancer. Many of the lyrics to this song are reminiscent of the song ""Ripple"", which opens the second side of the album. Images of water abound in both, as well as references to ""broken"" or ""hand-me-down"" ""thoughts"". The image of a ""box of rain"" originates, according to Hunter: ""By 'box of rain,' I meant the world we live on, but 'ball' of rain didn't have the right ring to my ear, so box it became, and 'I don't know who put it there.'"" The line ""moth before a flame"" echoes several proverbs, such as ""the fate of the moth in the flame""—Aeschylus, ""Fragments"" (Fragment #288). The line ""long long time to be gone and a short time to be there"" echoes the old-time classic ""Little Birdie"", which includes the line ""I've a short while to be here, and a long time to be gone."" In one of Carl Hiaasen's novels, the main character is in a shelter for children stranded by the hurricane, and in a particularly tender moment, sings Box of Rain to the child. Performance history. ""Box of Rain"" debuted on September 17, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City during the acoustic portion of the show. That performance was (perhaps significantly given the song's emotional burden for Lesh) its sole appearance for nearly two years. The Grateful Dead reintroduced it during the Fall of 1972 and played it on and off during 1972 and 1973, then dropping it and only reviving it 750+ performances later, playing it on March 20, 1986, at the Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. After that, the song was frequently played in response to chants from the audience. Before the death of Jerry Garcia, ""Box of Rain"" was the last song ever performed live at a Grateful Dead concert during the final encore at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 9, 1995. "
wikipedia-3926553," Same-sex marriage in Portugal  Same-sex marriage has been legal in Portugal since 5 June 2010. The government of Prime Minister José Sócrates introduced a bill for legalization in December 2009; it was passed by the Assembly of the Republic in February 2010. The bill was declared legally valid by the Portuguese Constitutional Court in April 2010. On 17 May 2010, President Aníbal Cavaco Silva ratified the law and Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and the eighth country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. The law was published in the official journal Diário da Republica on 31 May 2010 and became effective on 5 June 2010. Constitutional Court ruling. On 1 February 2006, a lesbian couple applied for a marriage licence. Their application was refused, but the couple, Teresa Pires and Helena Paixão, promised to challenge the ban in court, saying that it discriminated against them on the basis of sexual orientation, where this type of discrimination is banned by the 1976 constitution. Discrimination based on sexual orientation was made illegal in 2004. In May 2007, the court rejected the motion and they appealed to the Portuguese Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court received the case in July 2007. Helena and Teresa's lawyer, Luís Grave Rodrigues, presented their allegations on 19 October 2007, including seven legal opinions (""pareceres"") from Portuguese professors of law arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. On 31 July 2009, the Constitutional Court decided on a 3–2 vote that the constitution does not demand the recognition of same-sex marriage, but also does not oppose it, and that the decision must be made by the Assembly of the Republic. Legislative action. The BE and PEV's 2008 bills. Two bills to legalize same-sex marriage were presented to Parliament on 10 October 2008. The bills were introduced separately by the Left Bloc (BE) and Green Party (PEV). Both bills were rejected by parliament on opposition from the governing Socialist Party and the main opposition Social Democratic Party. The Government's 2009-2010 bill. Prime Minister José Sócrates stated on 18 January 2009 that, if re-elected in the September 2009 elections, he planned to introduce a bill to allow same-sex couples the right to marry. While the bill did not contemplate adoption, most LGBT organizations in Portugal supported the measure as an important step towards equality. In March 2009, Jorge Lacão, the Secretary of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, confirmed that the Socialist government intended to legalize same-sex marriage if re-elected in 2009. Manuela Ferreira Leite, the leader of the conservative Social Democratic Party, expressed her disapproval on the recognition of same-sex marriage. In May 2009, a grassroots movement, ""The Movement for Equality in Access to Civil Marriage"", was formed to campaign for the proposed same-sex marriage law. It attracted the support of several Portuguese celebrities, including Nobel Prize winner José Saramago and the Mayor of Lisbon António Costa. In October 2009, the newly re-elected José Sócrates made an assurance that the Socialist Party would move ahead with its campaign promise of same-sex marriage. The proposition received strong support from the Left Bloc, with its parliamentary leader presenting a proposed amendment to the Family Code which would make the definition of marriage gender-neutral. In mid-October 2009 Jorge Lacão said it would be likely that same-sex marriage would be legalised in early 2010. On 3 November 2009, José Ribeiro e Castro, a member of the CDS-PP, called for a referendum but the Socialist Party and Left Bloc rejected that idea. On 4 November Francisco Assis, the parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party, said same-sex marriage bill would be voted soon and confirmed that the bill would not allow same-sex couples to adopt children. On 17 December 2009, the Government approved the same-sex marriage bill. On 8 January 2010, after a debate, which included the intervention of the Prime Minister, the Portuguese Parliament passed the bill establishing same-sex marriage in its first reading. On 10 February, the Constitutional Affairs Committee of Parliament approved the bill. The final parliamentary vote took place on 11 February, with the bill being approved. On 24 February 2010, the Constitutional Affairs Committee sent the bill to the Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva.  On 13 March 2010, the President asked the Constitutional Court to verify whether the bill was constitutional. On 8 April 2010, the Portuguese Constitutional Court ruled (11–2) for the constitutionality of the bill, with three members concluding that the Constitution required the recognition of same-sex marriages. The ruling was published in the official gazette on 28 April, giving President Aníbal Cavaco Silva twenty days to sign, or veto, the bill.  On 17 May 2010, the President signed the bill. The law was published in Diário da República on 31 May 2010 and became effective on 5 June 2010. On 7 June Teresa Pires and Helena Paixão became the first lesbian same-sex couple to marry in Portugal. Same-sex adoption bills. On 24 February 2012, the parliament rejected two bills allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. However, on 17 May 2013, the Parliament passed a law allowing same-sex married couples to adopt their partner's children (i.e. step-child adoption). A law allowing full joint adoption was defeated on a 104-77 vote. Opposition. A number of groups opposed legalizing same-sex marriage during the process of discussion and continue to do so after ratification.  The Catholic Church in Portugal was opposed to the law and, while Portugal is a constitutional secular country, its status as a historically Catholic country was also a reason for the media sensationalism which heightened the controversy over the law.  On 8 January 2010, the parliament rejected a motion calling to the national referendum about same-sex marriage.  In February, 5,000 people demonstrated against legalization of same-sex marriage in a march in Lisbon.  On 13 May 2010, during an official visit to Portugal four days before the ratification of the law, Pope Benedict XVI, affirmed his opposition to same-sex marriage, describing it as ""insidious and dangerous"". Marriage norms. On 19 July 2010, Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado published the following rules on marriage: - Marriages conducted abroad must be transcribed by civil registries even if they were made before the approval date of marriage equality; - Marriages performed under alternative legislation to civil marriage, such as civil partnerships and civil unions, can not be transcribed; - Foreign nationals can marry even if marriage between same-sex couples is not recognized in their country of origin; - Same-sex foreign nationals can marry in Portugal without the need to establish residency; - Co-adoptions with same-sex couples performed abroad are not recognized in Portugal.

wikipedia-3926645," Ilie Dumitrescu  Ilie Dumitrescu (; born 6 January 1969 in Bucharest) is a Romanian former football player and coach, who was last manager of Steaua Bucureşti. A tricky forward, he shot to fame when his frontline partnership with Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Răducioiu led the Romania national team to the 1994 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal, eliminating Argentina en route. Football career. Dumitrescu joined the Steaua Bucureşti Academy in 1977 at the age of 8, making his way through all the youth teams and play for the first squad in April 1987. Even now he is renowned as the best player Steaua Bucureşti Academy ever produced along with Dan Petrescu. After making his debut in Divizia A he is loaned to FC Olt to gain more experience. At Steaua, a team which won the European Cup in the previous year was no room for an 18-year-old. But at FC Olt was a different story, as Dumitrescu did catch the first eleven from the very beginning, playing as left full back. This was not, however, a position he enjoyed, as he was a creative player. During his time with FC Olt, Mircea Lucescu the famous Romanian coach noticed him and predicted a fruitful career. It was just like Lucescu said. Once returned to Steaua Bucureşti, full with talent and ambition, he makes himself way to the first eleven at the age of only 19, becoming an important part of the squad, playing alongside big names such as Marius Lăcătuş and Gheorghe Hagi. In 1989 he makes debut for Romania, being used as a substitute in a game against Greece. From there the 1990 FIFA World Cup was only one step away, an opportunity he could not miss. Despite playing two games in Italy, Dumitrescu's services are not requested by a Western European club and he returned to play for his old team and, as captain, leads it to winning the championship in 1993 and playing in the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners' Cup in the same year. 1994 was a World Cup year and Dumitrescu was there, playing all the five games his team played in America and scoring two very important goals against Argentina in their famous 3–2 victory. The first after 11 minutes, a stunning free kick from a tight angle curled over the Argentine goal keeper. Minutes later Argentina had drew level through a penalty converted by Batistuta but slick passing in a counter-attack with Hagi resulted in another fine goal for Dumitrescu just 7 minutes after his first. Dumitrescu was also instrumental in the 3rd goal. He played the ball after a great run to Hagi who scored a vital goal which proved to be the winner. His performance opened the doors to the quarter-finals, the best performance Romania ever gained. Impressed by his performance in America, the representatives of Tottenham Hotspur were keen to offer him a contract. The North London side paid £2.6 million for Dumitrescu.[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-tottenham-sign-dumitrescu-for-pounds-26m-ardiles-shows-ambition-by-buying-romanian-world-cup-hero-and-chasing-two-brazilians-as-venables-prepares-for-latin-test-1416799.html] Just days after becoming a Tottenham Hotspur player, Dumitrescu found his name involved in a scandal. The British tabloid newspaper News of the World wrote an article about Dumitrescu chasing the services of prostitutes. The story later proved to be untrue, but Tottenham were unwilling to play Dumitrescu during the scandal and he was loaned out to Sevilla FC, with the La Liga side given an option to buy him during the loan. Dumitrescu had a good time in Southern Spain but the club baulked at the transfer fee Tottenham demanded. Dumitrescu returned to England. After playing in the first half of the 1995 – 96 Premiership season and failing to impress, Dumitrescu was sold to West Ham United, where Harry Redknapp wanted to make him the player he once was. Dumitrescu played only 10 games before encountering problems with his work permit. His contract with West Ham was broken, leaving him free agent. In the summer of 1996 he signed a contract with Club América in Mexico and then after one year he switched to their rivals Atlante F.C.. After two years in Mexico, Dumitrescu returned to Steaua Bucureşti in 1998. Halfway through the season he announced his retirement as a professional player aged only 29. Career as player agent. In 1998 he established a company called ""Sport & Business World"", as he was keen to start a new career as a player agent. It was however a very short career without any relevant success. Career as coach. In 2000 he was made manager of Oţelul Galaţi, from Romania's Divizia A. It was the beginning of a new career for Dumitrescu. From Galaţi he moved to FC Braşov and then Cypriot side Alki Larnaca in 2001–02. Here he won promotion to the Cypriot First Division and his team started the season very well, beating some of the best sides in Cyprus. However at the end of the season his team finished 11th. He then took the head coach role of the Romanian Under 21 side. But Dumitrescu lasted only 6 weeks in the role [http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=38123.html].  Subsequently he took control of FCM Bacău in Divizia A. However, after a disappointing season, Dumitrescu resigned in May 2003, leaving FCM Bacău in the relegation zone. Dumitrescu went again to Cyprus, this time for Apollon Limassol. By playing the Italian defensive system catenaccio, they won 12 of their first 13 matches and Dumitrescu was named the best manager in Cyprus for the year 2004. Dumitrescu soon moved on to his 6th club side, being named manager of the Greek side AEK Athens FC in February 2004. His roving managerial career continued as he left AEK to join Egaleo, also from the Greek Super League. The next three years found him at three other Greek clubs: Akratitos, Kallithea and PAOK. Dumitrescu was criticised for his style of play by PAOK fans. Despite only joining the club in February, he resigned in October. After 3 years without a club he became manager of Panthrakikos in May 2009, but was sacked after only one game. On 11 August 2010 he returned to Romania to take the manager post at Steaua Bucureşti only to leave the post six weeks later, citing ""I can't stay somewhere I'm not wanted,"". Dumitrescu had managed 13 teams in only 9 years. Trivia. Dumitrescu is an art lover and has his own art gallery in Bucharest. "
wikipedia-3926661," Florin Răducioiu  Florin Valeriu Răducioiu (born 17 March 1970 in Bucharest) is a former Romanian football striker, who played for Dinamo Bucureşti, A.C. Milan, Brescia Calcio, West Ham United, RCD Espanyol, VfB Stuttgart and A.S. Monaco. He played for Romania at the 1990 FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy, the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, and England's UEFA Euro 1996. Club career. Răducioiu was a product of Dinamo Bucureşti. Mircea Lucescu, former Dinamo coach, saw his skills and, as a feature of his philosophy towards football to promote young players, gave Răducioiu the chance to play at the highest level at the age of 17 years. By the beginning of 1988–1989, Răducioiu was first-choice in Lucescu's team. He made an impressive debut in European football by reaching the quarterfinals of the 1988–89 Cup Winners' Cup (ousted by U.C. Sampdoria in the quarterfinals, on away goals) and finishing second in the league. By 1989–90, Răducioiu was one of Romania's finest players, and that year was to be the most significant of his early career. He won the Romanian championship and the cup (hat-trick in the final against Steaua), reaching the semifinals of the 1989–90 Cup Winners' Cup, where Dinamo was defeated by RSC Anderlecht. After two seasons in Serie A, Răducioiu joined A.C. Milan in 1993–94, making only seven appearances and scoring two goals, but winning the UEFA Champions League. In 1994 he went to Spain to play for RCD Espanyol. Having scored his country's only goal in Euro96 manager Harry Redknapp signed him for West Ham United in 1996. Most famously, he scored a goal against Manchester United after being criticized by Harry Redknapp for going shopping with his wife at Harvey Nichols on a previous match day; a claim Răducioiu denies. Despite showing promise, he never adapted to the pace and competitive nature of the English game, making no real impact at Upton Park. He scored three goals during his spell with the Hammers. In addition to his goal against Manchester United he scored against Stockport County in the League Cup and Sunderland in the league. After his short underachieving spell at the East London club, having fallen out with manager Redknapp, he was transferred back to Espanyol, having scored just two goals in the Premier League. Răducioiu retired in 2004, after a short stint with modest French side US Créteil-Lusitanos. He had a short spell as a sports agent and as sporting director at Dinamo Bucharest. He is one of the two professional football players (alongside Christian Poulsen) to have plied his trade in the top five European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France). International career. Răducioiu debuted for the Romania in a friendly game against Israel on 25 April 1990, playing for 58 minutes before he was replaced. Răducioiu made his FIFA World Cup debut in 1990 against the Soviet Union at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, aged 20. Appearing in three games for Romania, he finished the tournament without scoring, and Romania fell to the Republic of Ireland in the second round, in a penalty shootout. Răducioiu had to wait until the last game of 1990 to score his first goal. He scored for Romania in a 6–0 victory over San Marino on 5 December in a qualifying match for Euro 1992, only to double his account in the next game in San Marino, as the Romanians won 3–1. The year 1993 would be significantly more successful for Răducioiu internationally, as he scored two goals against Czechoslovakia in Košice, even though Romania lost 5–2. Răducioiu's second goal came in the 55th minute, to tie the game at 2–2. However, Slovak player Peter Dubovsky scored a second half hat trick to beat Romania. His first goal came just four minutes after Răducioiu's second, and in the final eight minutes, Dubosky scored twice to win the game, even though the Czechoslovak had had two players sent off. An even greater success for Florin would come three months later when in Toftir, he managed to score all four of Romania's goals against the Faroe Islands, becoming the first Romanian player to score four goals for the national team in modern times, a record equaled only by Gheorghe Popescu in 1997 against Liechstenstein. Florin also scored a penalty kick against Belgium in the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup. In the last group game of qualifying, Răducioiu scored another goal against Wales finishing a nice team effort after a pass from Ilie Dumitrescu. This late goal, coming in the 83rd minute, sent Romania to the top of its group from the potential third place in the case that the game had ended 1–0. This win sent Romania to the 1994 World Cup. There, Răducioiu would help Romania to its most successful World Cup campaign ever, scoring four goals in the tournament. In 1994, he fared even better, scoring four goals in the tournament as Romania advanced to the quarterfinals. Răducioiu scored two goals against Colombia during the qualifying round, and later plugged two more in a quarterfinal loss to Sweden. Due to rule changes, had the match against Sweden been played two years later, Romania would have advanced to the semifinals; Răducioiu's second goal was the first scored during extra time, and under later rules, this tally would have been considered a golden goal (instead, Kennet Andersson also scored in the additional period, tying the game, and Sweden eventually won 5–4 on penalties, as Răducioiu scored on the first penalty attempt for Romania). In Euro 1996, as Romania lost all three group stage matches, Răducioiu netted the nation's only goal, in a 1–2 loss against Spain. "
wikipedia-3926700," Lapel  Lapels are the folded flaps of cloth on the front of a jacket or coat, and are most commonly found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric around the back of the neck. There are three basic forms of lapels: notched, peaked and shawl. Notched lapels, the most common, are usually seen on business suits. Peaked lapels are more formal, and nearly always used on double breasted jackets or coats. Shawl lapels are usually carried by dinner jackets. Types of lapel. Notched lapel. The notched lapel (American English), step lapel or step collar (British English) is sewn to the collar at an angle, creating a step effect. This is the standard on single breasted suits, and is used on nearly all suit jackets, blazers, and sports jackets. The notched lapel double-breasted jacket is a rare setting. The size of the notch can vary, and a small notch is called ""fishmouth"". This was the first type of lapel to appear. Peaked lapel. The peaked lapel (American English), double breasted style lapel or pointed lapel (British English), is the most formal, featuring on double-breasted jackets, all formal coats such as a tailcoat or morning coat, and also commonly with a dinner jacket (both single and double breasted). In the late 1920s and 1930s, the single breasted peaked lapel jacket was considered a very stylish design. The feature was carried into day clothing by the increasing popularity of the peaked dinner jacket. The ability to properly cut peak lapels on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors. Shawl lapel. The shawl lapel, roll collar, or shawl collar is a continuous curve. Originally seen on the Victorian smoking jacket, it is now most common on the dinner jacket (tuxedo). This similarly began as informal eveningwear, and was then made in both more and less formal versions, depending on the situation in which it was to be used. Lapel features. Lapels have a buttonhole on the left, which is intended to hold a boutonnière, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. To hold the flower properly, a loop is fixed to the back of the lapel. For symmetry, double breasted suits often have a button hole on each lapel. A lapel pin is also sometimes worn. The width of the lapel is a widely varying aspect of suits, and has changed widely over the years. Some designers maintain however that most stylish lapel width does not change, and that the lapel ""should extend to just a fraction less than the halfway mark between the collar and shoulder line"". Origin. The ""usual"" style of lapel (the notched lapel) originated in older types of jacket or coat that buttoned to the neck, by unbuttoning and turning back the upper part of the closure at an angle indoors or in hot weather, and then removing the upper buttons. The upper points are derived from the end corners of the collar. This can be duplicated by similarly turning back the closure in a modern button-to-the-neck garment such as an outdoor coat or a boilersuit. Sometimes when caught outside in bad weather in a lapelled jacket and nothing over it, its wearer may unfold the lapels and hold them that way to temporarily reproduce the ancestral to-the-neck closure. As tailcoats evolved rapidly among the wealthy during the Regency period, various styles of closure saw popularity, from fastenings at the top, the middle, or even hanging open. The turn-down collar popular on earlier garments like the frock was succeeded by long lapels folded down to below the waist (fashionably tightly nipped in). Invariably, there were long rows of buttons down the front, most of which did not fasten; in fact even into the late Victorian era, all frock coats had a long row of button holes on the lapel, long since obsolete. As buttoning styles changed, the loosely folded front of the coat correspondingly shifted shape, and the ""V"" then formed by the meeting of the fold and the collar continues now in the traditional shape of notched and peaked lapels, both of which originate from that period. Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased and their form was more static, varying only in details such as height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then lengthened to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period was the use of the revers in the construction of the lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch to morning coats and lounge suits. Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts. Some historians of dress such as Bernard Rudofsky have ridiculed the evolution of jacket lapels into ""vastly unnecessary flaps"" and ""decorative rudiments,"" while others have celebrated the transformation of lapels into ""fetishes"" as part and parcel of fashion as expression. Lapelless jackets. Though less common among men's suits in the west, other jacket styles feature no lapels. Jackets with mandarin collars, also called stand collars, band collars or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, such as the British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and ghillie collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit. "
wikipedia-3926798," Galactic Milieu Series  The Galactic Milieu Series of science fiction novels by Julian May is the sequel (and prequel) to her ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"". It comprises four novels: ""Intervention"", ""Jack the Bodiless"", ""Diamond Mask"" and ""Magnificat"". The series involves several religious and philosophical themes, including references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The novels. The series begins with ""Intervention: A Root Tale to the Galactic Milieu and a Vinculum between it and The Saga of Pliocene Exile"" (ISBN 0-395-43782-2, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987). This was released in one volume in the UK, but in mass market paperback in the USA as two volumes: ""Surveillance"" and ""Metaconcert"". May calls ""Intervention"" a ""vinculum"", or link-tale, between the ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"" and the Milieu trilogy proper. However, it is a near-essential introduction to the Milieu trilogy as well as a balanced stand-alone work.  ""Jack the Bodiless"" (ISBN 0-679-40950-5, New York: Knopf, 1991) is the first book of the trilogy proper, followed by ""Diamond Mask"" (ISBN 0-679-43310-4, New York: Knopf, 1994), and ""Magnificat"" (ISBN 0-679-44177-8, New York: Knopf, 1996). Religious and philosophical themes. The series includes multiple references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, including the concepts of the Omega Point and the Noosphere, which are applied to May's description of galactic mental Unity. The series title echoes Teilhard's 1957 book ""Le Milieu Divin"". The Remillard family are Catholic, and on several occasions family members discuss their faith. The most notable example occurs in the first part of Chapter 24 of ""Jack the Bodiless"", where Teresa Kendall explains Christianity to her unborn son. ""Jack the Bodiless"" begins with a set of quotations, including the Spanish proverb ""God writes straight with crooked lines."" This proverb summarises the plot of the whole series, in which tragedies and disasters (particularly the Metapsychic Rebellion) result in ultimate good (particularly the repentance and transformation of Marc Remillard, through which the Galactic Milieu is formed). The Rebellion is thus a ""Felix culpa"". Julian May's description of ""metapsychic"" abilities explicitly refers to the concepts of auras (particularly in Part III of ""Intervention"") and chakras (particularly in discussing the feeding of the ""Hydra""). Aspects of May's Universe. Alien races. The Lylmik are the oldest race in the Galaxy, having been shepherded to mental Unity or ""coadunation"" by the entity known as Atoning Unifex. They created the Galactic Milieu and in turn mentored the Krondaku, Gi, Simbiari, and Poltroyans. The Krondaku are large tentacled invertebrate ""monsters"", the Gi are feathered hermaphrodites with a well-developed aesthetic sense, the Simbiari are green and slimy, while the Poltroyans are small purple humanoids who most resemble human beings both physically and mentally. Planets. Events of the novels take place on several planets: Earth; the Concilium Orb, an artificial planet constructed by the Lylmik, and the seat of the galactic Council; Hibernia, an Irish-dominated human colony; Caledonia, a Scottish-dominated human colony; Denali, a snow-covered planet popular as a holiday destination; and the human colony of Okanagon. Apart from the home planets and colonies of the alien races, a number of other planets are also mentioned in passing. ""Metapsychic"" powers. Julian May describes five categories of ""metapsychic"" powers in the series: creation, coercion, psychokinesis, farsensing and redaction. Each of these powers is associated with a colour, as originally described in the ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"". Creativity is the ability to create illusions and manipulate energy. In its strongest form, it can involve permanent changes of matter from one kind to another, as when Jack creates flowers from waste. The same level of power can also be used to create mental lasers, and the ""Metapsychic Rebellion"" causes considerable damage with such mental weapons, produced by brains amplified with cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment. Rogi possess creative abilities, though unreliable ones, and these occasionally help him in moments of need. Coercion is the ability of metapsychic mind control over other people. For example, in ""Magnificat"", Denis uses metapsychic coercion to manipulate Rogi to climb Mt. Washington. Psychokinesis (PK) is the ability to move physical objects through space metapsychically. Farsensing is the ability to communicate with others and to sense remotely via metapsychic means, much like telepathy, clairvoyance, or remote viewing. In ""Intervention"", the ability of farsensing (initially called ""ultrasensing"") to locate hidden weapons becomes geopolitically important. Finally, Redaction provides the ability for mental healing. Dorothea MacDonald has very strong redactive powers. These five mental powers can be latent, meaning that, while present, they cannot be consciously used. On the other hand, operant powers are available for conscious, controlled use. Higher capabilities within operancy include Master, Grand Master, and Paramount Grand Master levels. Jack, Marc, and Dorothea are all (eventually) Paramounts. Julian May describes collaborative as well as individual mental powers. A metaconcert is a synchronised use of mental powers by more than one person, as when Jack and Dorothea tackle the geological problems of Caledonia. The ultimate extension of such collaboration is the mental Unity which the Lylmik are fostering in the galaxy. Plots of the novels. Intervention. The book follows the Remillard family of New Hampshire from the years immediately after World War II through an increasingly turbulent world, in which various ""metapsychic"" humans manoeuvre in secret to direct the destiny of the human race. The Remillards play a central role in this story, though the narrator, Rogatien ""Uncle Rogi"" Remillard, is often an alienated observer rather than a central participant. At the same time, the earth is under surveillance by representatives of a galactic culture (the ""Galactic Milieu"" of the series title), who monitor the human race's fitness for admission into the wider galactic community. Interwoven with this narrative are glimpses of the time after the main action of the series, drawing together threads from it and the Pliocene Exile series. ""Intervention"" climaxes with the Great Intervention, the revelation of this wider galactic society. This sets the stage for the more focused story May has to tell in the remainder of the series.  This deals with the history of several family lines with strong metapsychic potential, especially the Remillards. This line begins with twins Rogatien (Rogi) and Donatien (Don), whose mother died giving birth to them. They discover that they have unusual mental abilities (which admittedly turn out to be far less than those of later generations of metapyschics). Rogi is a milder mannered man, who becomes sterile through mumps. Don is distrustful and malicious, but handsome and charming, and steals Rogi's girlfriend Marie Madeleine ""Sunny"" Fabré. From an early age, Rogi was visited by an entity he called ""the Family Ghost"", and it is this entity who commanded Rogi to write his memoirs. The Ghost first rescued Rogi as a child, and many years later rescued Don after Rogi tried to kill him in a rage for stealing his girlfriend. The Ghost tells Rogi that he is sterile, but would have an important role in guiding Don's key descendants. Rogi becomes close to Don and Sunny's firstborn child Denis. Denis is a precocious child, and quickly learns to master many metapsychic faculties, greatly exceeding those of Rogi and Don, in addition to excelling intellectually. Rogi becomes like a real father to him, while Don is always out getting drunk at night. Rogi and Denis start to search for people with similar powers. Don become jealous of Denis's powers but, though Denis's young coercion, is rendered unable to hurt him. Meanwhile, Don and Sunny raise their nine other children, including the monstrously evil second-born Victor, who terrorizes his younger siblings and suppresses their mental powers. Don focuses upon Victor as Denis grows up, seeming to shape him into a vigorous athletic counterpart to Denis's intellectual existence. The more sinister nature of Victor's influences becomes apparent in later volumes. Don reacts against Rogi's influence upon his children, but cannot overcome Denis's attachment to his uncle. Rogi leaves for a job as a hotel manager, where Denis can visit during the holidays. Rogi worries about Denis's education, as his local school is not challenging, but Don does not see education as something to invest in for his children - especially for Denis. Rogi learns of a Jesuit monastic school and manages to get Don to allow him to send Denis there. This leads to Denis attending Dartmouth College due to a new program for ""special students."" He becomes prominent in many fields, particularly psychology and the understanding of ""metapsychic"" abilities, eventually becoming the ""Grandfather of Metapsychology"". Subsequent research yields results in many places in the world and Denis organizes yearly meetings within the secret metapsychic community.  At the same time, Victor is plotting with the sociopathic gangster metapsychic Kieran O'Connor to bring down the government with their metapsychic powers. This culminates in a showdown at the end of the book where Denis calls out to all the present and absent metapsychics of goodwill to join in a ""metaconcert"" against an attack by Victor and Kieran. The watching Milieu agents invisible in the sky hear this call, and the subsequent metaconcert, and therefore intervene. Victor, meanwhile, goes after Rogi who has learned too much. Through his metapsychic power of ""creativity"", Rogi uses a mental laser to put Victor into a vegetative state. Rogi never understood how he could have overcome such a powerful metapsychic as Victor, until the Family Ghost reveals decades later that he assisted. Jack the Bodiless. As the Milieu trilogy proper begins with ""Jack the Bodiless"", humankind, led by the Remillard family, is awaiting acceptance into the Galactic Milieu. With Earth's government being overseen by one of the alien races (Simbiari) ultimately under the authority of the Galactic Milieu, harsh laws (including eugenics laws) are instituted, which fuels feelings of suspicion in both earth's normal and metapsychic population. Denis by now has fathered many children, the youngest of whom (Paul) is elected leader of Humanity. Marc, (Paul's firstborn with Teresa — a grandchild of Don's via Rogi's quondam amoureuse, Elaine) is the most powerful human metapsychic known at that time, who also has a genius-level intellect. Paul & Teresa started Marc's education while he was still in utero, which was by then becoming an accepted practice.  Also born, at Victor's deathbed, was Fury. This is a sociopathic entity that has its own agenda for the Galactic Milieu and the Remillard family in particular. Fury in turn ‘created’ from the minds of five unborn metapsychic fetuses, a physical monster called The Hydra to do its bidding. Following a number of failed pregnancies' Teresa has her reproductive license revoked (under the interdict, metaphysics must have permission to have children). Teresa then loses her ability to sing, and thereby loses Paul’s attention.  Sometime later Teresa regains her voice and becomes illegally pregnant with the last of their children, and when Marc farsenses emotional problems over her pregnancy he visits his mother to investigate. Upon learning of his mother’s pregnancy, Marc takes it upon himself to hide Teresa and his future brother in the icy Canadian wilderness. Marc realises that Rogi is the only family member that would be empathetic enough to help, and recruits him for this purpose. Marc fakes a “canoeing accident” so that the Remillard family and the Magistratum of the Milieu believe them dead, and after many months in the wilderness, Rogi assists Teresa in the birth, and Jon Remillard, the future “Saint Jack the Bodiless”, is born. Although Jack has the outward appearance of a normal human child, his intellect and mental prowess rapidly set him apart from the rest of humankind, as does the fact that his body begins to generate inoperable and incurable tumours that are slowly overwhelming him. Despite the fact that Jack possesses each of the five higher mindpowers (also known as metafaculties) at the highest known level (Paramount Grand Master), he is incapable of effecting change in his own physiology. The Lylmik, the oldest and most powerful of the alien races in the milieu, veto his euthanasia and leave it up to Jack. An attack by Fury on Jack as he lies in his hospital room, leads to an evolutionary jump in which Jack discards his physical form and metamorposes into his final state as a disembodied brain. Diamond Mask. The second book deals mainly with Dorothea MacDonald on the Scottish world of Caledonia. Dorothea lives with her father and her brother amid several step brothers and sisters. Dorothea's mother and other relatives are killed in an attack by the entity known as Hydra, a “metapsychic entity” that Fury uses as an assassin. Hydra consists of four (formerly five) metapsychics who can mind-meld into a powerful vampiric metaconcert when not leading their normal lives. After this, Dorothea realises that she is a latent metapsychic — one with inherent potential but mental blocks that prevent her using her powers, as opposed to the “operant” metapsychics. However, she starts to overcome her blocks and is able to use her mind to protect and heal herself. Meanwhile, Paul Remillard is preparing for Human entry into the Milieu and is in line to become the inaugural First Magnate of the Concillium. When his rival's wife is killed after being shoved into a trash compactor in an apparent suicide disguising her murder by Hydra, a hold is put on Human entry into the Milieu for 1,000 Galactic Days. The Krondaku investigators suspect the Remillards to be involved. Dorothea turns out to be another Paramount, with incredibly strong redactive powers and resistance to metapsychic probes and attacks. Young Marc Remillard is not able to probe her mind even when his powers are enhanced by the cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment that he has invented, although CE allows him to resist counterprobes. She even manages to slip into Denis's mind, but he quickly throws her out before she can find out much. Dorothea and Jack have a role in saving an inhabited planet from a diatreme eruption, using their paramount powers aided by CE. But her lower face is terribly deformed in this heroic act, so after this she always wears a diamond-studded half-mask, and acquires her nickname “Diamond Mask”. Magnificat. By the third book in the series, Marc has matured into a highly capable metapsychic and is regarded as a Paramount. Through manipulated dreams, Marc conceives an idea called 'Mental Man' which would create a new subspecies of Man called ""Homo summus"". It would use selective breeding, surgical modification, mental training (through induced pain) and technological enhancement to create hundreds of humans with the powers — and disembodiment — of Marc's younger brother Jack. This project has been kept highly secret for several years, but peers and competitors of Marc begin to get suspicious. He develops several increasingly powerful CE devices. These amplify a human's inherent metapsychic ability by orders of magnitude. The CE device is discussed in the debates of the Concilium, and is deemed too dangerous to be generally used. Marc disagrees, his research continues in secret although outlawed, and culminates in devices capable of 600x amplification. Marc's increasing ambition draws him to side with a rebel faction of the Concillium — those that do not wish to join 'Unity' with the other races and therefore with the Galactic Mind itself. The rebel faction determinedly opposes this as they believe humans will lose their individuality and privacy and will become thralls to the other races.  By this time, only two out of the original five Hydra units remain, Parnell Remillard and Madeleine Remillard — Marc's cousin and sister (it is revealed that the Hydra heads were the unborn children present at the vigil around Victor, where Fury corrupted their infant minds). One wet night, Anne Remillard — a staunch loyalist and advocate of Unity — visits Rogi's bookshop. She has deduced that Denis is Fury. Rogi doubts this but when Anne is attacked and nearly killed, he realises that he must inform Jack and Dorothea of the identity of Fury. The only opportune moment seems their upcoming wedding.  After Rogi divulges the information on Fury/Denis to Jack and Dorothea, the Remillard dynasty assembles in order to 'exorcise' Denis. Denis is tricked into making himself vulnerable, and they attempt to remove the Fury element of his psyche. This goes disastrously wrong, and Denis/Fury vanishes. He is later realised to have ""D-Jumped"" — teleported — a first for man and most aliens, although it is revealed in the Saga of the Pliocene Exile that the Shipspouses of Lene had this ability.  Marc, previously totally chaste, falls madly in love with Cyndia Muldowney, the daughter of Rory, an opponent of Paul's, and the two marry. After several events, Denis manages to briefly gain control from his Fury persona, and communicates with Cyndia. He reveals that the Mental Man babies (which were created from Marc and Madeleine's sperm and eggs) have become hundreds of Hydra by Madeleine's influence. Denis D-Jumps inside the complex and destroys all the children. Marc is dumbstruck, yet finds a way to terminate the Hydra-infested project while retaining the possibility of a new start. He mind-lasers Madeleine, aided by the CE, and has her frozen so that her ovaries may be used.  Denis travels to Mt. Washington, where he has manipulated Rogi using metapsychic coercion to journey to the summit. Bad weather hits the mountain and Rogi is shepherded into a shack by his nephew. Denis persuades Rogi to kill him with his yogic technique, as he fears Fury will regain control. None of his children could manage that even though they have strong metapsychic powers, because children seem to have a block against using their powers to attack their parents. And as Denis regards Rogi as a father figure, he hopes that Fury cannot use his powers against Rogi. Rogi feebly manages to start the technique but cannot muster the power. However, Fury does regain control and tries to kill Rogi physically, since the mental block against using metapsychic powers against parent figures does indeed apply. This act of violence gives Rogi the necessary desperation to trigger his operancy, and he vaporises Denis, to his great grief.  Marc in the meantime, continues his quest for Mental Man, but realises that the Metapsychic rebellion is too near for Mental Man to be present to ensure victory. Cyndia discovers Marc's plans, is horrified, and decides to remove all available sources of the new Mental Man. She acquires a sonic apparatus that will render Marc sterile, and triggers it by a telepathic command. However, Marc detects this impulse, realises what the device has done, and kills Cyndia by reflex. He mourns more because of his sterility than the loss of the wife he once loved greatly. Paul, father of Jack and Marc, is the leader of the Pro-Unity camp, and Jack decides to campaign against the rebels. As tension builds and several children start to co-adunate, the rebels' long-laid plans move into action. Marc has equipped hundreds of individuals with his CE devices, and his colleagues arm many ships. The rebels decide to demonstrate their power by destroying a planet — Molakar: the Krondaku planet from which the intervention was staged. Billions die in several seconds as the joined minds of the Rebels superheat the crust of the planet. A massive wave of metapsychic suffering and grief overwhelms the minds of the entire milieu. The response is not what Marc expects. Jack, Dorothea and his father, Paul, decide to confront him peacefully and will not let him take war to the galaxy. Marc decides to fight regardless, but the three pacifists call out to all the metapsychics in the galaxy to help join in Unity and stop the Rebels. One of Marc's main allies is Patricia Castellane, the leader of the cosmopolitan planet Okanagon. During the attack, the rebels accidentally lose control of another explosive device and it explodes, setting off Okanagon's unstable crust. The resultant geological catastrophe kills the entire population of two billion people. Jack telepathically asks his once-idolized brother, ""What have you done?!"" Jack and Dorothea manage to halt the rebel fleet, thanks to their ability to conjoin the powers of all the pro-Milieu operant humans. But these two and Paul die as a result. Many of the Rebels are also killed when their CEs overload, and Marc and a number of the leaders are badly hurt. The deaths of the people of Okanagon, however, propel humanity into the state of mental co-ordination (called ""coadunation"") which is the precursor to a benevolent joining of minds across the galaxy which the member races of the Milieu refer to as Unity. After the rebel faction is defeated, their leaders flee through a unique one-directional gate in France 6 million years back in time, to the Pliocene period. They were aided by a Lylmik who was powerful enough even to freeze Marc in his tracks, as he had done many years previously when Marc was a boy. There they stay in exile, and the events of the Saga of Pliocene Exile take place. Marc Remillard survives all those years (thanks to his ""immortality gene"", a trait shared by most members of the Remillard clan in differing degrees) and eventually evolves to the 3rd stage of mental evolution, where he brings purpose to the Lylmik to create the milieu. He thoroughly repents of his great evil, and becomes the enlightened leader of the same galactic society that starts the intervention, calling himself Atoning Unifex. Marc is evidently the Lylmik who appeared to his past self, and turns out to be the incorporeal ""Family Ghost"" who appears to Rogi for several years, driving him to finish his memoirs as a unique document of the Metapsychic rebellion. Marc, according to the family tree, passes on to the next stage of existence / evolution leaving Rogi to be healed and back in a relationship with Elaine. Some of the Lylmik have human bodies now as well and the future of what happens next is, as yet, unknown. "
wikipedia-3926881," Slab allocation  Slab allocation is a memory management mechanism intended for the efficient memory allocation of kernel objects which displays the desirable property of eliminating fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. Slab allocation was first introduced in the Solaris 2.4 kernel by Jeff Bonwick and now is widely used by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD and Linux (where it was the default allocator until 2.6.23 when SLUB allocation became the default). Basis. The primary motivation for slab allocation is that the initialization and destruction of kernel data objects can actually outweigh the cost of allocating memory for them. As object creation and deletion are widely employed by the kernel, mitigating overhead costs of initialization can result in significant performance gains. The notion of object caching was therefore introduced in order to avoid the invocation of functions used to initialize object state. With slab allocation, memory chunks suitable to fit data objects of certain type or size are preallocated. The slab allocator keeps track of these chunks, known as caches, so that when a request to allocate memory for a data object of a certain type is received it can instantly satisfy the request with an already allocated slot. Destruction of the object, however, does not free up the memory, but only opens a slot which is put in the list of free slots by the slab allocator. The next call to allocate memory of the same size will return the now unused memory slot. This process eliminates the need to search for suitable memory space and greatly alleviates memory fragmentation. In this context a slab is one or more contiguous pages in the memory containing pre-allocated memory chunks. Implementation. Understanding the slab allocation algorithm requires defining and explaining some terms: When a program sets up a cache, it allocates a number of objects to the slabs associated with that cache. This number depends on the size of the associated slabs. Slabs may exist in one of the following states : Initially, the system marks each slab as ""empty"". When the process calls for a new kernel object, the system tries to find a free location for that object on a partial slab in a cache for that type of object. If no such location exists, the system allocates a new slab from contiguous physical pages and assigns it to a cache. The new object gets allocated from this slab, and its location becomes marked as ""partial"". The allocation takes place quickly, because the system builds the objects in advance and readily allocates them from a slab. Slabs. A slab is the amount that a cache can grow or shrink by. It represents one memory allocation to the cache from the machine, and whose size is customarily a multiple of the page size. A slab must contain a list of free buffers (or bufctls), as well as a list of the bufctls that have been allocated (in the case of a large slab size).  Large slabs. These are for caches that store objects that are not less than 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. The reason for the large slabs having a different layout from the small slabs is that it allows large slabs to pack better into page-size units, which helps with fragmentation. The slab contains a list of bufctls, which are simply controllers for each buffer that can be allocated (a buffer is the memory that the user of a slab allocator would use). Small slabs. The small slabs contain objects that are less than 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. These small slabs need to be optimized further from the logical layout, by avoiding using bufctls (which would be just as large as the data itself and cause memory usage to be much greater). A small slab is exactly one page, and has a defined structure that allows bufctls to be avoided. The last part of the page contains the 'slab header', which is the information needed to retain the slab. Starting at the first address of that page, there are as many buffers as can be allocated without running into the slab header at the end of the page. Instead of using bufctls, we use the buffers themselves to retain the free list links. This allows the small slab's bufctl to be bypassed.  "
wikipedia-3926894," Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs  The Under Secretary for Political Affairs is the third ranking position in the United States Department of State, after the Secretary and the Deputy Secretaries. While the positions of Secretary and Deputy Secretary are occupied by political appointees, the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs is usually (but not always) occupied by a career Foreign Service Officer, making the occupant the highest-ranking member of the Foreign Service. The current Under Secretary is Wendy Sherman. The Under Secretary serves as the day-to-day manager of overall regional and bilateral policy issues, and oversees the bureaus for Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, the Near East, South Asia, the Western Hemisphere, International Organizations, and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. The Under Secretary is advised by Assistant Secretaries of the geographic bureaus, who guide U.S. diplomatic missions within their regional jurisdiction.  The political bureaus were first overseen in 1949 by a Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Prior to the creation of the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs assisted the Secretary and Under Secretary of State in the formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy. After August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs served as a focal point for interdepartmental relations, especially those dealing with politico-military issues. During 1969, the Department discontinued the position and created a new Bureau for Politico-Military Affairs, which exists today as the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs under another Under Secretary. Wendy R. Sherman was appointed to this post by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 21, 2011. "
wikipedia-3926896," Chest injury  A chest injury is any form of physical injury to the chest including the heart and lungs. Chest injuries account for 25% of all deaths from traumatic injury. Typically chest injuries are caused by blunt mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions or penetrating mechanisms such as stabbings. Classification. Chest injuries can be classified as blunt or penetrating. Blunt and penetrating injuries have different pathophysiologies and clinical courses.  Specific types of injuries include: Diagnosis. Most blunt injuries are managed with relatively simple interventions like tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and chest tube insertion. Diagnosis of blunt injuries may be more difficult and require additional investigations such as CT scanning. Penetrating injuries often require surgery, and complex investigations are usually not needed to come to a diagnosis. Patients with penetrating trauma may deteriorate rapidly, but may also recover much faster than patients with blunt injury. "

wikipedia-3938336," Golden Corral  Golden Corral is an American family-style restaurant chain serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, and featuring a large buffet and grill offering numerous hot and cold dishes, a carving station and their Brass Bell Bakery. It is a privately held company headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, with locations in forty states. History. In 1971, James Maynard and William F. Carl Gavone Siamese conceived the idea that became Golden Corral after several unsuccessful attempts to acquire a franchise with other companies. Golden Corral was incorporated in 1972 and the first Golden Corral Family Steak House opened on January 3, 1973, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The company has since expanded to over 480 locations across the United States; about 100 of them are company-owned. The others are franchised stores. Gross sales are over $1.53 billion. The company had more than 500 restaurants by 1987. That year, they decided to begin franchising by licensing 55 distressed restaurants to their most successful general managers. Because of poor training, nationwide concerns about the consumption of red meat, and a shift in market shares to upscale restaurants, sales were falling. The company added salad bars to all of its location, sacrificed seating in most, and in others sacrificed part of the parking lot to make additions to the buildings. In 1991, the first seven ""Metro Market"" concept restaurants opened. They were and seated between 400 and 450 customers. These new Golden Corral restaurants more than doubled the size of the old, which were typically with a capacity of 175 people. There was the addition of the Brass Bell Bakery, named for the brass bell which rang every fifteen minutes to signal that fresh bread, rolls, and pastries were coming out of the oven. An expanded buffet, dubbed the Golden Choice Buffet, was also added, which had a new layout to showcase its items. The location of these new restaurants, the majority of which were in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and North Carolina, was also a change for the company, moving away from small towns and into metropolitan areas. In 2001, system-wide annual sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time. As of 2008, there were 485 restaurants in 41 states. In April 2009, Golden Corral entered New England with a restaurant in Springfield, Massachusetts. The company's most recent restaurant concept, called ""Strata"", was rolled out during the mid-2000s in an effort to bring more of the food preparation into view of the guests. In all locations, guests serve themselves, including requesting made-to-order items such as Belgian waffles, omelets and char-broiled steaks. Many locations offer a ""To-Go"" service, which allows customers to pack anything they want into a ""To-Go"" container and then pay for it by the pound. Many restaurants also offer reserved parking. Controversy. Salmonella outbreak. In 2003, an outbreak of salmonella was linked to a Golden Corral restaurant in Kennesaw, Georgia. Twenty-three people were affected by the outbreak. The salmonella bacteria was found in a floor drain, leading health inspectors to believe that it had been washed off of equipment earlier. No original source was found. A similar outbreak occurred in Wyoming and Orlando, Florida, in late 2012. Norovirus outbreak. In 2012, an outbreak of norovirus was linked to a Golden Corral restaurant in Casper, Wyoming. Over 344 illnesses, with 282 primary cases, were reported by the Wyoming state epidemiologist. The virus got a push from 31 sickened food handlers at the restaurant who mostly kept working their normal shifts. Allegations of improper food storage. On July 1st, 2013 a YouTube video was uploaded alleging that during a health inspection, the Port Orange, Florida location was improperly storing prepared and raw food next to their dumpster. Items included, among other things: pot roast, gravy, hamburger patties, and raw baby back ribs. These items were still on their prep trays and bins, as well as on a speed rack. The employee in the video alleges that this is a common practice for the restaurant, and insinuated that the food was to be served later that day. On July 8, 2013, Golden Corral posted a response on YouTube, saying that the food was never served to the customers, the employee in the video was trying to make money off of the video, and the manager of the location has been fired. Philanthropy. Between 2001 and 2007, in support of the Veterans Day holiday, Golden Corral served more than 2.5 million free meals to active duty and retired military personnel, and has raised more than US$4.1 million for disabled veterans through its Military Appreciation Monday. The company also sponsors Children's Miracle Network with each store donating money to local children's hospitals. Internet domain. In January 2002, the National Arbitration Forum ordered that the domain ""www.goldencorralrest.com"" be transferred to Golden Corral from an unapproved domain service based in Russia. Racing sponsorship. From 2004 to 2006 the restaurant sponsored the Golden Corral 500, a NASCAR Sprint Cup spring race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and was the main sponsor for the 2009 season of ""WindTunnel with Dave Despain"" on Speed Channel. Golden Corral also sponsored the No. 28 Yates Racing Ford of Travis Kvapil during select NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events in the 2009 season. Dave Blaney was to use Golden Corral as one of his sponsors for the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. In 2011, Golden Corral sponsored two drivers for the Daytona 500. Dave Blaney earned primary sponsorship for his Tommy Baldwin Racing entry. Brian Keselowski received associate sponsorship after his surprise finish in the qualifying races. If a Golden Corral-sponsored driver finishes in the top ten, the chain honors a ""Kids Eat Free"" promotion. Dave Blaney finished third at the 2011 fall Talladega race. J.J. Yeley finished tenth at the 2013 Daytona 500, a promotion Golden Corral honors after the remaining races where the chain is the primary sponsor of the No. 36 Tommy Baldwin Racing entry. "
wikipedia-3938339," Short People  ""Short People"" is a song by Randy Newman from his 1977 album ""Little Criminals"". The verses and chorus are lyrically constructed as a pointed attack on the short. The bridge (sung by Glenn Frey), in contrast, states ""short people are just the same as you and I."" Newman interprets the song to be about ""prejudice"", as was widely thought, but added that it was ""about a lunatic"". As with many of his songs, such as ""Rednecks"", Newman wrote the song from the point of view of a biased narrator. Like Dire Straits' 1985 hit single ""Money for Nothing"" which used the same lyrical technique, the song was misunderstood by many listeners, who wrongly assumed that it reflected the performer's personal viewpoint.  Newman would later grow to dislike the song and its success, eventually calling it a ""bad break"", a ""novelty record like The Chipmunks"", and said it caused him to receive several threats regarding its misinterpreted message. However, it ended up being included in almost every one of his greatest hits albums. Although Newman had never charted a single before, and his previous album ""Good Old Boys"" had been his first to reach the Billboard Top 150, ""Short People"" soon gained attention as a novelty song. The song consequently became a major hit on radio, staying at number two on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and being only kept from reaching number one by Player's ""Baby Come Back"" and the Bee Gees's ""Stayin' Alive"". It follows a basic musical formula, with bass and drums centering on Newman's catchy pop piano line in the key of A. A small brass section and an electric guitar occasionally rise into the mix. In 1978, legislation was introduced in the state of Maryland to make it illegal to play ""Short People"" on the radio. Contrary to popular myth, the bill did not obtain enough votes to pass. Appearances in popular culture. The song was performed by actor James Coco on a 1978 episode of ""The Muppet Show"". A ""MADtv"" sketch parodying Newman's songwriting abilities also made references to the song. The Side Street Ramblers performed a version of this song. The song choice highlighted the height difference between the lead and bass singers: 5' and 6'5"" respectively.  In the film ""Semi-Pro"", Will Ferrell sings the song on the bus. It is also featured in the 1994 feature-length adaptation of ""The Little Rascals"", ""The Chipmunks Go to the Movies"" episode ""Funny We Shrunk the Adults"" as performed by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and in the ""Ally McBeal"" episode ""Boy to the World"". This song is heard on a ""Toy Story"" sing-along cassette tape (Newman composed the score to the film). The song is mistakenly mentioned as one of Michael Scott's favorite Bruce Springsteen songs in US version of the ""The Office"" episode ""Crime Aid,"" however, it is comically implied the character of Michael Scott does not realize this is not a Bruce Springsteen song. In 2009, the song was parodied by conservative political satirist Paul Shanklin as ""Old People"" with Shanklin doing a voice impersonation of American President Barack Obama on the health care reform debate in the United States. Andrew Hansen, an Australian satirical comedian, also performed this song on the comedy show Good News Week. Initially in the show he disclaimed the lyrics stating that he didn't hate short people—it was Randy Newman's lyrics (a reference to a skit he earlier participated in that questioned the legitimacy of charities for sick children and caused him, and his group The Chaser, to be temporarily suspended from television). Later in the show he performed the song again with his own lyrics referring to Adolf Hitler, Centrelink and popular television personalities including the show's host Paul McDermott. ""The Cleveland Show"" featured the song in the episode ""A Short Story and a Tall Tale"". The song was used in a good-humored, self-referential manner by Thomas Quasthoff, the great classical and jazz singer marked with heavy birth defects. The song appears in an episode of The Simpsons in its 22nd season. A sample of this song also appears on the diss track ""Say My Name"" featuring Eminem and Xzibit referring to Jermaine Dupree. "
wikipedia-3938438," EL84  The EL84 is a thermionic valve of the power pentode type. It has a 9 pin Noval base and is used mainly in the power output stages of audio amplification circuits, most commonly now in guitar amplifiers, but originally in radios and many other devices of the pre-transistor era. The EL84 is comparable electrically to the octal 6V6, widely used in the USA until the 1960s. An interchangeable North American type is the ""6BQ5"".  It was developed to eliminate the need for a driver tube in radios, and has rather more gain than is usual in a power pentode, producing full output from a relatively small drive signal. This eliminated the need for a preamplifier triode in radios, making them cheaper to produce. As the EL84 itself is a 9 pin Noval, it was also cheap to produce and manufacturers were quick to adopt it in general use, and they are found in many old European valve radios and other audio equipment. A single EL84 was used in low-cost equipment, and a push-pull pair for lower distortion and higher power. In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the Mullard-Philips tube designation, it has a heater voltage of 6.3V. It is capable, when used at its plate rating of 300 volts maximum, of producing 17 watts output in Class AB1 in push-pull configuration. Many guitar amplifiers routinely run EL84 tubes in excess of 400VDC, with the Traynor Guitarmate reportedly putting out 25w RMS with 2 EL84's in a push pull configuration and a B+ between 400-420VDC. Developed by Philips in 1953 for use in the British Mullard 5-10 amplifier, the EL84 came to prominence when used in Watkins (and later the Vox) amplifiers preferred by many British invasion bands of the 1960s. When overdriven, the EL84 power tubes in these amplifiers produce a distinctive chiming, articulate, treble-heavy sound when compared to 6L6 tubes more commonly used in American amplifiers of the era such as those from Fender. Other equivalent tubes are the 7189, an extended-ratings version of the tube for industrial applications, E84L (7320) long life, professional version with more than 10000 hours expected lifetime and the directly equivalent 6P14P (Cyrillic: 6П14П) produced in the USSR by the Reflektor plant. a slightly modified version of the 6P14P was manufactured in Russia for Sovtek. An extended-ratings version of the 6P14P is also available - 6P14P-EV (Cyrillic: 6П14П-ЕВ) and is known among US guitar players as ""EL84M"" or the ""Russian military EL84"".

wikipedia-3938470," History of public international law  The history of public international law examines the evolution and development of public international law in both state practice and conceptual understanding. Modern international law developed out of Renaissance Europe and is strongly entwined with the development of western political organisation at that time. The development of European notions of sovereignty and nation states would necessitate the development of methods for interstate relations and standards of behaviour, and these would lay the foundations of what would become international law. However, while the origins of the modern system of international law can be traced back 400 years, the development of the concepts and practises that would underpin that system can be traced back to ancient historical politics and relationships thousands of years old. Important concepts are derived from the practice between Greek city-states and the Roman law concept of ius gentium (which regulated contacts between Roman citizens and non-Roman people). These principles were not universal however. In East Asia, political theory was based not on the equality of states, but rather the cosmological supremacy of the Emperor of China. Early history. Basic concepts of international law such as treaties can be traced back thousands of years. Early examples of treaties include around 2100BC an agreement between the rulers of the city-states of Lagash and Umma in Mesopotamia, inscribed on a stone block, setting a proscribed boundary between their two states. Around 1000BC, an agreement was signed between Ramses II of Egypt and the king of the Hittites establishing ""eternal peace and brotherhood"" between their two nations: dealing with respect for each other’s territory and establishing a form of defensive alliance. The ancient Greeks before Alexander the Great formed many small states that constantly interacted. In peace and in war, an inter-state culture evolved that prescribed certain rules for how these states would interact. These rules did not apply to interactions with non-Greek states, but among themselves the Greek inter-state community resembled in some respects the modern international community. The Roman Empire did not develop an international law, as it acted without regard to any external rules in its dealings with those territories that were not already part of the empire. The Romans did, however, form municipal laws governing the interactions between private Roman citizens and foreigners. These laws, called the ""jus gentium"" (as opposed to the ""jus civile"" governing interactions between citizens) codified some ideas of basic fairness, and attributed some rules to an objective, independent ""natural law."" These ""jus gentium"" ideas of fairness and natural law have survived and are reflected in modern international law. Nation-states. After the fall of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire into independent cities, principalities, kingdoms and nations, for the first time there was a real need for rules of conduct between a large international community. Without an empire or a dominant religious leadership to moderate and direct international dealings, most of Europe looked to Justinian's code of law from the Roman Empire, and the canon law of the Catholic Church for inspiration. International trade was the real catalyst for the development of objective rules of behavior between states. Without a code of conduct, there was little to guarantee trade or protect the merchants of one state from the actions of another. Economic self-interest drove the evolution of common international trade rules, and most importantly the rules and customs of maritime law. As international trade, exploration and warfare became more involved and complex, the need for common international customs and practices became even more important. The Hanseatic League of the more than 150 entities in what is now Germany developed many useful international customs, which facilitated trade and communication among other things. The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals. Treaties—agreements between governments intended to be binding—became a useful tool to protect commerce. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War, meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities. Hugo Grotius. International practices, customs, rules and treaties proliferated to the point of complexity. Several scholars sought to compile them all into organized treatises. The most important of these was Hugo Grotius, whose treatise ""De Jure Belli Ac Pacis Libri Tres"" is considered the starting point for modern international law. Before Hugo Grotius, most European thinkers treated law as something independent of mankind, with its own existence. Some laws were invented by men, but ultimately they reflected the essential natural law. Grotius was no different, except in one important respect: Unlike the earlier thinkers, who believed that the natural law was imposed by a deity, Grotius believed that the natural law came from an essential universal reason, common to all men. This rationalist perspective enabled Grotius to posit several rational principles underlying law. Law was not imposed from above, but rather derived from principles. Foundation principles included the axioms that promises must be kept, and that harming another requires restitution. These two principles have served as the basis for much of subsequent international law. Apart from natural-law principles, Grotius also dealt with international custom, or voluntary law. Grotius emphasized the importance of actual practices, customs and treaties—what ""is"" done—as opposed to normative rules of what ""ought to be"" done. This positivist approach to international law strengthened over time. As nations became the predominant form of state in Europe, and their man-made laws became more important than religious doctrines and philosophies, the law of what ""is"" similarly became more important than the law of what ""ought to be."" Treaty of Westphalia. The Westphalian treaties of 1648 were a turning point in establishing the principle of state sovereignty as a cornerstone of the international order. However the first attempts at formulating autonomous theories of international law occurred before this, in Spain, in the 16th century. Most prominent among the early theorizers were the Roman Catholic theologians Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Suárez. Suárez is especially notable in this regard in that he distinguished between ius inter gentes and ius intra gentes which he derived from ius gentium (the rights of peoples). Ius inter gentes corresponds to modern international law. In 1625, Hugo Grotius followed with the first systematic treatise on international law, ""de iure belli ac pacis"", which dealt with the laws of war and peace. One important aspect of Grotius's treatment of international law is that he no longer bases it exclusively upon natural law, but also accepts that states among themselves can also create binding rules of law (ius voluntarium).  Still, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea of natural law as a basis for international law remained influential, and were further expressed in the works of Samuel von Pufendorf and Christian Wolff. Yet, in the second half of the 18th century, a shift occurs towards positivism in international law. In addition, the idea of international law as a means for maintaining international peace is challenged due to the increasing tensions between the European great powers (France, Prussia, Great-Britain, Russia and Austria). This tension between legal norms and political imperatives is well reflected in the century's most important treatise on international law, Emer de Vattel's ""Du Droit des Gens"" (1758). At the end of the century, Immanuel Kant believes that international law as a law that can justify war does not serve the purpose of peace anymore, and therefore argues in ""Perpetual Peace"" (""Zum Ewigen Frieden"", 1795) and the ""Metaphysics of Morals"" (""Metaphysik der Sitten"", 1797) for creating a new kind of international law.  After World War I, an attempt was made to establish such a new international law of peace, of which the League of Nations was considered to be one of the cornerstones, but this attempt failed unfortunately. The Charter of the United Nations (1945) in fact reflects the fact that the traditional notion of state sovereignty remains the key concept in the law of nations.  In the historiography of international law, some German authors, most notably among them Wilhelm Grewe and Karl-Heinz Ziegler, have argued that several periods can be distinguished, such as the Spanish era (1494–1648), the French era (1648-1789/1815), the English era (1789/1815-1919) and the American era since 1919. The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645–48), the treaties of Ryswick and Utrecht (1697/1714), Vienna (1814–15), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945). The League of Nations. Following World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions. The League of Nations, established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used ""external aggression"" to invade or conquer other member states. An international court was established, the Permanent Court of International Justice, to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war. Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences. International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs. Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it. The postwar era. After World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re-attempted through another treaty organization, the United Nations. The postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law. International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal. Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter. Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war. International law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war. Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like. Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned. The rules are rarely disputed. But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated. This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights. Modern customary international law. An important development in modern international law is the concept of ""consent."" Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule. Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty. An evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law. Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the ""opinio juris"" of what states believe international law requires them to do. Customary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it. At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions. As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them. When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it. Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting. Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage. Customary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty. For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations. Modern treaty law. Treaties are essentially contracts between countries. They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound. If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept. So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously. Modern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties. The first step is signing the treaty. Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement. The second step is ratifying the treaty. A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it. This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion. A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it. Each country ratifies treaties its own way. The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree. In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound. Modern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it. The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith. This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking. It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding ""preamble."" In the modern world, international law is more important than ever. Even the most powerful countries rely on it, and seek to comply with it—and suffer consequences if they ignore it. "

wikipedia-3938542," A Date with Elvis  A Date with Elvis is the eighth album by Elvis Presley, issued on RCA Victor Records (LPM 2011) in July 1959. It is a compilation of previously unreleased material from an August 1956 recording session at 20th Century Fox Stage One, two from Radio Recorders in Hollywood, and multiple sessions at Sun Studio. The album reached #32 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. It is currently out of print. Content. After Presley's induction into the army on March 24, 1958, RCA and his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, were faced with the prospect of keeping his name before the public for two years with no possibility of live performances, no movies, and with few unissued marketable recordings in the vault. A recording session was arranged for two days in June, which yielded enough items for five more single sides, singles being the commercial focus for rock and roll in the 1950s. Four of those tracks would be issued on 45s in 1958 and 1959 during his absence while doing military service. Presley, however, also did well in the albums market, all but one of his previous seven LPs charting no lower than #3, and RCA wished to continue promoting albums by Presley given his sales record. Much of Presley's material had not been released on LP, and for this album RCA collected material previously unavailable on album. Like its predecessor ""For LP Fans Only"", this album featured tracks that had been issued on Sun Records with limited release, and were almost impossible to locate beyond certain parts of the south. The remaining five tracks derived from three different EPs issued in 1956 and 1957. Even by the standards of the late 1950s and early 1960s, where long-playing albums often ran to only about 35 minutes, this was a very short album at twenty-three minutes, and as such became the lowest charting Presley LP of the decade. RCA would squeeze one more album in 1959 out of previously issued material, the second singles collection, but it too would be a lower seller by previous standard. Presley would return from overseas in 1960 to commence proper recording again. this album also folds out to be a calendar for the year 1960. A different version of the album, duplicating six tracks from the American release, but expanding the track list to a healthy fourteen, was issued in Australia on vinyl in September 1959. RCA issued the original 10 track album on compact disc in 1989. Audiophile CD recordings are available on import in the United States, including the version from Japan in 2005. "

wikipedia-3938749," Aeroflot Flight 593  Aeroflot Flight 593 was a Moscow–Hong Kong passenger service operated by ""AeroflotRussian International Airlines"" flown with an Airbus A310-300 that crashed into a hillside of the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, on 23 March 1994. There were no survivors. No evidence of technical malfunction was found. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders revealed the presence of the pilot's daughter and son on the flight deck. The children apparently had unknowingly disabled the A310 autopilot's control of the aircraft's ailerons while seated at the controls. The aircraft had then rolled into a steep bank and near-vertical dive from which the pilots were unable to regain control. Unlike Soviet planes, with which the crew had been familiar, no audible alarm accompanied the autopilot's partial disconnection, and consequently the crew remained unaware of what was happening. Aircraft. The aircraft involved in the accident was a leased Airbus A310-304, registration , msn 596, that was delivered new to Aeroflot on 11 December 1992. Powered with two General Electric CF6-80C2A2 engines, the airframe had its maiden flight as on 11 September 1991, and was one of five operating for ""Russian Airlines"", an autonomous division of ""AeroflotRussian International Airlines"" that was set up for serving routes to the Russian Far East and Southeast Asia. On average, the crew of three operating the aircraft had logged 900 hours on the type. Description of the accident. The jet was en route from Sheremetyevo International Airport to Hong Kong Kai Tak International Airport with 75 occupants aboard, of whom 63 were passengers. Most of the passengers were businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan who were looking for economic opportunities in Russia. The relief pilot, Yaroslav Kudrinsky (), was taking his two children on their first international flight, and they were brought to the cockpit while he was on duty. Aeroflot allowed families of pilots to travel at a discounted rate once per year. Five people were in the cockpit: Kudrinsky, copilot Igor Peskaryov, Kudrinsky's son Eldar (), his daughter Yana, and another co-pilot that the official investigation report identified as V. E. Makarov. With the autopilot active, Kudrinsky, against regulations, let them sit at the controls. First his daughter Yana took the pilot's left front seat. Kudrinsky adjusted the autopilot's heading to give her the impression that she was turning the plane, though she actually had no control of the aircraft. Shortly thereafter Eldar occupied the pilot's seat. Unlike his sister, Eldar applied enough force to the control column to contradict the autopilot for 30 seconds. This caused the flight computer to switch the plane's ailerons to manual control while maintaining control over the other flight systems. A silent indicator light came on to alert the pilots to this partial disengagement. However, the pilots, who had previously flown Russian-designed planes which had audible warning signals, apparently failed to notice it. The first to notice a problem was Eldar, who observed that the plane was banking right. Shortly after, the flight path indicator changed to show the new flight path of the aircraft as it turned. Since the turn was continuous, the resulting predicted flight path drawn on screen was a 180 degree turn. This indication is similar to the indications shown when in a holding pattern, where a 180 degree turn is intentional to remain in one place. This confused the pilots for nine seconds. During this confusion, the plane banked past a 45-degree angle (steeper than it was designed for). This increased the g-force on the pilots and crew, making it impossible for them to regain control. After the plane banked to 90 degrees, the remaining functions of the autopilot tried to correct its plummeting altitude by putting the plane in an almost vertical ascent, nearly stalling the plane. The co-pilot and Eldar managed to get the plane into a nosedive, which reduced the g-forces and enabled the captain to take the controls. Though he and his co-pilot did regain control and level out the wings, their altitude by then was too low to recover, and the plane crashed at high vertical speed, estimated at . All aboard were killed.  The aircraft crashed gear up, and all passengers had been prepared for an emergency, as they were strapped into their seats. No distress calls were made prior to the crash. Despite the struggles of both pilots to save the aircraft, it was later concluded that if they had just let go of the control column, the autopilot would have automatically taken action to prevent stalling, thus avoiding the accident. The wreckage was located on a remote hillside approximately east of Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia; the flight data recorders were found on the second day of searching. Families of western victims placed flowers on the crash site, while families of Chinese victims scattered pieces of paper with messages written on them around the crash site. The airline originally denied that children were in the cockpit. The Moscow-based magazine ""Obozrevatel"" (Обозреватель ""Observer"") published the transcript on the week of Wednesday, 28 September 1994. The ""Associated Press"" said that, according to the transcript, ""the Russian crew almost succeeded in saving the plane"". ""The New York Times"" said that ""A transcript of the tape printed in the magazine Obozrevatel shows that the Russian crew nearly managed to save the Airbus plane and the 75 people on board, but that it was hampered by the presence of children and its unfamiliarity with the foreign-made plane.""

wikipedia-3938775," Push–pull converter  A push–pull converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter that uses a transformer to change the voltage of a DC power supply. The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push–pull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications. Circuit operation. The term ""push–pull"" is sometimes used to generally refer to any converter with bidirectional excitation of the transformer. For example, in a full-bridge converter, the switches (connected as an H-bridge) alternate the voltage across the supply side of the transformer, causing the transformer to function as it would for AC power and produce a voltage on its output side.  However, ""push–pull"" more commonly refers to a two-switch topology with a split primary winding. In any case, the output is then rectified and sent to the load. Capacitors are often included at the output to buffer against the inevitable switching noise. In practice, it is necessary to allow a small interval between powering the transformer one way and powering it the other: the “switches” are usually pairs of transistors (or similar devices), and were the two transistors in the pair to switch simultaneously there would be a risk of shorting out the power supply. Hence, a small wait is needed to avoid this problem. This wait time is called ""Dead Time"" and is necessary to avoid transistor shoot-through. Transistors. N-type and P-type power transistors can be used. Power MOSFETs are often chosen for this role due to their high current switching capability and their inherently low ON resistance. The gates or bases of the power transistors are tied via a resistor to one of the supply voltages. A P-type transistor is used to pull up the N-type power transistor gate (common source) and an N-type transistor is used to pull down the P-type power transistor gate. Alternatively, all power transistors can be N-type, which offer around three times the gain of their P-type equivalents. In this alternative the N-type transistor used in place of the P-type has to be driven in this way: The voltage is amplified by one P-type transistor and one N-type transistor in common base configuration to rail-to-rail amplitude. Then the power transistor is driven in common drain configuration to amplify the current. In high frequency applications both transistors are driven with common source. The operation of the circuit means that both transistors are actually pushing, and the pulling is done by a low pass filter (coil) in general, and by a center tap of the transformer in the converter application. But because the transistors push in an alternating fashion, the device is called a push-pull converter. Timing. If both transistors are in their on state, a short circuit results. On the other hand if both transistors are in their off state, high voltage peaks appear due to back EMF. If the driver for the transistors is powerful and fast enough, the back EMF has no time to charge the capacity of the windings and of the body-diode of the MOSFETs to high voltages. If a microcontroller is used, it can be used to measure the peak voltage and digitally adjust the timing for the transistors, so that the peak only just appears. This is especially useful when the transistors are starting from cold with no peaks, and are in their boot phase. The cycle starts with no voltage and no current. Then one transistor turns on, a constant voltage is applied to the primary, current increases linearly, and a constant voltage is induced in the secondary. After some time T the transistor is turned off, the parasitic capacities of the transistors and the transformer and the inductance of the transformer form an LC circuit which swings to the opposite polarity. Then the other transistor turns on. For the same time T charge flows back into the storage capacitor, then changes the direction automatically, and for another time T the charge flows in the transformer. Then again the first transistor turns on until the current is stopped. Then the cycle is finished, another cycle can start anytime later. The S-shaped current is needed to improve over the simpler converters and deal efficiently with remanence. "

A right-handed batsman and a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he plays first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Patel made his One Day International debut for England in August 2008, however was later dropped from the side after failing to meet fitness levels. After an absence of 2 and a half years, he returned to the ODI side in 2011 and made his Twenty20 International debut, before becoming the 651st player to represent England at Test cricket by winning his first cap on the tour of Sri Lanka. Early and personal life. Samit Patel was born in Leicester on 30 November 1984, to Rohit and Sejal. His parents originated in India where he has relatives. Patel's brother Akhil (b. 1990) has also played for Nottinghamshire, making his debut in 2009. Patel was educated at Eastwood Comprehensive School but later studied at Worksop College in north Nottinghamshire where he was a member of the 1st XI cricket team for five seasons. Whilst at the College, Patel represented England at under 15, under-17 and under-19 levels. He helped them record wins over such schools as Repton, Manchester Grammar School and Shrewsbury School and such clubs as the MCC. Career. Since making his début for Nottinghamshire at the age of 16, Patel has featured consistently in the team, in both first class and List A matches. He became the only man in the history of the English Twenty20 competition to claim a double-wicket-maiden, when Nottinghamshire played Derbyshire at New Road, Worcester in 2006. He scored 887 runs in the County Championship in 2007 including four centuries – he also took 10 wickets and topped the county's bowling averages. In the 2008 season, Patel made a steady start to Nottinghamshire's first-class campaign, scoring a century against Durham and three half-centuries. International breakthrough. Patel made his debut for England's senior one-day team in a match against Scotland on 18 August 2008. His first wicket was that of Neil McCallum and he finished with figures of 1/22 from seven overs; he also took a catch and ran out the Scotland captain, Ryan Watson. Patel remained part of England's ODI team for the series against South Africa later that summer, taking the notable wicket of Herschelle Gibbs in the first ODI of the series at Headingley. He recorded figures of 5/41 and scored 31 runs off 49 balls in the third ODI to win the man of the match award as England claimed the series. In September 2008, it was announced that Patel and six other players – the group was mostly made up of ODI specialists – would be given incremental contracts with the England Cricket Board (ECB). Having been previously included in England's ODI and T20 squads for the tour of the West Indies in March and April 2009, Patel was dropped over fitness concerns. Hugh Morris, the director of English cricket, stated that ""Samit Patel is a talented cricketer but he, like every other player who joins the senior England team, must be aware of the strict fitness criteria that will be set. It is extremely frustrating that Samit has not heeded the warnings of his county, Nottinghamshire, and Geoff Miller selector as well as the England management and strength and conditioning team. In the circumstances we had no option but to de select him from the tour ... his fitness levels have regressed between his first assessment during the build up to the England Lions tour and the second Test during the first week in New Zealand."" Despite the setback, in April 2009 Patel was selected for England's 25-man performance squad. Having worked to improve his fitness, Patel said ""I have had to accept some difficult truths ... I don't want to be in a position again where I miss out on selection because of a lack of fitness"". Initially included in the 30-man preliminary squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Patel failed to make the final 15-man squad because of ongoing fitness problems. Geoff Miller commented ""I'm disappointed for us and for him, but we've laid down the rules and players have to abide by them. He feels he's been putting the work and time in, but he cannot explain it – the figures are there"". Nottinghamshire were runners-up to Durham in the 2009 County Championship; from 15 matches Patel scored 712 runs (the 4th most for the club that year) at an average of 30.95, with a highest score of 95. He also took 32 wickets at an average of 47.84, with two five wicket hauls. In January 2010, Patel signed a three-year deal with Nottinghamshire. He part funded a journey to the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy in Australia where he spent February and March, part of which was aimed at improving his fitness. When Nottinghamshire won the County Championship in 2010, Patel contributed fewer runs: 641 from 16 matches at an average of 26.70, making him the club's 6th highest run-scorer in the year's competition. His solitary century in the competition, an innings of 104 from 185 balls, came in a defeat to Somerset in July. On England's fringes. In September 2009, a year after he was granted an incremental contract with the ECB, Patel's England contract was not renewed for 2009–2010. He remained on the fringes of selection, however his level of fitness prevented his selection. In January 2010, Miller stated that ""He knows what is required ... the ball is in his court now and he has to go away and understand what is necessary"". When England's provisional 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup was announced in December that year, Patel was included. England coach Andy Flower had commented that Patel's style of play would be well suited to the pitches in the Indian subcontinent, which was hosting the tournament, however persistent fitness problems meant he was not selected in the final squad of 15 and not called up when the squad sustained injuries. Patel was recalled to the England squad in June 2011 to face Sri Lanka in a T20I and five ODIs. Miller explained that Patel had been selected due to ""excellent form and plenty of hard work"". He made his Twenty20 International debut on 25 June against Sri Lanka; Patel was run out without scoring and bowled two wicketless overs as England succumbed to a nine-wicket defeat. For the fifth and final match of the ODI series, Patel returned to play his first ODI since November 2008. He scored eight runs and took 1/49. When England beat India 5–0 in the September ODI series, Patel played three matches. He took a solitary wicket and scored nine runs from a single innings. In October, England toured India for five ODIs and a T20I. Though England lost the series 5–0, Patel scored 160 runs and took four wickets at an average of 45.50. During the third ODI Patel scored his maiden half-century, 70 from 43 balls, beating his previous highest score in the format of 42. Patel had been in the preliminary list for the player auction ahead of the 2012 Indian Premier League but opted to withdraw to concentrate on English domestic cricket as participating would have meant missing up to seven County Championship matches. The new year began with Patel's inclusion in the England Lions squad to tour Sri Lanka in late January and early February 2012 for a one-day series. Patel played in all five matches and scored 128 runs with a highest score of 50, and was the leading wicket-taker on either side in the series with 12 wickets. When the ODI squad to face Pakistan was announced in February Patel was included. During the series, which England won 4–0, Patel was given an incremental contract by the ECB. England had suffered a 3–0 defeats in the Tests against Pakistan and when they toured Sri Lanka in March, struggling batsman Eoin Morgan was dropped and Patel was selected in the Test squad for the first time. Patel played in both Tests against Sri Lanka, batting at number 7 each time and making scores of 2, 9, and 29 and was dismissed each time by a spin bowler. He bowled 59 overs, taking 3/122. Patel began the English season in April with a run of low scores, amassing 33 runs from his first four innings. "
wikipedia-3939022," Wild World  ""Wild World"" is a song written and recorded by English singer-songwriter Cat Stevens. It first appeared on his fourth album, ""Tea for the Tillerman"", recorded and released in 1970 and, continuing the change in Stevens' sound, after leaving Deram Records and signing with Island Records. ""Mona Bone Jakon"" was his first album released after a debilitating year of recovery from tuberculosis. As he convalesced, Stevens filled his time whilst still on bedrest, finding himself becoming a far more prolific songwriter, and after such a dramatic brush with death began to focus on his purpose in life after some unpleasant and stressful dealings with his previous record label. Favouring a newfound ""stripped down"" folk rock sound and bucking the heavily orchestrated constraints from his previous contract with Deram Records' Mike Hurst, he instead chose Paul Samwell-Smith (formerly of The Yardbirds) as his producer. With Samwell-Smith supportive of his judgement, Stevens once again began turning out hit records with a different meaning and depth, both lyrically and melodically, beginning with ""Mona Bone Jakon"" and continuing to ""Tea for the Tillerman"", where ""Wild World"" became a popular hit song both in the United Kingdom and the United States. Both critics and Stevens himself agree that this album and the songs to come from it are some of Stevens' best work. Song meaning. Stevens developed a relationship with a young American woman, Patti D'Arbanville, and the two were a pair throughout a period of two years or so. During that time, he wrote several songs about her, including the hit song ""Wild World.""  The song is in the form of the singer's words to his departing lover, inspired by the end of their romance. Stevens later recalled to ""Mojo"": ""It was one of those chord sequences that's very common in Spanish music. I turned it around and came up with that theme- which is a recurring theme in my work- which is to do with leaving, the sadness of leaving, and the anticipation of what lies beyond."" Released as a single in late 1970, it just missed becoming Stevens' first top ten hit in the U.S., peaking at #11 on the ""Billboard Pop Singles"" chart. ""Wild World"" has been credited as the song that gave Stevens next album, ""Tea for the Tillerman"" ""enough kick"" to get it played on FM radio; and Island Records' Chris Blackwell has been quoted as calling it ""the best album we’ve ever released"" to that date. In November 2008, the Tea for the Tillerman CD was re-issued in a deluxe version which included the original demo of Wild World. Cover versions. The song has been covered by many artists, with many of the covers becoming hits of their own. Jimmy Cliff's version, released a few months after Stevens released the original version, reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. Surprisingly, Stevens' version was not released as a single in the UK. Some of the subsequent covers have also been in the reggae style, indicating that they may be covers of Cliff's version, as opposed to direct covers of Cat Stevens' original arrangement. An example of this would be Maxi Priest's version of the song. Recorded and released as a single in 1988, this version also did well on the charts, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart and #25 on the US Billboard Pop Singles Chart. In 1993, the band Mr. Big released a cover of the song as a single, charting at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100, #33 on the Top 40 Mainstream #33 and #12 on the Mainstream Top 40. In 1970, Australian band Fourth House released a cover version of ""Wild World"" as their one and only single. It reached #16 on the Australian charts. In 1971 Barry Manilow recorded Could It Be Magic, which features the same refrain melodically and lyrically (""Baby, I love you"").  In 1987, Jonathan King accused Pet Shop Boys of plagiarising the melody of ""Wild World"" for their UK #1 single ""It's a Sin"". He made the claims in ""The Sun"", for which he wrote a regular column during the 1980s. King also released his own cover version of ""Wild World"" as a single, using a similar musical arrangement to ""It's a Sin"", in an effort to demonstrate his claims. This single flopped, while Pet Shop Boys sued King, eventually winning out-of-court damages, which they donated to charity. In 2000, Brazilian pop group Pepê & Neném recorded a version of the song in Portuguese, ""Nada me faz esquecer"" (Nothing makes me forget). In 2006, ""Littlest Things,"" the third single released by Lily Allen from her debut album, ""Alright, Still"", was noted as having similarities with Wild World in its introduction. On July 7, 2007, the song was performed twice at the Live Earth concerts. James Blunt sang it at Wembley Stadium in London, England, while Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens) himself sang it in Hamburg, Germany. "

wikipedia-3939498," Rakhine people  The Arakanese (, Rakhine pronunciation ; ; formerly Arakanese), is a nationality in Myanmar forming the majority along the coastal region of present day Rakhine State. They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total population but no accurate census figures exist. Arakanese people also live in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong and Barisal Divisions. A group of Arakanese descendants, living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are known as the Marma people. These Arakanese descendants have been living in that area since the Arakanese kingdom's control of the Chittagong region. Arakanese descendants spread as far north as Tripura state in India, where their presence dates back to the ascent of the Arakanese kingdom when Tripura was ruled by Arakanese kings. In northeast India, these Arakanese people are referred to as the Mog, while in Bengali, the Marma (the ethnic Arakanese descendants in Bangladesh) and other Arakanese people are referred to as the Magh people. Etymology. According to the Rakhine Chronicles, the name ""Rakhine"" or ""Rakhine"" was originated from Pali word ""Rakhapura"" meaning the land of the people of Rakshasa (Rakshasa > Rakha > Rakhine) who were titled this name in honour of preservation on their national heritage (""a myo"") and or morality (""sila""). The word Rakhine means ""one who maintains his own race."" Nevertheless, the Arakanese have over the centuries been called many things by different visitors and their neighbours, including ""Burmese"" during the colonial period. Culture. The Arakanese are predominantly Theravada Buddhists and are one of the four main Buddhist ethnic groups of Myanmar (the others being the Bamar, Shan and Mon). They claim to be one of the first groups to become followers of the Buddha in Southeast Asia. The Arakanese culture is similar to the dominant Burmese culture but with more Indian influence, likely due to its geographical isolation from the Burmese mainland divided by the Rakhine Roma and closer proximity to South Asia. Traces of Indian influence remain in many aspects of Arakanese culture, including its literature, music, and cuisine. Language. The Arakanese language is a divergent form of Burmese. It is still generally mutually intelligible with standard Burmese, however, Arakanese retains the /r/ sound, which is now a /j/ sound in Burmese. Modern Arakanese script, aside from few vocabulary differences, is essentially the same as standard Burmese script. (The northern Brahmi-based Rakhawunna script found in stone inscriptions in the Vesali (Wethali) era is no longer in use.) History. The people of Rakhine claim a history that began in 3325 BC and archaeological evidence has been found for the beginning of the 1st century AD at the excavations at Dhanyawadi. According to the chronicles, the first independent Rakhine kingdom was established in 3325 BC by King Marayu. The name of the kingdom “Dhanyawadi” means ""the land blessed with abundant grain."" Buddhism was introduced into Rakhine during the lifetime of the Buddha himself. According to Rakhine chronicles, Buddha in his lifetime visited the city of Dhanyawadi. In 554 BC, the Rakhine King Sandar Surya (Moon Sun) requested Buddha to leave an image of Himself. After casting the Great Image Mahamuni, (Great Sage) Buddha breathed upon it which resembled the exact likeness of the Blessed One. Dhanyawadi. Ancient Dhanyawadi lies west of the mountain ridge between the Kaladan and Le-mro rivers. Its city walls were made of brick, and form an irregular circle with a perimeter of about 9.6 km, enclosing an area of about 4.42 square km. Beyond the walls, the remains of a wide moat, now silted over and covered by paddy fields, are still visible in places. The remains of brick fortifications can be seen along the hilly ridge which provided protection from the west. Within the city, a similar wall and moat enclose the palace site, which has an area of 0.26 square km, and another wall surrounds the palace itself. From aerial photographs we can discern Dhanyawad I's irrigation channels and storage tanks, centered at the palace site. Mrauk-U. Mrauk-U, the last kingdom of independent Arakan founded by King Mong Saw Mon in 1430, has become the principle seat of Buddhism, has reaching at zenith of the golden age. Mrauk-U was divided into three periods: the earliest period (1430–1530), the middle period (1531–1638), and the last period (1638–1784). In Arakan antiquities at the Mrauk-U seems to give rational evidence as to where Buddhism was settled down. The golden days of Mrauk U city, those of 16th and 17th centuries, were contemporary to the days of Tudor kings, the Moghuls, the Ayuthiya kings and Ava (Inwa), Taungoo and Hanthawaddy kings of Myanmar. Mrauk U was cosmopolitan city, fortified by a 30-kilometer long fortification and an intricate net of moats and canals. At the centre of the city was the Royal Place, looming high over the surrounding area like an Asian Acropolis. Waterways formed by canals and creeks earned the fame of distinct resemblance to Venice. Mrauk U offers some of the richest archaeological sites in South-East Asia. These include stone inscriptions, Buddha images, the Buddha's foot-prints and the great pagoda itself which, stripped its later-constructed top, would be of the same design as the Gupta style of ancient India. In the city of golden Mrauk-U there are scattering innumerable temples and pagodas which preserved as places, thereby exerting a great influence on spiritual life of the people. Historical artifacts. The 243 Rakhine kings ruled Arakan for a long period of 5108 years. The oldest artefact, stone image of Fat Monk inscribed ""Saccakaparibajaka Jina"" in Brahmi inscription comes to the date of first century AD. An ancient stone inscription in Nagari character was discovered by renowned Archaeologist Dr. Forchhammer. Known as Salagiri, this hill was where the great teacher came to Rakhine some two thousand five hundred years ago. Somewhere from eastern part of this hill, a stone image in Dhamma-cakra-mudra now kept in Mrauk-U museum, was found earlier in 1923. This relief sculpture found on the Salagiri Hill represents Buddha preaching King Chandra Suriya belongs to 4th century AD; five more red sandstone slabs with the carving were found close by the south of this Salagiri Hill in 1986. They are the same type as the single slab found earlier in 1923. These carving slabs of Bhumispara-mudra, Kararuna-mudra, Dhammacakra-mudara, and Mmahaparinibbana-mudra represent the life of Buddha. These sculptures provide earliest evident about the advent of Buddhism into Rakhine; during the lifetime of the Buddha and these discoveries were therefore assumed as the figures of King Chandra Suriya of Dyanawadi, who dedicated the Great Maha Muni Image. These archaeological findings have been studied by eminent scholars and conclusion is that the Maha Muni was made during the king Sanda Suriya era. The founder of Vesali city, King Dvan Chandra carved Vesali Paragri Buddha-image in 327 A.D and set a dedicatory inscription in Pali verse That Buddha-image is carved out by a single block and the earliest image of Vesali. The meaning of Ye Dhamma verse is as follow. The verse, which is considered as the essence of Theravada spirit, bears testimony to the fact that Buddhism flourished to an utmost degree in Vesali. The relationship of Vesali with foreign countries especially Ceylon would be established for Buddhism. The stone inscriptions are of Sanskrit, Pali, Rakhine, Pyu languages. Anandachandra Inscriptions date back to 729 AD originally from Vesali now preserved at Shitethaung indicates adequate evidence for the earliest foundation of Buddhism. Dr. E. H. Johnston's analysis reveals a list of kings which he considered reliable beginning from Chandra dynasty. The western face inscription has 72 lines of text recorded in 51 verses describing the Anandachandra's ancestral rulers. Each face recorded the name and ruling period of each king who were believed to have ruled over the land before Anandachandra. Archaeology has shown that the establishment of so many stone pagodas and inscriptions which have been totally neglected for centuries in different part of Rakhine speak of popular favored by Buddhism. The cubic stone inscriptions record the peace making between the governor of Thandaway (Sandoway) Mong Khari (1433–1459) and Razadhiraj the Mon Emperor in Rakhine inscription. This was found from a garrison hill at the oldest site of Parein. A stone slab with the alleged figure of the Buddha preaching, King Chandra Suriya bore testimony to the Salagiri tradition, depicting of the advent of the Teacher to Dyanyawaddy. Convention of the Buddhist Council in Rakhine. The crowing event in the history of Rakhine was the Convention of the Buddhist Council at the top of golden hill of Vesali under the royal patronage of King Dhammawizaya in 638 AD through joint effort of two countries, Rakhine and Ceylon. This momentous triumph of the great council was participated by one thousand monks from Ceylon and one thousand monks from Rakhine kingdom. As a fitting celebration of the occasion, the lavish construction of pagodas, statues and monasteries were undertaken for the purpose of inscribing the Tripitaka. After Vesali, Pyinsa was found by Lemro dynasty in 818 AD; the great king of dynasty (AD 818-1430) was King Mim-Yin-Phru, who turned his attention towards the development of Buddhism, and in 847 AD he convened the second Buddhist council in Rakhine attended by 800 Arahants. Rakhine chronicles report that therein the Tripitaka and Atthakatha were inscribed on the golden plate and enshrined. Never has there been impediment in the practice of Theravada Buddhist faith since it has been introduced in Rakhine. The copious findings of inscription Ye Dhamma verse were practical evidence that Theravada was dominant faith if epigraphic and archaeological sources were to be believed. The Royal patronage has always been significant factor contribution to stability and progress of the religion in Rakhine. Architecture. Arakanese chronicle records that more than six million shrines and pagodas flourished in Mrauk-U. In fact, they formed the pride of golden Mrauk-U. Dr. Forchhammer in his book entitled ""Arakan"", ""in durability, architectural skill, and ornamentation the Mrauk-U temples far surpass those on the banks of Arrawaddy"". Buddhist arts both in the field of architecture and Buddha-image constructions are on the same line of flourishing. An illustrative example of this fact can be seen in the temple of Chitthaung pagoda and colossal Dukekanthein temple. Gold and silver coins serve as the priceless heritage of the Mrauk-U period. The tradition of coin-making was handed down from the Vesali kings who started minting coins around the fifth century. The coins so far found are of one denomination only. Inscribed on the coins are the title of the ruling king and his year of coronation; coins before 1638 had Rakhine inscriptions on one side and Persian and Nagari inscriptions on the other. The inclusion of the foreign inscriptions was meant for the easy acceptance by the neighboring countries and the Arab traders. Twenty-three types of silver coins and three types of gold coins have so far been found. All the kings who ascended the throne issued coins. City walls, gates, settlements, monastery sites, fortresses, garrisons and moats are the other priceless heritages left to the safe keeping of today's Rakhine people. Stone rubbles of proud mansions of that period are also priceless reminders of Rakhine glory. It is no wonder that Mrauk U is properly known as the ""Land of Pagodas"" and Europeans remarked Mrauk U as ""The Golden City"". The Rakhine of those days were proud of Mrauk U. They were entirely satisfied to be the inhabitants of Mrauk U. The history shows what happened in the city in early times. Foreign invasion. The country had been invaded several times, by the Mongols, Mon, Bamar and Portuguese and finally the Bamar in 1784 when the armies led by the Crown Prince, son of King Bodawpaya, of the Konbaung dynasty of Burma marched across the western Yoma and annexed Rakhine. The religious relics of the kingdom were stolen from Rakhine, most notably the Mahamuni Buddha image, and taken into central Burma where they remain today. The people of Rakhine resisted the conquest of the kingdom for decades after. Fighting with the Rakhine resistance, initially led by Nga Than Dè and finally by Chin Byan in border areas, created problems between British India and Burma. The year 1826 saw the defeat of the Bamar in the First Anglo-Burmese War and Rakhine was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Yandabo. Sittwe (Akyab) was then designated the new capital of Rakhine. In 1852, Rakhine was merged into Lower Burma as a territorial division. Independence movement. Rakhine was the center of multiple insurgencies which fought against British rule, notably led by the monks U Ottama and U Seinda. During the Second World War, Rakhine was given autonomy under the Japanese occupation and was even granted its own army known as the Arakan Defense Force. The Arakan Defense Force went over to the allies and turned against the Japanese in early 1945. In 1948, Rakhine became a division within the Union of Burma. Shortly after, violence broke out along religious lines between Buddhists and Muslims. Later there were calls for secession by the Arakanese, but such attempts were subdued. In 1974, the Ne Win government's new constitution granted Rakhine Division ""state"" status but the gesture was largely seen as meaningless since the military junta held all power in the country and in Rakhine. 2012 Rakhine State riots. The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya people and Arakanese in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. The riots came after weeks of sectarian disputes and have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict. The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Rohingyas by Arakanese as the main cause. Whole villages have been ""decimated"". Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Bingali Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June, 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced. According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between Arakanese Buddhists and Rohingyas, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed. It also displaced more than 52,000 Rohingya people. The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the regions. On June 10, state of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region. The Burmese army and police have been accused of targeting Bingali Muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence. A number of monks' organizations that played vital role in Burma's struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Bingali community. In July 2012, the Myanmar Government did not include the Rohingyas–-classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and therefore the government says that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.

In the film, he is a ""Brooklyn-loving"", sports-loving, die-hard New York Knicks fan. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, ""Mars Blackmon"" became the primary pitchman in Nike commercials for ""Air Jordans"", the basketball shoes worn by Michael Jordan. As of January 2011, Nike has resumed using the character for its Air Jordan ""Spiz'ike"" line of shoes. In the April 30, 2010 episode of the genealogy television show ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" that focused on Spike Lee's search for his mother's ancestors, Spike said that he had called his grandmother to ask for a name for the character. His grandmother had given him the name ""Mars"". In the episode, Spike's research finds that Mars was the name of his great-great-grandfather (his grandmother's grandfather). "
wikipedia-3939538," Doctor of Nursing Practice  The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) is a terminal professional degree that focuses on the clinical aspects of a disease process. The curriculum for the DNP degree generally includes advanced practice, diagnoses, and treatment of diseases. The DNP is intended to prepare a registered nurse to become an independent primary care provider. Furthermore, the DNP is intended to be a parity degree with other health care doctorates such as psychology, medicine, and dentistry. Primary practice roles in nursing include the nurse practitioner (NP), certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), certified nurse midwife (CNM), and the clinical nurse specialist (CNS). Although approximately 52% of nurse anesthetist programs will award the DNP, the remaining 48% may use the title Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP) for their terminal degree. Education requirements in the United States. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), transitioning advance practice registered nursing programs from the graduate level to the doctoral level is a ""...response to changes in health care delivery and emerging health care needs, additional knowledge or content areas have been identified by practicing nurses. In addition, the knowledge required to provide leadership in the discipline of nursing is so complex and rapidly changing that additional or doctoral level education is needed."" According to the AACN, ""...benefits of practice-focused doctoral programs include: Transitioning toward the doctorate. The AACN recommends that all entry-level nurse practitioner educational programs be transitioned from the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree to the DNP degree by the year 2015. The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists has followed suit, requiring the DNP (or DNAP-Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice) degree for entry-level nurse anesthetist programs by the year 2025. Nurse practitioners and nurse anesthetists currently practicing with either an MSN or certificate will not be required to obtain the DNP for continued practice. There are two terminal doctorate-level degrees in nursing: The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Previous doctorate level degrees have been, or are in the process of being, phased out and converted to one of the two terminal degrees. The Doctor of Nursing (ND, not to be confused with Naturopathic Doctor ""ND"") and the (DrNP) have transitioned into the DNP whereas the Doctor of Nursing Science (DNSc, DNS or DSN) has transitioned into the PhD. The PhD in nursing is generally considered the academic and research-oriented degree, whereas the DNP is the practice-oriented or professional terminal degree. Controversy in the United States. DNP and the use of the ""Doctor"" title. Currently there is a controversy over the title “Doctor” being used within the clinical setting by the DNP. Although MDs, DOs, and DNPs all nominally hold a doctorate degree by education, in a medical setting the term ""doctor"" has historically referred to Doctors of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), Podiatrists (DPM), Dentists (DDS or DMD), and Optometrists (OD) but not to Nurse Practitioners (NP) since they generally did not hold doctorate degrees. However, the DNP has evolved much like the other clinical doctorates, and, some argue, that the public uses the term ""doctor"" generically to describe that person who is a licensed professional and is in the primary decision making role for their care. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing and six other professional nursing organizations contend that the term ""doctor"" is an appropriate term to describe a Doctor of Nursing Practice. However, a 2008 survey revealed considerable confusion among Americans regarding the credentials and qualifications of many healthcare providers, and that an overwhelming majority favor all healthcare providers to clearly designate their skills, training, and level of education. These findings prompted the American Medical Association to launch the ""Truth in Advertising Campaign"" in 2011 to promote transparency in how all healthcare providers market themselves, stating, ""Patients deserve to know who is providing their care."" They further contend that ""Confusion among Americans about who is and who is not qualified to provide specific patient care undermines the reliability of the healthcare system and can put patients at risk."".  As of 2013, only a few states specifically prohibit DNP's from using the title ""Doctor"" with their patients (Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon), while four more states require them to clarify that they are not physicians (New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Virginia). Masters vs Doctorate. Although controversial, the adequacy of existing master's-level education is further supported by other articles that show that in resource poor areas with Medicaid clientele, nurse practitioners provide a level of care that is rated similar to that of physicians in comparable level. It is however, unclear whether patient rating of care correlates with equal outcomes. In contrast, the level of training between physicians board certified in an area of specialty and a DNP working as a primary care provider is not intended to be comparable. A physician will typically have 4 years of undergraduate education, 4 years of medical school, and 3 to 8 years in paid residency (e.g. family practice, internal medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, etc.). Physicians often continue by doing a subspecialty or fellowship (e.g. cardiology, nephrology, oncology, etc.). In contrast a typical DNP will have 4 years of undergraduate education, experience as a registered nurse, and 4 years of advanced practice education (e.g. women's health, pediatrics, anesthesia, etc.). Additionally, the prolonged education of physicians through specialty residencies has compounded primary care shortages in the United States and therefore the DNP offers a practical solution with its primary care emphasis and streamlined clinical focus. Nurse practitioner vs Physician Assistant. There is much controversy between the DNP and the Physician assistant, in that each have a similar scope of practice. The DNP in general has more autonomy as a health care provider. The greater autonomy for the DNP largely comes from education requirements and the governing bodies that influence each professions scope of practice. The PA scope of practice is largely determined by the American Medical Association, individual State, and physician delegation. While the DNP scope of practice is determined by the individual State Board of Nursing. However, the DNP has a licensing exam which is determined by the practicing state (commonly administered by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners). PA programs have transitioned to a master's level with an average length of 27 months. The nurse practitioner may complete a bachelors degree in nursing, practice as a nurse for at least one year, and then either completes the master's level NP in 2 years or the DNP in 3 years. However having a bachelors degree in nursing and practicing as a nurse before entry into the program are not required to become an NP; not all NPs have previous nursing experience. The requirements vary widely depending on the NP program. Overall, the scope of practice of a DNP and a PA vary from state to state and depend ""entirely"" on the law of the practitioner's state. Nurse practitioner vs physician. In the United States, patient choice between physicians and nurse practitioners has become a point of contention, especially as nurse practitioners gain greater autonomy. "

wikipedia-3939583," Kirk Bloodsworth  Kirk Noble Bloodsworth (born October 31, 1960) is the first American sentenced to death row who was exonerated by DNA, although his death sentence had already been commuted to two consecutive life sentences by the time his exoneration based upon DNA evidence was in the works.  Imprisonment. An honorably discharged former Marine and Maryland resident, Bloodsworth was convicted in 1985 of sexual assault, rape, and first-degree premeditated murder for the 1984 rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in Rosedale, Maryland. Even though five eyewitnesses had placed him with the victim, he continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent incarceration. In 1992, while in jail, Bloodsworth read an account of how DNA fingerprinting had led to the conviction of Colin Pitchfork in the killings of Dawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann; hoping to prove his innocence, he pushed to have the evidence against him tested by the then-novel method. Initially, the available evidence in the case — traces of semen in the victim's underwear — was thought to have been destroyed; however, when eventually located (in a paper bag in the judge's chambers), testing proved that the semen did not match Bloodsworth's DNA profile. In 1993, Bloodsworth was released; by that time, he had spent almost nine years in prison, two of them on death row. Though released from prison, Bloodsworth was not formally exonerated. In 2003, nearly a decade after Bloodsworth's release, prisoner DNA evidence added to state and federal databases identified the real killer, Kimberly Shay Ruffner. A month after the 1984 murder, Ruffner had been sentenced to 45 years for an unrelated burglary, attempted rape and assault with intent to murder, and had in fact been incarcerated in a cell one floor below Bloodsworth's own cell. In light of the new evidence, Ruffner was charged with the crime for which Bloodsworth had been wrongfully convicted, and in 2004 Ruffner pled guilty to the 1984 murder.  Life After Prison. While in prison, Bloodsworth converted to the Catholic Church from Protestantism. Today, Bloodsworth is a Program Officer for The Justice Project, and he has been an ardent supporter of the Innocence Protection Act (IPA) since its introduction in Congress in February 2000. The IPA established the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program, a program that will help states defray the costs of post-conviction DNA testing. Further reading.

wikipedia-3940091," HP-10C series  The HP-10C series calculators were introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1981. Also known as the ""Voyager"" series, all are programmable, use Reverse Polish Notation, and feature continuous memory. Nearly identical in appearance, each model provided different capabilities and was aimed at different user markets. The HP calculators 10C series consisted of five models (with original retail price and years of production): The HP-12C remains in widespread use today. HP-10C. The HP-10C is the last and lowest-featured calculator in this line, even though its number would suggest an earlier origin. The 10C was a basic scientific programmable. While a useful general purpose RPN calculator, the HP-11C offered twice as much for only a slight increase in price. Designed to be an introductory calculator, it was still costly compared to the competition, and many looking at an HP would just step up to the better HP-11C. Poor sales led to a very short market life making it one of the most difficult of the series to find today. HP-11C. The HP-11C is a mid-range scientific programmable calculator. HP-12C. The HP-12C is a popular financial calculator. It was such a successful model that Hewlett-Packard redesigned it from scratch, added several new functions, and introduced it as the HP-12C Platinum in 2003 and a limited 30th anniversary edition in 2011. The HP-12C is HP's longest and best-selling product, in continual production since its introduction in 1981. Due to its simple operation for key financial calculations, the calculator long ago became the de facto standard among financial professionals – for example, most investment banks issue HP-12Cs to the members of each incoming class of its investment banking analysts and associates. Its popularity has endured despite the fact that even a simple, but iterative, process such as amortizing the interest over the life of a loan—a calculation which modern spreadsheets can complete almost instantly—can take over a minute with the HP-12C. Later HP financial calculators are many times as fast with more functions, but none has been as successful. The HP-12C's programming mode is very intuitive and works like a macro operation on a computer. Basically, the keys one would press in the calculating mode to arrive at a solution are entered in the programming mode along with logical operators (""if"", ""and"", etc.) applicable to the solution. After the programming is complete, the macro will run in computation mode to save the user steps and improve accuracy. There are 99 lines of programmable memory on the HP-12C, and 400 lines on the HP-12C Platinum. The HP-12C Platinum is a revision to the successful 12C. The 12C Platinum is visibly distinguished by its silver-colored upper half as opposed to the gold-colored plate on the original 12C. The Platinum has a faster processor, larger memory and more built-in functions including the option of algebraic entry. In 2008 HP quietly supercharged the HP-12C with an Atmel AT91SAM7L128 microprocessor (based on an ARM 7TDMI 32-bitmicroprocessor core), running at 30MHz when executing code. The processor runs the HP-12C code in emulation mode delivering performance 50-150 times faster than the original, and 10-20 times faster than the Platinum version that continues to be available. HP-15C. The HP-15C is a high-end scientific programmable with a root-solver and numerical integration. It is able to handle complex numbers and matrix operations. Although out of production, its popularity has led to high prices of US$200–400 on the used market and a petition asking HP to restart production. The HP-15C was a replacement for the (LED Display based) HP-34C. On September 1, 2011, HP announced that a limited edition 15C based on the ARM hardware used in the modern 12C would be released. HP-15C Limited Edition. The HP-15C Limited Edition is a reproduction of the 15C based on the modern ARM powered 12C hardware, released at the same time as the 30th Anniversary Edition HP-12C. This model is powered by 2 CR2032 batteries, and can easily be differentiated from original production run (1982–89) 15Cs by the ""Limited Edition"" script below the HP 15C logo, and the black text on brushed metal back label, as opposed to the white text on black of the original. HP-16C. The HP-16C is a computer programmer's calculator, designed to assist in debugging. It can display numbers in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary, and convert numbers from one base to another. A number of specialized functions are provided to assist the programmer, including left- and right-shifting, masking, and bitwise logical operations. HP has (as of 2013) never made another programmer's calculator, but has incorporated the 16C's functions in later calculator models. Arithmetic. One of the least-known features of this calculator series is the quality of the arithmetic inside them. Hewlett-Packard retained the well-known numerical analyst Prof William Kahan, from UC Berkeley, the architect of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, to design the numerical algorithms implemented by the calculators. He also wrote parts of the manuals. Programming. The HP 10c series calculator are keystroke programmable, meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. These keystroke programs, in addition to performing any operation normally available on the keyboard, can also make use of conditional and unconditional branching and looping instructions, allowing programs to perform repetitive operations and make decisions. The available programming features differentiate between the various HP 10c series calculator systems. Clones: DM-1XC. The DM-1x series is a series of credit-card-sized calculators made by Swiss Micros (not affiliated with HP) running Voyager series firmware and looking like miniature versions of their HP equivalents. The series consists of DM-15, DM-16, DM-12, DM-11, DM-10. All calculators use the same hardware, but differ in keyboard and firmware (which can be changed with an upgrade port). These devices are essentially functional clones of the original HP models. "

wikipedia-3913007," History of Rangers F.C.  Rangers F.C., formed in 1872, are the first club in the world to win more than 50 league titles, currently 55. The club is also the most honoured in the world winning 116 trophies in total. Over its 141 years history, Rangers have only been managed by thirteen different men. This article tells the story of the club from its beginnings to the European Cup Winners Cup success, the 1902 and 1971 Ibrox disasters, the Nine in a Row league championship wins, and the collapse and insolvency following gross financial mismanagement. The history is divided into sections regarding the manager of the club rather than sections of major events. There are some overlaps between managers tenures, namely the Nine in a Row success which began with Graeme Souness and continued under Walter Smith. Formation and early years. In 1872, the club was formed by a group of rowing enthusiasts, Peter Campbell, William McBeath and brothers, Peter and Moses McNeil saw a group of men playing football on Glasgow Green's Flesher's Haugh. Indeed the team's first game was at Flesher's Haugh in May 1872 against Callander, which resulted in a 0–0 draw. Moses McNeil suggested the name Rangers after seeing the name in a book about English Rugby. Rangers only played two matches in their birth year and their second match, with the team donned in light blue shirts, was a comprehensive 11–0 win over a team named Clyde (not the present Clyde). Rangers began to grow into a more formal football club and in 1876, for the first time, a player was called up to play international football as Moses McNeil made his Scotland debut against Wales. In 1888 the now famous Old Firm fixture was born as Rangers met Celtic for the first time in a friendly match. Celtic beat Rangers 5–2 with a team composed largely of ""guest players"" from Hibernian. The 1890–91 season saw the inception of the Scottish Football League, and Rangers were one of ten original members. By this time Rangers were playing at the first Ibrox Stadium. Rangers' first ever league match took place on 16 August 1890 and resulted in a 5–2 victory over Heart of Midlothian. After finishing equal-top with Dumbarton a play-off was held at Cathkin Park to decide the who would be champions. The match finished 2–2 and the title was shared for the only time in its history, the first of Rangers' world record 54 championships. Rangers had to wait until 1894 to taste their first Scottish Cup success after losing to Vale of Leven in 1877 and 1879 but finally lifted the trophy for the first time after a 3–1 win over Celtic. Rangers even came close to winning the English FA Cup in 1887 when they lost to Aston Villa in the semi-final. Rangers ended the nineteenth century with further Scottish Cup wins 1897 and 1898 and a League Championship win in 1899 during which they won every one of their 18 league matches. Rangers formally became a limited company on 27 May 1899 and the then match secretary William Wilton was appointed as the clubs first manager. This also enabled Ibrox stadium to be constructed that same year. The club also appointed its first board of directors under the chairmanship of James Henderson. By the turn of the century Rangers had won two league titles and three Scottish Cups and were well on their way to becoming one of Scotland's top clubs. The Wilton years. Rangers were in the ascendancy at the turn of the century, winning the championship seven times between 1900 and 1918 (with four League title in a row). The season of 1898–99 was particularly memorable, in that it saw the Gers win all 18 league games to establish a perfect record. But between 1902 and 1910, Celtic took over as the dominant force, and though Rangers had the chance to foil a third League and Cup double in 1909, the Scottish FA withheld the Cup due to disgraceful scenes after a pitch invasion by drunken fans. The Hampden Riot had written itself a sorry page in the history books, and both clubs were ordered to compensate hosts Queen's Park for the damage caused by their so – called fans. Having lost the title in 1919 they responded in 1920 with one of the best seasons in their history as manager William Wilton and his right hand man Bill Struth retained the title netting 106 goals in 42 league games. However, in May 1920 the clubs first ever manager, William Wilton, died in a boating accident and Bill Struth was subsequently appointed manager. Struth's era. The key statistic of the 1930s was three consecutive Scottish Cup wins from 1934, 1935, 1936. History was there to be made in 1937 when they set out on the trail of a fourth win, only to lose in the First round to lowly Queen of the South. Ironically, this was the first Rangers game ever to be immortalised on film. The post-war seasons saw Rangers well on top, but not before a boardroom coup in the summer of 1947. The board of Rangers had previously been an amateur body made up of former players, but when chairman James Bowie suggested a 71-year-old Struth retire in order to allow a younger man to take charge, a revolution occurred. Bowie was forced out the chair and was said never to have set foot in Ibrox ever again such was his disdain for the circumstances of his departure. Struth went on to steer Rangers to 18 league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and 2 League Cups in his 34 year tenure as manager. He was also the first Rangers manager to win the domestic treble when it was achieved for the first time in Scottish football history in season 1948–49, the success based on the so-called Iron Curtain defence which remained virtually unchanged from 1946 to 1953. After Bill Struth collected two more domestic doubles in 1950 and 1953, Scot Symon was appointed as Rangers third manager on 15 June 1954. Under Symon. Symon continued Struth's success winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups. He also became the second manager to win the domestic treble in season 1963–64. Another purple patch began at the end of the 1950s: from 1957 until 1965. Rangers achieved four League titles, plus an equal number of wins in both League and FA Cups. This was the era of Slim Jim Baxter, a superb ballplayer who was by turns exhilarating and exasperating. But though Baxter was to depart for England in 1965, there was a player who had been a first – team regular for the past couple of seasons who would mature into an inspirational leader, a stalwart in the dark blue of Scotland and would eventually manage the club. John Greig was that man, and though Rangers would play out the decade in the shadow of their European Cup – winning neighbours, the foundations were being laid for future success. In season 1956–57 Symon took Rangers into the European Cup for the first time but it ended abruptly, going out on to French team Nice. The following season however saw Rangers suffer their worst ever defeat to their arch rivals Celtic, losing 7–1 in the League Cup final of 1957. They did however reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960 losing eventually to German club Eintracht Frankfurt by a record aggregate 12–4 for a Scottish team. In 1961 Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the Cup Winners' Cup final against Italian side Fiorentina, only to lose 4–1 on aggregate. Rangers suffered yet more despair in the final of the same competition in 1967, losing 1–0 after extra time to Bayern Munich. After these disappointments, the pressure was on Symon and he paid the penalty of Celtic's success in Scotland and Europe in October 1967, giving way to his former assistant Davie White after rejecting a move to make him general manager with White in charge of team affairs. White takes charge. David White was installed as Rangers' fourth manager on 1 November 1967. He had initially come to Rangers as assistant to manager Symon as part of a grooming process, giving him time to learn the ropes and take over when he was ready. However, it didn't turn out that way and the responsibility came too early. White was on his own and in charge after just five months at the club and aged just 34-years-old. When White took up the reins at Rangers, the team had failed to win the league championship in three seasons, the longest title drought in 50 years. He also happened to be up against one of the greatest ever Celtic managers, in Jock Stein, and teams, the 1967 European Cup Final side. White started incredibly well and went on to win 19 of his first 20 league matches in charge, amassing 39 out of a possible 40 points. The only blemish being a 2–2 draw at Celtic Park on 2 January, which happened to be the sides third game in only four days. The Scottish Cup gave White his first defeat as Rangers manager. A third round replay against Hearts on 13 March looked to be heading for extra time, when in the 87th minute, Donald Ford struck the winner for Hearts. Rangers were out the Cup. Incredibly, this was White's only loss in his first 30 domestic games in charge. A couple of draws in April, and White's first league defeat in the final minute of the final game of the season, 3–2 at home to Aberdeen, cost Rangers the title by two points. Despite accumulating the highest percentage of points won by any Rangers side since Bill Struth's first season and collecting 61 points, which would have won the title in 11 of the past 12 seasons, Rangers were beaten by Celtic. Their Old Firm rivals amassed 63 points and following the Ne'erday derby draw gone on to win all of their remaining league fixtures. In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign that season Rangers reached the quarter-finals, meeting Leeds United in March 1968. After a 0–0 draw at Ibrox, two goals in six minutes at Elland Road in the second leg were enough to see Leeds progress 2–0 aggregate. Leeds United went on to win the Fairs Cup. The 1968–69 season was to be White's one and only full season in charge at the club. He made two major signings at the start of the season. The first was when he broke the Scottish transfer record and outbid the English Champions Everton to buy Colin Stein from Hibernian for £100,000. Secondly he paid St. Johnstone £50,000 for Alex MacDonald. The league campaign till the end of November was inconsistent, 4 draws and 3 defeats from 13 matches, although the side did win the first Old Firm match 4–2 at Celtic Park. Rangers went on a run from December until April where they lost only once in all competitions, 3–2 away to Airdrieonians in the league. The seemed to be unstoppable, an example being one week in the middle of March (15th–22nd), when Rangers beat Clyde 6–0 at Ibrox in the league on the Saturday, with Stein scoring hat-trick before being sent-off, four days later the side beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 at home in the Fairs Cup then followed this three days later by hammering Aberdeen 6–1 in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Stein's disciplinary record caught up with him and he was suspended from the end of March until the end of the season. Without his goals the team dropped six points from the final six league games and conceded the title to Celtic by five points. The route to the 1969 Scottish Cup Final saw Rangers dispose of Hibernian, Hearts and Airdrieonians before meeting Aberdeen in the semi-final. In the final, with Stein suspended, White opted to play Alex Ferguson rather than Sandy Jardine, purely because of the aerial threat of Billy McNeill at corners. Ferguson was blamed for a goal that Rangers conceded only two minutes into the match in which he was designated to mark goalscorer McNeill. Two horrendous mistakes from Örjan Persson and Norrie Martin minutes before the interval, were both seized upon by the 20-year-old George Connolly, resulted in two goals to give Celtic a 3–0 lead at half-time. Rangers lost the game 0–4 and Ferguson was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side. The Fairs Cup proved fertile once again. Rangers went all the way to the semi-finals, defeating FK Vojvodina (2–1 on aggregate), Dundalk (9–1 on aggregate), DWS Amsterdam (4–1 on aggregate), Bilbao (4–3 on aggregate) before losing 0–2 to Newcastle United on aggregate. The tie was basically lost at Ibrox as Rangers were held to a 0–0 draw, despite numerous chances and yet another missed penalty from Andy Penman. Newcastle United went on to win the trophy. Having brought the legendary Jim Baxter back home at the start of the 1969–70 season, White's faith was repaid immediately when in his first game back at Ibrox, Baxter masterminded a famous 2–1 comeback victory over Celtic in the League Cup sectional round that had the crowd in raptures. In the Cup Winners Cup we beat Steau 2–0 at home, and held out in Bucharest for a 0–0 draw where White cleverly employed John Greig in a sweeper's role. In the second round, despite losing 1–3 away to Górnik Zabrze, confidence was still high that the Rangers could overcome them at Ibrox. He was promising to, ""attack, attack, attack!"" in order to progress. Baxter scored a stunning goal after 18 minutes, and it all looked to be going to plan as Rangers sustained pressure continued for the first hour, and then the game changed. Gornik started to play and scored three quite brilliant goals in the final half hour as they toyed with Rangers, looking as if they could score at will. Gornik were applauded off the park. The next day, 27 November 1969, White's assistant Willie Thornton took over as caretaker and the club began to look for a new manager. The lack of honours during White's reign at Ibrox, however, masks the fact that he did improve the team during a difficult period. Celtic, under Stein, were at the peak of their success and White, as Rangers' first track suit manager working on the pitch with the players every day, did not fail through any lack of tactical knowledge. In his two seasons in charge Rangers had finished 2 points and 5 points behind Celtic. White was replaced by Willie Waddell, the former Rangers legendary winger, who had also won the Championship as a manager in 1965 with Kilmarnock, before returning to journalism with the Daily Express, where he was heavily critical of Rangers, and White in particular, referring to him as 'the Boy David'. With Waddell in charge, the next three seasons saw Rangers finish 12, 15 and 16 points adrift of Celtic in the Championship – 2 points for a win back then. The team also failed to beat Celtic in 10 of the 11 games it played with Waddell at the helm. European success and national tragedy. William Waddell, a former player who had made himself a name both in journalism and as the manager of Kilmarnock's championship-winning side of 1964–65, was appointed as Rangers manager on 8 December the same year. In 1972 he guided Rangers to their first, and to date only, European triumph when they defeated Dynamo Moscow 3–2 in the Cup Winners' Cup final at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Due to a pitch invasion at the end of the match, the team were presented with the trophy in the dressing room. Following pressure exerted by the Spanish Government of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, UEFA banned Rangers from defending the cup. This was perceived by some as a disproportionate and politically motivated decision, as evidenced by Barcelona's decision to invite Rangers to participate in their pre-season Trofeo Joan Gamper tournament (named after the club's founder) in 1974, alongside the Basque team Athletic Club de Bilbao. The triumph in the European Cup Winners' Cup came less than two years after the 1971 Ibrox disaster, when 66 people died leaving the east terrace at staircase 13. Within weeks of their European success, Waddell moved to the general manager position and his coach Jock Wallace was appointed as manager. The reasons for the 51 year-old Waddell relinquishing the reins at Rangers were never fully explained but he probably saw the coaching of players as a younger mans job. He also became determined to complete the reconstruction of Ibrox Stadium. Waddell's spell can only be seen as a unique achievement. In just little over two years he had enforced discipline and order to the club. This in turn brought European success and broke the dominance of Celtic, if only in the League Cup. Waddell also oversaw the recovery after the second Ibrox disaster, helping the families of the victims and forging strong links with supports' clubs. Wallace becomes manager. Jock Wallace's managership of Rangers saw the club achieve a period of sustained success. His first season as manager, 1972–73 was the club's centenary year. After taking over the first-team managers position on 31 May 1972, Wallace set about reshaping the side. He moved on Colin Stein and Willie Johnston to Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion respectively, bringing in Quinton Young, Joe Mason and Tom Forsyth. After a stuttering start to the league campaign, three defeats and a draw from the first six matches, the sides fortunes greatly improved. From October to the end of the season Rangers suffered only one league defeat, at home to Hearts on 2 December 1972, and went on a run of sixteen wins. However this run was not enough to become league champions as the side finished second, one point behind Celtic. In the cup competitions, the Scottish Cup campaign was to culminate in a 3–2 win over Celtic. The final was attended by Princess Alexandra along with 122,714 other spectators. It was Rangers first Scottish Cup win in seven years. The League Cup run was ended in the semi-finals at the hands of Hibernian after a 1–0 defeat. This season also saw compete in the first ever European Super Cup. The side played the European Cup holders Ajax in January 1973. The Dutch side were the only continental opposition the side faced that season due to the club's European competition ban. In the end Ajax proved to strong and recorded a 6–3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1–3 at Ibrox and 3–2 in Amsterdam. In the summer of 1973 Rangers chairman John Lawerence retired and was replaced by vice-chairman Matt Taylor. A nine-year period of Celtic dominance in the league was ended in 1974–75 as Rangers captured what was to be the last championship of its kind. The new ten-team Scottish Premier Division saw Rangers crowned inaugural champions, as part of a triumphant domestic treble. A barren subsequent season in 1976–77. Wallace presided over the club's fourth domestic treble and second in three years in 1977–78. During the close season Rangers spent heavily in the transfer market, bringing in Davie Cooper from Clydebank for £100,000 and Gordon Smith from Kilmarnock for £65,000. They were joined at the club by Bobby Russell who arrived from Shettleston Juniors for free. Despite these expensive signings the side did not make the best start to the league campaign, losing the opening two matches to Aberdeen and Hibernian. Order was restored the following week with a 4–0 defeat of Partick Thistle. A resounding 3–2 win over Celtic in the first Old Firm match of the season set the tone of the season. Rangers had been 2–0 down at half-time but recovered to win the game after outclassing Jock Stein's side in the second 45 minutes. In March 1978, second placed Aberdeen won 3–0 at Ibrox to set up a tense title run in. Rangers dropped seven points from twenty-one but held on winning the final four fixtures and the league. The League Cup was won by defeating Celtic 2–1 after extra time. Goals from season new boys Davie Cooper and Gordon Smith completed the first leg of the treble. The 2–1 1978 Scottish Cup Final win over Aberdeen made Wallace the only Rangers' manager to win two domestic treble's. Surprisingly despite this unprecedented success Wallace resigned from his position on 23 May 1978. The reason for his departure was never revealed but it is widely believed that a breakdown in the working relationship between Wallace and general manager William Waddell was the cause. At a time when Ibrox Park was undergoing extensive redevelopment the transfer budget was to suffer. Waddell was suspected of vetoing many signings, Alan Hansen from Partick Thistle and David Narey from Dundee United among them, in favour of investing in the rebuilding project. The burst of success under Wallace in the mid-1970s saw Rangers once again established as Scotland's most successful club. When Wallace, suddenly and unexpectedly, announced his resignation, Rangers turned to another of the stalwarts of the great side of the mid-to-late 1970s, the captain John Greig. Greig: Captain to manager. After the departure of Wallace the board acted quickly to replace the void with club captain Greig being promoted to first-team manager. Greig took a phone call on the day of Wallace's resignation from general manager Waddell. Greig was playing golf with team-mate Sandy Jardine when Waddell called him to offer him the job. On 24 May 1978 Greig was confirmed as the seventh manager of Rangers. Greig's tenure began promisingly. The 1978–79 season could so easily have mirrored the previous. Despite a fixture pile-up which resulted from the club playing three league games in nearly three months, and some overly negative tactics from Greig, Rangers came close to winning a quadruple of trophies. Unfortunately it was not to be and the season ended with just the domestic cup double. Wallace's treble-winning team of the previous season performed ably in the European Cup. Rangers eliminated Juventus after defeating the Italians 2–1 on aggregate – the first time Rangers had ever recovered from a first-leg defeat to win a two-legged European tie. Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, the then UEFA Cup holders, were overcome in the next round (the club's first home defeat in European competition), before an injury-stricken Rangers side lost to Cologne at the quarter-final stage. The early season league form was terrible as the team failed to win any of the first six league matches but a run was put together. Things began to unravel, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind champions Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4–2 Old Firm defeat a Parkhead. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final over Hibernian required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3–2. The 1979 Scottish League Cup Final ended in a 2–1 win for Rangers over a strong Aberdeen with goals from Alex MacDonald and Colin Jackson. The following the season finished trophyless. Rangers finished an embarrassing fifth in the league, eleven points behind champions Aberdeen. The main cause for such a poor showing in the league was pointed at the teams away form, only ten points from eighteen matches. Aberdeen also knocked Rangers out of the Scottish League Cup over a two-legged third round tie. Rangers did reach the 1980 Scottish Cup Final only to lose out to Old Firm rivals Celtic, 1–0 thanks to a deflected George McCluskey shot in extra time. The European Cup Winner's Cup campaign was ended by the eventual winners Valencia CF after having seen off Lilliestrom and Fortuna Düsseldorf in previous rounds. The summer of 1980 saw Greig bring in Jim Bett from Lokeren for £150,000. Bett was joined by Colin McAdam a £165,000 signing from Partick Thistle. The side got off to a good start in the league, going on a fifteen match unbeaten run, including two Old Firm wins, was to end in November. A disastrous run in November and December all but ended the title challenge as the team finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup campaign was halted after a controversial defeat to Aberdeen in a match where the Dons were awarded two contentious penalties. Due to having no European participation, Rangers entered the Anglo-Scottish Cup which led to humiliation and embarrassment at the hands of English minnows, Chesterfield. The third division side held Rangers to a 1–1 draw at Ibrox before thumping Rangers 3–0 in the away leg at Saltergate. Rangers did win the 1981 Scottish Cup Final after beating Dundee United 4–1 in a final replay. After a tedious 0–0 draw where Ian Redford missed a last minute penalty, Rangers won the replay with goals from Davie Cooper, a John MacDonald double and Bobby Russell. Greig's fourth season in charge, 1981–82, ended yet again without the league championship. Rangers finished third, twelve points behind Old Firm rivals Celtic who were champions. There was an apparent lack of ambition at the club due a lack of transfer funds which were being directed towards the redevelopment of Ibrox Park. There was the surprise signing of Northern Ireland international John McClelland from Mansfield Town. The Ulsterman proved to be a shrewd acquisition and later became the club captain. European participation was halted by Dukla Prague who soundly beat the team 3–0 in Prague and a 2–1 second leg win for Rangers was not enough for the team to progress. The domestic cup competitions proveded successful ground as Rangers reached both finals. The team lost the 1982 Scottish Cup Final 4–1 to Aberdeen despite leading for the majority of the match. A late Aberdeen equaliser took the game into extra-time before the Dons added a trio. Rangers did win the 1982 Scottish League Cup Final by defeating Dundee United 2–1 with goals from Davie Cooper and Ian Redford. Greig made big-money signings in the pre-season 1982–83 with renewed hope that they could at least mount a serious title challenge, but once again, the season ended in trophyless failure. Dave MacKinnon – £30,000 from Partick Thistle, Craig Paterson – £200,000 from Hibernian, Robert Prytz from Malmö FF and Sandy Clark from West Ham United, were all welcomed to the club. The early signs were positive. Rangers reached the 1983 Scottish League Cup Final scoring en route 29 goals in their ten games and eliminated Borussia Dortmund from the UEFA Cup. The opening eight league games saw the side unbeaten but the final match saw Rangers lying in fourth, a massive eighteen points behind champions Dundee United. The team was knocked out of Europe after suffering a 5–0 defeat from Cologne. The 1983 Scottish Cup Final was lost to an Aberdeen side that had won the European Cup Winner's Cup ten days earlier. The 1983–84 season would signal the end of John Greig's managerial career. The league season began badly, one point from the first four league games, although the team did win their six League Cup games under Greig. A fruitful brief run in the European Cup Winner's Cup saw Rangers win the second round, first leg 2–1 over F.C. Porto after the team's record breaking 18–0 aggregate win over Maltese champions Valletta. After the first nine league games, Greig's team had collected just ten points from twenty-seven. In the end the pressure was to much and Greig resigned from his post on 28 October 1983. Greig's efforts to restructure the team inherited from Wallace proved, for the most part, fruitless. The early years of the 1980s were ones of repeated frustration as the club continually failed to mount a challenge not only to Celtic, but to the resurgent New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United. The gloom of under-performance in the league was punctuated only by periodic cup triumphs. The Scottish Cup win of 1981, in particular, saw a triumphant performance by the enigmatic winger, Davie Cooper. The League Cup proved fertile territory for Rangers throughout the fallow years of the early 1980s, but it was the failure to add to the league triumph of 1978 that saw the growing pressure on Greig culminate in his resignation as manager in October 1983. During this period attendances at Ibrox dwindled from an average 25,628 in season 1978–79 to 17,681 in 1982–83. Return of Wallace. Rangers hoped to rekindle success by bringing Jock Wallace back to the club, following his exile in England with Leicester City. Wallace, though, was not the club's first choice: Jim McLean and Alex Ferguson, the then managers of the New Firm clubs, both rebuffed Rangers' advances. McLean's brother Tommy was appointed caretaker manager and four games passed before a permanent manager was in position. On 10 November 1983, Jock Wallace was persuaded by the Rangers board to leave Motherwell and return to the club. His aim was to restore the glory years of the treble-winning sides of the late 1970s. Wallace's initial impact was positive, boosting morale and fitness. He made changes to the coaching staff, bringing in Alex Totten as first team coach with Tommy McLean, David Provan and Joe Mason leaving. Wallace also added to the squad during the season, Bobby Williamson arrived from Clydebank, Nicky Walker from old club Motherwell and Stuart Munro from Alloa Athletic. Wallace's first match in command was at Pittodrie on 12 November 1983. The game ended in a 3–0 defeat but the side went on a 22 match unbeaten run in all competitions until March 1984. Yet, Rangers still ended that season fourth in the league, fifteen points behind champions Aberdeen. The club did win a trophy, the 1984 Scottish League Cup. It was a thrilling extra time victory over Celtic, with Ally McCoist getting a hat-tick, in a 3–2 win that won them the cup. The 1984–85 season, Wallace's first full season in charge since his return, was almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. Rangers again finished fourth in the league but it was by a record twenty-one point margin behind champions Aberdeen. This disappointing performance was not caused due to a lack of investment in the playing squad. A total of £495,000 was spent bringing in Iain Ferguson and Cammy Fraser from Dundee, Ted McMinn from Queen of the South and bringing back Derek Johnstone from Chelsea. The club won the Scottish League Cup for the second season in a row defeating Dundee United in the final. A solitary Iain Ferguson strike gave Rangers a 1–0 win. A reasonable start was made to Wallace's second full season in charge. Five wins out of six matches in the league plus a further two wins in the League Cup. However, things quickly began to sour as a fall out between manager and then club captain, John McClelland saw the latter stripped of the captaincy. McClelland was soon sold to Watford in November 1985 for £265,000. The Ulsterman was missed and the team's form was to suffer. By the turn of the year Rangers were in third position in the league. From 1 January 1986, the side won only a quarter of the remaining sixteen league fixtures. With no hope of a trophy, after defeats in the Scottish Cup third round and the League Cup semi-final, things looked bleak for the club. So perhaps it came as no surprise that on 7 April 1986, Jock Wallace resigned as manager of the club. He was to jump before being pushed by the then newly appointed Rangers chairman David Holmes. Holmes had gone on record saying that the slump the club was in could not be allowed to go on. Wallace's side might have won the League Cup twice in a row, but the league form remained indifferent. The continuing dominance of the great Aberdeen side of the 1980s, coupled with strong Dundee United and Celtic teams that offered periodic challenges to Aberdeen's ascendancy, placed Wallace under increasing pressure. By the 1985–86 season Rangers had slipped to fifth place in the league and, with little evidence of improvement since the Greig era, it was inevitable that Wallace would be removed as manager. However, the search for Wallace's replacement was a brief one. The Souness Revolution. In April 1986, Graeme Souness was appointed as Rangers' first player-manager by chairman David Holmes. Souness had previously been playing in Italy with U.C. Sampdoria and made the move to Glasgow for a £300,000 fee. This was the first of many big money transfer deals to be made at Rangers. Although the first deal Souness was involved with was regarding his backroom staff. He brought in Walter Smith, from Dundee United as his assistant and ex-Coventry City manager Don Mackay as reserve-team coach. Souness' first flurry into the transfer market resulted in a £175,000 purchase, Colin West. The investment made in West was small compared to that made in other members of the playing staff. Souness took advantage of the European competition ban imposed by UEFA on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Due to this, plus a sizeable transfer kitty, he was able to attract the cream of English sides talent. The first of many international players arrived in the shape of Chris Woods, followed by the likes of England deputy captain Terry Butcher and former Manchester United defender Jimmy Nicholl. The 1986–87 season would be the first time in eight seasons that Rangers finished top of the Scottish Premier Division. But the season began eventfully with player-manager Souness being sent-off in the first league match of the season on 9 August 1986. A violent foul on Hibernian's George McCluskey meant Souness had to watch the 2–1 defeat from the stands. But forty-three matches; thirty-one wins, seven draws and five defeats later Rangers were the champions. The league crown was not Souness' first Rangers trophy however, a 2–1 win over Celtic gave them a 1986 Scottish League Cup Final win. He also won the Glasgow Cup thanks to an Ally McCoist hat-trick. That same season, goalkeeper Chris Woods set the then British football shut out record of 1196 minutes. From 26 November 1986, when he conceded a goal in a UEFA Cup 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, until 14 games later on 30 January 1987 when Adrian Sprott of Hamilton Academical knocked Rangers out of the Scottish Cup by a single goal. The following season Rangers could not build on the success of the previous. Despite the arrival's of Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins, Mark Walters, Mark Falco, John Brown and Richard Gough, who became Scotland's first £1 million player. The title defence began badly, three points from the first ten, that added with injuries and suspensions meant the club finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup Final victory was the only bright spark that season, although there was a decent run the European Cup with Dynamo Kiev and David White's foes Górnik Zabrze as scalps. A final against Aberdeen saw Rangers win 5–3 on penalties after drawing 3–3. The Scottish Cup ended in the fourth round at the hands of Dunfermline Athletic. Nine in a row. Rangers had previously won nine titles in a row before during the period directly before and following into the Second World War. However the league championships won during wartime are not officially recongised. Due to the depletion of the squads as players left to help with the war effort, the Scottish Football Association suspended legitimate competitions and set up regional league competitions in their place. Souness years. The 1988–89 season was to start what would be one of the most successful spells of Rangers history. When Souness' side regained the league championship by a margin of six points from second-placed Aberdeen, few could predict that would be the first of many. The club had again invested heavily in the playing staff. Again the club imported players from English sides with Gary Stevens joining from Everton and Kevin Drinkell from Norwich City. A pre-season spent in Italy was the perfect build-up to the new season. The team were unbeaten in all competitions in August and September, including a 5–1 mauling of Celtic at Ibrox. The initiative gained was never really lost and Rangers collected fifty-six points from thirty-six games, twenty-six of which were victories. The League Cup was again at Ibrox as the side again beat a determined Aberdeen team. The final came just a fortnight after the sides met in the league, Rangers lost 2–1 in the Granite City. During the game Aberdeen's Neil Simpson inflicted a terrible tackle on Rangers midfielder Ian Durrant which left the latter with a knee injury for over three years. But for a 1–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1989 Scottish Cup Final, the treble would have rested at Ibrox that season. The arrival of businessman David Murray in 1988 continued the Rangers' resurgence. Murray had acquired Rangers for £6 million from the club's then owner, the Nevada-based Lawrence Marlborough on 23 November 1988. History could have been very different however, had he not been rejected by home town club Ayr United. Murray officially became chairman on 2 June 1989, replacing David Holmes. Murray retained the ambitious strategy he had inherited from Holmes. This was demonstrated on 10 July 1989 when Rangers, acting on Souness' say so, purchased former Celtic striker Mo Johnston from French club Nantes for £1.5 million. The fact Rangers signed an ex-Celtic player would have been a big enough story but the fact Johnston was a high-profile Roman Catholic made the move unprecedented. The transfer angered both sides of the Old Firm's support, Rangers because Johnston was an ex-Celt and Catholic (Rangers, seen as the Protestant club in Glasgow and signing Catholics was a rare occurrence) and Celtic fans saw Johnston as a turncoat who had already committed to re-join Celtic from Nantes before Rangers made known their interest. When the season began, Rangers did not. Three matches played in the league, no wins and two defeats. However, the team slowly got into gear, despite only two wins from the first eight games. New arrival Johnston netted the crucial winner during an Old Firm game on 4 November 1989. Scoring the goal in the dying minutes of the match meant Johnston was all but forgiven by the Rangers support. Come May 1990, Rangers' name was on the trophy for the second time in as many seasons but the club again failed to win the Scottish Cup, losing to Celtic in the fourth round, and for once did not win the League Cup. The side lost to Aberdeen by 2–1 in the final. The 1990–91 season would be Souness's last season in charge. On 16 April 1991, the fiery Scot departed for his former club Liverpool before the league campaign reached its dramatic culmination, saying he had ""gone as far as he would be allowed to go"". A last-day victory over Aberdeen at Ibrox gave Rangers ""Three in a Row"". Souness assistant Walter Smith was in charge that day. Before his departure Souness had made sure to fall out with and sell on club captain Terry Butcher and spend big money on striker Mark Hateley, winger Pieter Huistra and forgotten man Oleg Kuznetsov. Sadly for Souness though he was never to win a Scottish Cup with Rangers as the team went down 2–0 to Celtic at Parkhead, for the second season in a row. The 1990 Scottish League Cup Final ended in another victory however. The Souness years were marked by both achievement and conflict. Under Souness's stewardship, Rangers' preeminence in the Scottish game was restored. At a time in which English clubs were excluded from European competition, the club also gained arguably a higher profile in the British game than at any time in its history. This was fuelled by the purchase of a succession of English internationals, including Ray Wilkins, Terry Butcher and Chris Woods. It was also fuelled by the controversial signing of Roman Catholic and former Celtic player Mo Johnston, who was persuaded to change his mind at the last minute and sign for Rangers rather than their bitter city rivals. Johnston's signing led to outrage from some fans of the traditionally Protestant club as he became the first high-profile Catholic to sign for Rangers in modern times. Despite his success, Souness was never part of the Scottish footballing establishment. His managership saw countless run-ins with the footballing authorities. He was sent off in his debut and suffered more than one touchline ban. Souness's departure met with mixed reactions amongst Rangers supporters. Many were disappointed, some bemoaned what they saw as his betrayal of the club, all however, were united in viewing the Souness revolution as amongst the most dramatic period in Rangers history. Smith's tenure. The ninth manager of Rangers was a man who had previously worked as assistant to the eighth, Walter Smith. He was appointed manager on 19 April 1991, a day before a crucial Scottish Premier Division match away to St. Mirren. Smith guided the side to a 1–0 win and followed that with a similar result at home to Dundee United before a devastating 3–0 loss away to Motherwell nearly derailed the sides championship hopes. A last supreme effort was required if the club was to claim a third league title in succession. The final league game of the season was at home to title challengers Aberdeen, with a draw being all that was needed by the Dons to be crowned champions. A tense match ensured but a Mark Hateley brace in front of a 37,652-strong Ibrox crowd gave Rangers the win and the league championship. In his first full season in charge, Smith began to make changes. He brought in Archie Knox from Manchester United, as his assistant and also altered the playing personnel. Smith moved on Trevor Steven for a fee of £5.58 million to Olympique Marseille. Amongst those who also left were Chris Woods, Mo Johnston, Mark Walters to Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Liverpool respectively. Smith, with the financial backing of Chairman David Murray, signed Andy Goram, Alexei Mikhailichenko, Stuart McCall, David Robertson and the perhaps less successful pair of Dale Gordon and Paul Rideout. A fourth successive championship was secured that season, for the first time in over sixty years. Rangers topped the Division with a total of seventy-two points, nine ahead of second-placed Heart of Midlothian. The side scored one hundred and one goals and were victorious in nineteen of their twenty-two away fixtures. The success continued into the Scottish Cup as Rangers won the 1992 final beating Airdrieonians 2–1 to win the trophy for the first time in eleven years. The 1992–93 season was arguably one of the most successful in the club's history and the best European campaign since 1972. Not only did the team win the domestic treble but they also came to within one match of the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final. Rangers saw off English First Division champions Leeds United in a tie dubbed the Battle of Britain. Then, in the group stage, Rangers won two matches and drew four but, despite remaining undefeated, went out to the French team Olympique de Marseille, who were later found guilty of match fixing. No foul play was found with regards to the Rangers matches however. Rangers won the double the following season but missed out on a back-to-back domestic treble after losing in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final to Dundee United. It was a classic giant killing act. United had had a fairly moderate season, winning only eleven of their forty-four league matches. It was United's seventh appearance in a Scottish Cup final, having lost all six of their previous encounters. A forty-seventh minute Craig Brewster goal gave Dundee United a 1–0 win after a sloppy back pass by Dave McPherson. It was a strange end to a very successful domestic season for Rangers. The 1994–95 season saw Rangers make two big money signings, Basile Boli and Brian Laudrup, for £2.7 million and £2.4 million respectively. The latter proved to be an absolute bargain. Laudrup became a firm fans favourite during his four-year spell with Rangers and was even elected to the Rangers Hall of Fame. Boli on the other hand lasted just one season. The French defender completely failed to adapt to the rigours of the Scottish game. Despite the failure of a rather expensive footballer, Rangers continued to rack up the league titles. The sixth consecutive championship won in style. The club sat top of the Scottish Premier Division on sixty-nine points, a whole fifteen points ahead of second placed Motherwell. Yet both domestic cup competitions ended before the last eight and the failure to reached the UEFA Champions League group stage, meant that to many, the season was almost regarded as a failure. Rangers won the championship in season 1995–96 with the help of one Paul Gascoigne. The Englishman was signed 10 July 1995 from Italian side Lazio. He made an instant impact at Rangers, running almost the length of the pitch to score in an Old Firm match at Celtic Park, during the fifth league game of the season. On 30 December 1995, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne 'booked' referee Dougie Smith. Smith had dropped his yellow card and Gascoigne picked it up and showed it to the official, before returning it. Smith was not amused and booked Gascoigne. Rangers went on to win the league, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen. After Rangers went 1–0 down in the early stages, Gascoigne went on to score a hat-trick to give the club a 3–1 victory and the championship. Joining the league crown in the Ibrox trophy cabinet was the 1996 Scottish Cup which Rangers won after a 5–1 defeat of Hearts. A hat-trick from Gordon Durie and a Brian Laudrup double won Rangers their 27th Scottish Cup win. In season 1996–97 Rangers went on to win their ninth championship in a row thereby equalling Celtic's achievement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the cup competitions, they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup at the quarter-finals stage, losing 2–0 to Celtic. But the team won the Scottish League Cup, defeating Hearts 4–3. The European campaign proved to be a disaster. Although the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League after a fine 10–3 aggregate win over Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, they only recorded three points from their six group matches. The season 1997–98 proved to be Walter Smith's last season as manager and Rangers were unable to win their tenth league championship in a row. The early season form of new signing Marco Negri gave the team fresh impetus but when the manager Walter Smith announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season the team's form dipped. The side finished the league on 72 points, two behind champions Celtic after taking the title race to the last day of the season. The club ended the season trophyless for the first time in twelve seasons as they lost the Scottish Cup final to Hearts 2–1 and were knocked out League Cup in the quarter-finals by Dundee United. In Europe, the club failed to reach the Champions League group stages and fell at the first hurdle in the UEFA Cup, losing both legs 2–1 to RC Strasbourg. Smith left Rangers and joined Premier League club Everton. Many players from the Nine in a Row era left Rangers including Brian Laudrup, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Stuart McCall and captain Richard Gough. The Little General. Dick Advocaat, nicknamed the Little General, succeeded Walter Smith on 1 June 1998. Advocaat, former manager of PSV Eindhoven, was only Rangers' tenth manager and the first non-Scot to hold the position. His appointment was viewed as reflecting a desire to begin to challenge Europe's elite clubs. David Murray, the club's owner and chairman, had long proclaimed that Rangers ought to be judged not just in relation to success in Scotland, but on performance in Europe, and especially in the UEFA Champions League. But despite being given resources on a scale never before handed to a Rangers manager, success on a larger stage failed to materialise, and the costly legacy of Advocaat's time at Ibrox was a debt that would cripple the club for years. The scale of these resources made available to Advocaat initially confirmed that the Rangers management was thinking in bold, European terms. Confronted with a rump of players remaining after Smith's departure, Advocaat was furnished with an unprecedented transfer budget over the coming seasons. In total Advocaat spent over £36 million on new players in his debut season. But while Advocaat's record in transfer dealings remained mixed throughout his time at Ibrox, at first the club appeared to be beginning to deliver in playing terms, both in Scotland and (less predictably) Europe. Advocaat's first season saw another domestic treble secured. Performance in Europe was promising, with Bayer Leverkusen defeated in a solid, if unspectacular, UEFA Cup run. In the following season, Advocaat continued to spend big, bringing the likes of Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna to Ibrox. A domestic double was secured in Advocaat's second season. In Europe, too, there were signs of greatly improved performance in the Champions League, as Parma were defeated en route to qualification for the group stages of the competition. Rangers entered Advocaat's third season emboldened by the capture of five of the six domestic trophies available in his first two years. However, while the club again qualified for the Champions League group stage, performances in the league began rapidly to disintegrate. Further high-profile signings – Tore André Flo for a club record £12 million, and the Dutch internationalist Ronald de Boer on a lavish contract – could not reverse the decline. Morale amongst players and supporters plummeted amidst credible rumours of players unrest and dressing room divides. A worsening financial position exacerbated the gathering gloom. The club failed to win a major competition in the 2000–01 season, as Celtic swept the domestic board. Having continued in similar fashion in 2001–02, and with Martin O'Neill's Celtic side once more running away with the championship, Advocaat resigned as manager and took up a general manager position, which he would leave after only 11 months. Alex McLeish was appointed the new Rangers manager in December 2001. Advocaat's tenure at Ibrox had been a paradoxical one. On one hand, Advocaat spearheaded the building of Murray Park – a £14m training complex at Auchenhowie which was viewed as essential if the club was to compete with its European peers in nurturing home-grown talent and developing players. On the other hand, with the club deep in financial difficulty, there was no realistic prospect of boosting its fortunes through further expensive player acquisitions. The challenge of restoring the club to supremacy in Scotland looked to be an unenviable one for Alex McLeish. Financial hangover under McLeish. Murray appointed ex-Aberdeen defender Alex McLeish as the clubs eleventh manager on 11 December 2001, joining McLeish was assistant Andy Watson. Murray's choice of manager was met with a lukewarm reaction amongst many Rangers supporters. Many fans viewed it as symptomatic of the downsizing of the club's ambitions, while others saw in McLeish a manager whose mixed fortunes at Hibernian and Motherwell left him ill-equipped to cope with the demands of managing a high-profile club like Rangers. However, McLeish was the number one managerial target on a four man shortlist. Others said to be included on the list were the then Ipswich Town manager George Burley, former Germany coach Berti Vogts and George Graham. Fans concerns were quickly allayed as McLeish's Rangers team began to display a spirit that had been sorely lacking in the twlight of Advocaat's reign. A Scottish Cup and League Cup double in McLeish's first half-season, 2001–02, saw a renewed sense of optimism that Rangers could regain the ascendancy claimed by Celtic under the managership of Martin O'Neill. A dramatic 3–2 defeat of Celtic in the 2002 Scottish Cup Final, orchestrated by Barry Ferguson and marked by a dramatic Peter Løvenkrands last minute winner, was the perfect end to a disappointing season. In McLeish's first full season as manager, 2002–03, the club won its seventh domestic treble. The Scottish Premier League title was secured after an astonishingly tense run-in. Going into the final round both sides were equal on 94 points but Rangers had a one-goal advantage and sat top of the league. On a dramatic last day, a 6–1 victory over Dunfermline Athletic denied Celtic the title on goal difference after the Parkhead club beat Kilmarnock 4–0. The destination of the title was unknown until the dying seconds of this match as both teams had headed into the game level on points and goal difference. Only a last-minute penalty by Mikel Arteta clinched the win. A victory over Celtic in the 2003 Scottish League Cup Final in March 2003, provided the first leg of the club's latest treble. A somewhat drab and anti-climactic 1–0 victory over Dundee in the 2003 Scottish Cup Final the following May saw a triumphant finalé to the season. It was a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows Viktoria Žižkov. The following season, McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's perilous financial position in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity. The wage bill had to be slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming and unsustainable level of debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players assembled by Advocaat, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer kitty enjoyed by some of his predecessors. McLeish was to lose, from his treble winning squad, the inspirational if mistake-prone defender Lorenzo Amoruso, Scottish international winger Neil McCann and, most damagingly of all, club captain Barry Ferguson. In their place McLeish was required to rebuild with the selective use of Bosman free transfers and loan siginings. After a good start to the 2003–04 season which saw the side top of the league and qualify for UEFA Champions League (thanks to a dramatic late goal in Denmark against FC Copenhagen), the loss of Ferguson shortly afterwards led to a dramatic downturn in results and ultimately a trophyless campaign. McLeish's Bosman signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder Emerson, Norway forward Egil Østenstad and, most damaging of all, the £600,000 signing Nuno Capucho, have since entered Ibrox folklore as some of the worst players to play for Rangers. The 2004–05 season started in the same vein, with McLeish making another poor signing in Serbian midfielder, Dragan Mladenovic, for £1m. The Serb would manage less than ten games for the club. On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new UEFA Cup group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shoot out win over CS Marítimo of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution. After this, his fortunes began to turn again. Mladenovic aside, McLeish had made some canny signings in the summer, such as Nacho Novo, plus the Bosmans Dado Pršo, Jean-Alain Boumsong along with midfielder Alex Rae. Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground on O'Neill's ageing Celtic side. Boumsong, in particular, was a great success but he was sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to then Premier League side Newcastle United (managed by former boss Graeme Souness) for £8m. This cash paved the way for more signings, including Thomas Buffel, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and the return of former captain Barry Ferguson. The 2005 Scottish League Cup Final in March 2005 ended in a 5–1 victory over Motherwell . The league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (with two Old Firm wins, including a pivotal 2–0 victory at Celtic Park in what was McLeish's first win there as Rangers manager) nerves seemed to get the better of Rangers. A loss to Celtic in the last derby of the season at Ibrox, handed a five-point lead to their rivals with only four games of remaining, and seemed to end hopes of the title. However, Rangers kept its winnings way and a 3–1 Celtic home loss to Hibernian meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season. Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at Fir Park. In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously. , Motherwell overcame a 1–0 deficit with two goals in injury time from Scott McDonald to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight 1–0 win at Easter Road. For 89 minutes of the match, Rangers thought their rivals were set for the title, and once news broke of Motherwell's late intervention, ecstasy awaited for the Ibrox legions. Even the helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Motherwell so it had to turn around and fly to Edinburgh. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as ""Helicopter Sunday"". McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title. The 2005–06 season got off to a bad start, with Rangers only winning six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on, statistically, the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win. During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table. It was widely felt that chairman David Murray would let McLeish go after the European campaign had finished, and a press conference arranged two days after the final group match seemed to confirm this. However, Murray seemed to undergo a change of heart and stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely , but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. After this announcement, the team improved, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of Kris Boyd. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run. Yet, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated. Rangers lost 3–0 at home to Hibernian on 4 February to exit the Scottish Cup and end their last realistic hopes of silverware that season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman followed the game.  Overall, McLeish's four-and-a-half-year spell at Ibrox was a turbulent one, coming as it did after the wastefulness of the Advocaat era. McLeish never enjoyed access to the funds his predecessors had been given, and his managership was marked by wildly fluctuating fortunes, in part caused by forced asset stripping of his best players due to the spectre of debt from Advocaat's spending. The lack of money certainly played its part in McLeish's downfall but it is debatable, based on the money he did have to spend, whether greater sums would have been invested wisely. Indeed there is an argument that a good proportion of McLeish's signings have been among the worst in the club's entire history. However, history will look back on McLeish's reign, as a period of tremendous transition on and off the pitch. The False Dawn. After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on 9 February 2006, two days before the crucial Old Firm match, it was announced that McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005–06 season, and on 11 March, it was confirmed that former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen would succeed him at the end of the season. Murray predicted a fruitful reign under Le Guen, describing his capture as ""a massive moonbeam of success"" for the club and promising, ""we’ve got big plans."" He announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced an arrangement with sports retailer JJB Sports. Le Guen was well known for unearthing and nurturing young talent and made an immediate splash in the transfer market. The wave of expectation that was created by Le Guen's appointment was immense and he quickly went about building his own team. In the summer of 2006 he made eleven signings (of them only Saša Papac would be playing for the club the following season). Le Guen spent big money on Filip Šebo, which proved to be wasted as the Slovakian only netted twice during the whole campaign. Other signings including Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Lionel Letizi simply did not perform, while Jérémy Clément was to be in Glasgow for only six months. He signed a young South African player Dean Furman from Chelsea, and French youngsters William Stanger and Antoine Ponroy from Rennes. He allowed more experienced players to leave, Alex Rae, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Peter Løvenkrands and Ronald Waterreus. Rangers' first match under Le Guen was a friendly against Irish Premier League champions Linfield on 6 July 2006 at Windsor Park, Belfast. The side won 2–0 with first-half goals from Kris Boyd and Thomas Buffel. The squad then flew out to South Africa on 9 July for a training camp where they were to play three matches, but defender Fernando Ricksen did not take any part in the tour of South Africa due to what was described by the club as ""unacceptable behaviour"" on the flight to Johannesburg. He returned to Scotland and was subsequently loaned to Zenit St Petersburg on 9 August. Ricksen never played for the club again as his loan spell in Russia was made permanent. The Scottish Premier League season opened on 30 July with Le Guen taking his Rangers side to Fir Park where they defeated Motherwell 2–1. In Le Guen's first competitive game at Ibrox, Rangers were held to a 2–2 draw by Dundee United, and were forced to come back from two goals down. On 11 August Rangers signed Manchester United's then 19-year-old winger Lee Martin on loan for a season. Rangers also recruited the services of Austrian Vienna defender Saša Papac while Marvin Andrews, Olivier Bernard, Robert Malcolm and Hamed Namouchi all departed. With the transfer window closed and five league matches played, Rangers had collected nine points from fifteen. The following two months showed little improvement as the side had sporadic wins and lost the first Old Firm match of the season 2–0. From the seven matches played in September and October 2006, the team won just three and gathered ten points from the twenty-one available. By mid November, Rangers found themselves in third place, a full fifteen points behind leaders Celtic. The odd win was mixed with regular dropped points as the team struggled to find consistency in the early part of the season. The culmination of this poor form could be seen when the side was embarrassingly knocked out of the League Cup by then First Division side St. Johnstone. A dismal 2–0 defeat at Ibrox Stadium on 8 November led to widespread calls for Le Guen to leave. Following the League Cup defeat, there was a slightly gain in form as the side claimed sixteen points from twenty-one, including a 1–1 Old Firm draw thanks to a late-minute Brahim Hemdani equaliser. Rangers also became the first Scottish club to qualify from the UEFA Cup group stage in December 2006, after wins over Livorno, Maccabi Haifa and Partizan Belgrade. Domestic results and performances, however, continued to be inconsistent and in January 2007, Le Guen controversially stripped midfielder Barry Ferguson of the captaincy On 4 January 2007, Le Guen left Rangers by mutual consent. This made him the club's shortest-serving manager, and the only one to leave the club without completing a full season in charge. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published a book which speculated Le Guen left the club because he was being ""undermined"" by other Rangers personnel. Those named were Ferguson and the then club doctor, Ian McGuinness. Walter Smith's return. Following the departure of Paul Le Guen, a number of media sources reported an ""understanding"" that the new management structure would consist of former Rangers manager Walter Smith and former player Ally McCoist, and the SFA confirmed that Rangers enquired about the availability of the pair. However, on 8 January, the SFA rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith. On 10 January 2007, it was announced that Walter Smith was the new manager of Rangers, with Ally McCoist confirmed as assistant manager and Kenny McDowall as first team coach. Smith and his team undertook some serious surgery to the side. He signed experienced defenders David Weir, Ugo Ehiogu and Andy Webster to shore up the rocky backline. This proved to be a steadying influence on the team and they only lost three times until the end of the season, although Webster injured himself during his first training session at the club and did not make his debut until September 2007. The following summer, Smith made ten signings, including defender Carlos Cuéllar and midfielder Lee McCulloch. The early season priority, qualification for the Champions League group stage, was secured after aggregate victories over the champions of the Montenegrin and Serbian leagues, FK Zeta and Red Star Belgrade respectively. Rangers were drawn in Group E, to play FC Barcelona, French champions Olympique Lyonnais and German champions VfB Stuttgart. The campaign started well for Rangers with two victories, 2–1 at home to Stuttgart and 3–0 against Lyon at the Stade Gerland as well as a 0–0 draw against Barcelona at Ibrox Stadium. They lost match day six against Olympique Lyonnais 3–0, which ended their 2007–08 UEFA Champions League run. But the adventure continued as they progressed to the final of the UEFA Cup, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way. They beat Italian side Fiorentina on penalties to set up a final, in Manchester, against Zenit St. Petersburg, who are managed by former Gers manager Dick Advocaat. The team lost that match 2–0, amid serious disturbances caused by small sections of the 100,000-strong Rangers support. Video evidence was released by the Greater Manchester Police of suspected Rangers fans attacking officers in Manchester city centre following the defeat. An appeal was launched on BBC's Crimewatch program in January 2009 in an attempt to trace 49 men in connection with the riots. On the domestic front, the race for the Scottish Premier League continued until the final match-day of the season. Both Celtic and Rangers were tied on 86 points going into their games (against Dundee United and Aberdeen respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal difference of 57, four ahead of Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2–0 defeat away to the Dons. The club had had a ten-point lead in late March. The club appeared in its first final since 2005. They played Dundee United on 16 March 2008 and won the League Cup on penalties. The match was tied 2–2 after extra time, with both goals coming from Kris Boyd who also scored the winning spot kick. They also reached the 2009 Scottish Cup Final, the club's 50th appearance in a Scottish Cup final. The side had beaten St. Johnstone 4–3 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1–1 after extra time. The final was against Queen of the South and played on 24 May 2008. Rangers won the match 3–2 thanks to goals from DaMarcus Beasley and a double from Kris Boyd. The 2008–09 season began disastrously as the club exited the UEFA Champions League and European football altogether, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas in the second qualifying round. The first leg at Ibrox finished goalless, but the return leg ended in defeat for Rangers after an 87th-minute header from Linas Pilibaitis. The financial consequences of the failures to qualify for the Champions League were revealed when the club posted a loss of £3.9 million for the six months to December 2008, and in March decided to offer staff the option of voluntary redundancy as a way of cutting costs. There was also mounting pressure on the manager to reduce the first team squad from 28 players to a more manageable figure. The player excess was eased slightly with the departures of Chris Burke, Jean-Claude Darcheville and a couple out on loan deals but the increased debt meant that the club needed to find a cash injection. This resulted in the attempted sale of Kris Boyd to Birmingham City, which fell through due to the player's wage demands. In the first Old Firm game of the season, Rangers won 4–2, with Pedro Mendes scoring his first goal for the club, and Kenny Miller scoring a double against his former employers. But the team's league form stuttered thereafter. Despite a run of five wins from six matches following the Old Firm victory, the side trailed Celtic by seven points in the league at the turn of the year. For the first few months of 2009' both sides dropped and gained points on the other and Rangers briefly took over top spot of the Scottish Premier League on 21 February after a win against Kilmarnock. The spell as league leaders lasted less than a fortnight. A defeat and a draw, both at home, to Inverness and Hearts respectively, saw Smith's side sit second in the table, one point behind Celtic, at the split. The fourth Old Firm league meeting of the season finished with a 1–0 win to Rangers, thanks to a Steven Davis strike. This meant that, with three league games remaining, Rangers were two points ahead of Celtic. Further twists and turns followed, both Old Firm sides drew their matches against Hibernian at Easter Road, and so Rangers were ahead by two points with one round of matches remaining. Smith's side just needed a win against Dundee United to guarantee the club's 52nd league title. That is exactly what they got, goals from Kyle Lafferty, Pedro Mendes and Kris Boyd sealed a 3–0 win and the clubs first league championship in four seasons. The club played in the finals of both of the domestic cup competitions for the second season running. The 2009 Scottish League Cup Final was reached by defeating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Falkirk en route but the final ended in a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Old Firm rivals Celtic after extra time. The match was Walter Smith's first ever Old Firm final and was marred by a Kirk Broadfoot sending off deep into extra time for a foul on Aiden McGeady inside the penalty box. Celtic were subsequently awarded a penalty which McGeady himself converted. Rangers qualified for the 2009 Scottish Cup Final after beating St. Mirren 3–0 in the semi-final. The second goal of the game was scored by Kris Boyd and was his 100th goal for Rangers. The team faced Falkirk at Hampden Park on 30 May 2009 in what was the clubs 51st Scottish Cup Final appearance. A Nacho Novo strike in the first minute of the second half gave Rangers a 1–0 win and completed the domestic double. The following season saw Rangers financial problems continue. A quiet summer in terms of transfer arrivals contrasted to the outgoings. The club removed eleven players who had made first team appearances from the wage bill on permanent and loan deals. The only addition to the playing staff was Jérôme Rothen on a season loan, Rothen was the first player to sign for the club in over a year. On 26 August, chairman David Murray stepped down and was replaced by non-executive director Alastair Johnston. Johnston stated that one of his main priorities was to find a buyer for owner Murray's shares. On 24 October, Rangers manager Walter Smith was reported to say that Lloyds Banking Group, who the club was in debt to, was ""effectively running the club"". On 12 November, the extent of the clubs financial problems was shown to be £31 million in debt, a rise of £10m from the previous year. On the field, Rangers' Scottish Premier League title defence got off to a stuttering start, three wins in the league was followed by three draws, the first Old Firm victory of the season was followed by poor performances against St. Johnstone and dropped points at home to Hibernian. The side lost their first league match of the season away to Aberdeen on 28 November but then embarked on a six match winning run, scoring 26 goals in the process. At the start of 2010, Rangers sat at the top of the league. The second Old Firm fixture finished in a 1–1 draw. Rangers had a ten-point lead by mid-February. Rangers won the third Old Firm match 1–0 thanks to an injury time winner from Maurice Edu which all but secured the title. The side had to wait nearly two months to be confirmed as champions due to dropping points to St. Johnstone and Dundee United. On 25 April, Rangers won their 53rd league title after defeating Hibernian 1–0 at Easter Road. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after a 1–0 victory over St. Mirren in the final, despite being reduced to nine men with Danny Wilson and Kevin Thomson being sent off. However, Rangers were unable to retain the Scottish Cup after losing 1–0 to eventual winners Dundee United in a quarter-final replay. Rangers were seeded in pot two of the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time. The club was drawn against Spanish team Sevilla, German outfit Stuttgart and Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. A 1–1 away draw in Germany was followed by two consecutive 4–1 defeats at home to Sevilla and Unirea, the latter being regarded as one of the club's worst-ever European results. Rangers were left with a small chance of qualifying from the group after a 1–1 draw in the return leg with Unirea, a match that saw trouble in the Rangers fans section of the stadium. The club was charged by UEFA for inappropriate conduct and following an investigation fined €20,000 plus ordered to pay the cost of repairing the damage to the stadium infrastructure caused by its supporters. The side finished bottom of their group and was knocked out of European football altogether after two defeats from in the final two matches. With financial problems at the club ongoing, the summer of 2010 began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad. Smith had to decided whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven, he opted for quality. Both sides of the Old Firm began the season with eight league wins in a row, however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3-1 victory over Celtic and took early control of the league. A 1-1 draw at home to Inverness CT the following weekend ended Rangers 100% start to the season and a home defeat to Hibernian inflicted the teams first league defeat of the season, the first of five. The cold spell in the winter of 2010-11 saw many postponements and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic but with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the Old Firm, Celtic came out on top and mathematical lead the table, for the first time that season. However Celtic's advantage was short lived after a loss to Motherwell the following week. This allowed Rangers to regain top spot, but 3-2 loss to Dundee United at Ibrox followed by a 0-0 draw in the final Old Firm fixture left the title in Celtic's hands, with just four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season; on 3 May, Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness and so with three matches remaining Rangers had a one-point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring 11 goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after beating Celtic 2-1 AET. However, Rangers lost 1-0 to Celtic in the fifth round replay in Scottish Cup. The match was marked by several incidents, three Rangers players were sent off and Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist were involved in a bust-up. In Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages for the second season in a row. They drew Manchester United, Valencia and Bursaspor. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford, a 1-0 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia. A 3-0 defeat in Spain to Valencia followed by a 1-0 loss at home to Manchester United ended Rangers chances of qualifying for the last 16, but third place and a spot in the UEFA Europa League was already secured with Bursaspor having failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match, Rangers drew 1-1 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. However, Rangers did make it to the last 16 of the Europa League, beating Sporting Lisbon on away goals in the last 32 but lost to PSV Eindhoven on aggregate. On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) for £1 to Wavetower Limited, a company ultimately owned by businessman Craig Whyte. Ally McCoist and Insolvency. Smith's deputy and Rangers record goalscorer Ally McCoist was appointed manager of the club for season 2011-12. Hampered by a bizarre transfer policy under Whyte, Rangers found themselves knocked out of first the UEFA Champions League and then the UEFA Europa League by the end of August, depriving the club of income that may have been anticipated. With the new ownership there initially appeared to be some financial stability of the club. A number of first-team regulars were secured on long-term contract extensions including Steven Davis, Allan McGregor, Steven Whittaker and Gregg Wylde. When McCoist entered the transfer market, his first signing being Almería midfielder Juan Manuel Ortiz, he soon encountered difficulties. A number of highly publicised failed transfers, including deals for Wesley Verhoek and Roland Juhász, lead to many doubting Whyte’s financial prowess. Rangers' first Scottish Premier League match of the season was a home match against Jim Jefferies' Hearts, where the league flag was unfurled by then chairman Craig Whyte, as Rangers were under considerable pressure for most of the first half but managed to salvage a draw. The following week, McCoist claimed his first competitive victory as manager with a win over St. Johnstone. The season proved to be a baptism of fire for McCoist, by early October the club held a ten-point lead over Celtic, and on 5 November the lead stood at fifteen points over Celtic and twelve over second placed Motherwell. However, a draw with St. Johnstone and subsequent defeats to Kilmarnock, St. Mirren and Old Firm rivals Celtic, who then went on a run of twenty-one matches undefeated saw Rangers slip to second place where the club remained for the rest of the season. Rangers' European adventure began in the middle of the final week of July, where Rangers were defeated by underdogs Malmö 1-0 at home and Rangers crashed out of the Champions League with a bad tempered 1-1 draw in Sweden in which both Steven Whittaker and Madjid Bougherra were both given their marching orders, and ultimately relegating the Gers to the Europa League play-off round, where they faced Slovenian team NK Maribor. In cup competitions the club fared no better, a third round defeat to First Division side Falkirk in the League Cup and a fifth round exit at home to Dundee United. On 13 February 2012, Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of their intention to appoint administrators. Rangers officially entered administration on the following day, appointing London-based financial advisers Duff & Phelps as administrators. Rangers entered administration over an alleged non-payment of £9m in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs. On entering administration, the team was deducted ten-points by the SPL, a move regarded as 'effectively ending' its 2012 championship challenge. A failure then to submit accounts for 2011 meant the club was not granted a licence to play in European football in season 2012–13. In April it was revealed that the club's total debts could be as high as £134m. On 13 May it was revealed that Whyte sold his controlling interest in The Rangers Football Club Plc for £2 to a consortium led by Charles Green. Green offered the creditors a settlement, in the fom of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in an attempt to exit administration. On 12 June 2012, it emerged that HMRC would reject the CVA put forward by Green. Green's takeover of the club depended on the CVA being accepted by HMRC, which would have seen £8.5m of the total debt repaid. The formal rejection of the CVA, two days later, meant that The Rangers Football Club plc entered the liquidation process. The company's business and assets (including its History and silverware) were sold to a company called Sevco Scotland Ltd, a consortium led by Green, in a deal worth £5.5m. Sevco was subsequently renamed The Rangers Football Club Ltd at the end of July 2012. Ten of the other eleven SPL clubs voted against allowing Rangers to transfer their SPL membership share to a new company on 4 July 2012, leaving the club applying for a place in the Scottish Football League. On 13 July, 25 out of 30 SFL member clubs voted to place Rangers FC into the Third Division of the Irn-Bru Scottish Football League from the start of the season. Rangers clinched the Scottish Third Division Title on 30 March after a goalless draw away to Montrose and Queen's Park lost. Rangers are promoted to the Scottish Second Division next season. "
wikipedia-3913050," Wojtek Wolski  Wojtek Wolski (pronounced: ""VOY-tek VOL-skee""; born February 24, 1986) is a Polish-Canadian professional ice hockey left winger currently playing for the Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). In the NHL, he has played for the Colorado Avalanche, Phoenix Coyotes, New York Rangers, Florida Panthers, and the Washington Capitals. During the 2012 NHL lockout, he played for KH Sanok in the PLH, the top-tier hockey league in Poland. While he holds dual citizenship, Wolski is a product of the Canadian training system and is currently ineligible to represent Poland internationally. Playing career. Junior. Wolski was drafted in the first round, 21st overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Colorado Avalanche. It was originally believed that he would be the 10th-15th pick, but some teams passed on him because he was charged with assault causing bodily harm by Toronto police shortly before the draft. Wolski allegedly beat and hospitalized another young man his age at a birthday party. The case was dismissed when it was learned that Wolski was defending his girlfriend, who had been pushed off a porch.  Prior to being drafted, Wolski attended St. Michael's College School and played for the Buzzers hockey team in 2001–02. Before making the Avalanche roster, he recorded 14 franchise records as a member of the OHL's Brampton Battalion, and earned the award for Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2006. Wolski was the OHL Player of the Month an unprecedented four months in a row (December, January, February, and March). He was also an Alternate captain for Ontario's Under-17 team at the 2003 Canada Winter Games. Wolski suited up for Team Canada in the 2004 Canada/Russia Series and was voted Player of the Game (Team Cherry) for 2004 CHL Top Prospects Game. Professional. Wolski made his Avalanche debut in the 2006 playoffs and marked a sensational debut with three points (one goal, two assists). In his first full professional season, Wolski played in the NHL YoungStars Game on January 23, 2007, a part of the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game festivities held in Dallas. He recorded two points (two assists) for the Western Conference. In the 2008-09 season, Wolski demonstrated his scoring talent in shootouts. At season's end, he would score 10 times out of 12 attempts, establishing a single season record in percentage of shootout goals scored. His 14 goals and 28 assists would be good enough to finish third on the Avs with 42 points, behind Milan Hejduk and Ryan Smyth. On March 3, 2010, Wolski was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes for Peter Mueller and Kevin Porter. In his first game with the Coyotes, he scored the game-winning goal against his former team, the Avalanche, with just 22 seconds left in the 3rd period. Three days later, in his second game with the Coyotes, he scored again in a 4-0 win against the Anaheim Ducks. On June 28, 2010, Wolski resigned a two-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. Since joining Phoenix, he switched from the number 8 he wore in Colorado (already in use by Scottie Upshall) to number 86, becoming the second NHL player to wear that number (Jonathan Ferland played 7 games for Montreal in 2006 wearing number 86). In the 2010-11 season, Wolski failed to recapture his scoring pace from after last years trade from Colorado. With a steadily diminished role with the Coyotes he was traded for the second time within a year to the New York Rangers for Michal Rozsival on January 10, 2011. Wolski also failed to click with the Rangers, building a reputation as a player who ""would rather not play in tough areas to score"", he was a healthy scratch on more than one occasion. On February 25, 2012, Wolski was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a Michael Vernace and a third round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Wolski joined his fifth team in just over two years when he signed a one-year $600,000 free agent deal with the Washington Capitals for the 2012-13 season on July 11, 2012. During the 2012 NHL lockout, Wolski joined KH Sanok, the top team at the time in the PLH, the top-tier hockey league in Poland. He rejoined the Washington Capitals at the start of the NHL season. Personal. Wolski left Poland with his parents and older brother Kordian in 1989. Two years later, by way of West Germany, they finally landed in Toronto, Ontario. He learned how to skate at a local outdoor skating rink in Etobicoke using his brother's skates, which were a few sizes too big. In order to make them fit, he would wear three pairs of socks and stuff the front of the boot with newspapers. The first NHL game he attended as a young boy was the Colorado Avalanche versus the Toronto Maple Leafs at Maple Leaf Gardens. He followed the Avalanche as his favorite team ever since then, and grew to idolize future teammate Joe Sakic before coincidentally being drafted by Colorado himself. During 2006-2007 Wolski dated Canadian actress Ashley Leggat while playing for the Avalanche. "
wikipedia-3913136," Conjugated protein  A conjugated protein is a protein that functions in interaction with other chemical groups attached by covalent bonds or by weak interactions. Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The nonamino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups. Some examples of conjugated proteins are lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, hemoproteins, flavoproteins, metalloproteins, phytochromes, cytochromes and opsins. Hemoglobin contains the prosthetic group containing iron, which is the heme. It is within the heme group that carries the oxygen molecule through the binding of the oxygen molecule to the iron ion (Fe2+) found in the heme group.  Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes. References. Nelson DL, Cox MM (2005).

wikipedia-3913176," Victor Kiam  Victor K. Kiam (7 December 1926 – 27 May 2001) was an American entrepreneur and the owner of the New England Patriots football team from 1988–1991. Biography. After attending Yale, the Sorbonne and Harvard Business School, Kiam worked for Lever Brothers and Playtex as a salesperson. He first made his fortune as the President and CEO of Remington Products, which he famously purchased after his wife bought him his first electric shaver. In 1994, Victor Kiam sold a controlling interest in Remington Products to Isaac Perlmutter. Kiam also operated two other companies: Ronson and TravelSmart. Kiam also bought the Benrus Watch Company in 1968, selling his majority stake in 1977. Kiam became famous as the spokesperson for the Remington shaver. Kiam's famous catchphrase, ""I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company"", made him a household name. He recorded each advertisement in the native language for the country in which it was broadcast. In the UK he became a celebrity appearing on TV chat shows including 'Wogan', 'The Tube' and David Frost's 'Through the Keyhole'.  In 1988, Kiam bought the NFL's New England Patriots for $84 million from founder Billy Sullivan. The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a ""Boston Herald"" reporter sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions. ""I can't disagree with the players' actions,"" he said, and claimed that the Herald ""asked for trouble"" by assigning a female reporter to cover the Patriots. He made headlines when he reportedly described Olson as a ""classic bitch."" The case was reportedly settled for approximately $250,000, Kiam took out a full-page ad in the Herald to apologize, and three players were fined. Despite his apology, he drew audience groans six months later when he spoke at an athletics banquet and asked, ""Do you know what Lisa Olson has in common with the Iraqis? They've both seen Patriot missiles up close.""  By 1992 Kiam was facing bankruptcy. He was in considerable debt to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein, and was forced to sell his 51 percent stake in the Patriots to him in part to service the debt. Orthwein would eventually sell that stake to Kraft only two years later after an aborted attempt to move the Patriots to St. Louis. Death. Kiam resided in Stamford, Connecticut at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, and three children, Lisa Durkin, Victor ""Tory"" Kiam III, and Robin Kiam Aviv, and seven grandchildren, Jenny, Alexander, Sophia, Lia, Caleigh, Nikki, and Blake. Upon Kiam's death ""The Times"" quoted one of his closest business associates in later years, Jonathon Lyons, as saying that he was ""a truly remarkable entrepreneur of the old kind – the kind they simply don't make any more."" Bibliography. Kiam wrote the following books about business and entrepreneurship: "
wikipedia-3913362," Gresham's School  Gresham’s School is an independent coeducational boarding school in Holt in North Norfolk, England. The school was founded in 1555 by Sir John Gresham as a free grammar school for forty boys, following King Henry VIII's dissolution of the Augustinian priory at Beeston Regis. The founder left the school's endowments in the hands of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of the City of London, who are still the school's trustees. In the 1890s, an increase in the rental income of property in the City of London led to a major expansion of the school, which built many new buildings on land it owned on the eastern edge of Holt, including several new boarding houses as well as new teaching buildings, library, and chapel. Gresham's began to admit girls in the mid-1970s and is now fully co-educational. As well as its senior school, it operates a preparatory and a Pre-Prep school, the latter now in the Old School House, the original senior school. Altogether, the three schools teach about eight hundred children. History. The School. Gresham's School at Holt was founded by Sir John Gresham by letters patent of 1555, during the reign of Queen Mary I. For its home he gave the school his manor house at Holt, which he had bought in 1546 from his elder brother Sir William Gresham. The founding of Gresham's was connected to King Henry VIII's suppression of the Priory of Augustinian canons at Beeston Regis in June 1539. The priory, established in 1216, had operated a school which John Gresham and his brothers probably attended, but the school came to an end with the priory, leaving no provision for education in the vicinity of Holt. The new school opened and was granted a Royal Charter in 1562. By the letters patent of 1555, the school was called in full 'The Free Grammar School of Sir John Gresham, knight, citizen and alderman of London'. The founder endowed Gresham's generously, placing its property in trust with the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of London, and full estate records dating from the school's foundation are held at the Guildhall Library. Sir John Gresham's endowments included his freehold property in Holt and Letheringsett, his wood and land called Prior's Grove, his manors of Pereers and Holt Hales, ""with all and singular to the same belonging, situate in Holt, Sherington, Letheringsett, Bodham, Kellinge, Wayborne, Semlingham, Stodrye, Bantrye, and West Wickham, in the said county of Norfolk"", and also tenements called 'The White Hind' and 'The Peacock' in the parish of St Giles's Without, Cripplegate, in the City of London. Close links with the Fishmongers' Company continue to this day. By his Will of 1601, Leonard Smith, a fishmonger of London, left £120 and all his goods to establish a fellowship at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and in 1604 'Mr Smith's Fellowship' was confirmed by the College, with the provision that ""scholars from the Grammar School of Holt, in Norfolk"" were to have preference. The School Library contains the Foundation Library, a collection of books and manuscripts provided at the school's establishment in 1555 and later. On Christmas Day 1650, the Reverend Thomas Cooper, MA, a former usher of Gresham's, was hanged for his part in a Royalist rebellion on behalf of Charles II. His body was left hanging on a gibbet in Holt's Market Place. For three hundred and fifty years, the School was based in what is now called the Old School House, or ""OSH"", the former manor house of Holt overlooking the Market Place in the town centre. In 1708, the school escaped a major fire which destroyed most of the rest of the mediaeval town of Holt. This resulted in most of the buildings now to be seen in the town centre belonging to the eighteenth century. In 1729, the Fishmongers' Company presented the school with ""...a valuable and useful library, not only of the best editions of the Classics and Lexicographers, but also with some books of Antiquities, Chronology, and Geography, together with a suitable pair of globes"". By the eighteenth century, references to fish were hard to find in the court minutes of the Fishmongers' Company, and the company's main business had become managing its extensive property and administering its charities and trusts, such as the school at Holt and St Peter's Hospital, an almshouse at Newington in Surrey. For the period 1704 to 1750, the Rev. Charles Linnell has analysed the 'Status of fathers of boys at Holt Grammar School' in his ""Gresham's School History and Register"" (1955): ""Sons of gentlemen 10%, clergy 30%, professional men 5%, tradesmen 20%, plebeian 15%, unknown 20%"". One of the school's 18th century heads was John Holmes, appointed at the age of twenty-seven, a prolific writer of educational textbooks who led the school between 1730 and his death in 1760. In the 19th century, boys were strictly required to attend services at the Holt parish church, and in November 1815 a boy called Charles Loynes was ""expelled for non-attendance at church"". In 1823, the expenditure of the Fishmongers' Company on the school was £367, of which £158 10s was for the Master's salary, allowances and gratuities, £80 for the Usher's salary, board and lodging, £52 11s 6d for repairs, £22 12s 6d for taxes, £15 15s 6d for poor rates, £12 10s for coals, £9 13s 4d for two-thirds of the cost of the school books, and £6 6s for a School Feast which took place in June. In 1836, 'The Wardens and Commonalty of the Art and Mystery of Fishmongers of the City of London' held an insurance policy for 'Other property or occupiers: Free Grammar School Holt Norfolk (Rev Benn. Pulleyn)' with the Sun Fire Office. In his ""History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of London"" (1836), William Herbert says of the school: Herbert also notes that the officers of the court of the Fishmongers' Company include ""a steward of the Holt free school, in Norfolk"". John William Burgon, in ""The Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham"" (1839), after listing the estates with which Sir John Gresham endowed the school, says  Burgon goes on, however, to add  The Old School was rebuilt and converted in 1859. In 1880, a Commission was appointed to enquire into the City of London Livery Companies. When it published its first reports in 1881 the following formed part of a 'Supplementary Statement on behalf of the Fishmongers' Company' included in Volume 1: In the early 1900s, under an ambitious headmaster called George Howson (who had moved to Gresham's from Uppingham), the school expanded onto a new campus of some at the eastern edge of the town, while keeping the Old School House as one of its houses. When Howson arrived at Gresham's, he found it in numbers much as it had been when founded in 1555: in 1900 there were only forty ""Holt Scholars"", plus seven boarders. The New School (by the architect Sir John Simpson) was opened by Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood on 30 September 1903. This consisted of School House (renamed Howson's in 1919) and the Main Building, including Big School. Woodlands was acquired and opened as a new house in 1905, the school's first swimming pool was opened in 1907, and Farfield was built in 1911. The School Chapel was completed in 1916, during the Great War, during which one hundred Old Greshamians were killed. Gresham's was one of the first schools in England to abolish corporal punishment. In March 1921 the school's headmaster, J. R. Eccles, commenting to ""The Times"", ""condemned corporal punishment of any kind"". The Thatched Buildings, the gift of the headmaster, were opened by Sir Arthur Shipley in February 1921. In 1923, Sir Harry Brittain asked Edward Wood, President of the Board of Education in the House of Commons ""whether he will explain why Gresham's school, Holt, was admitted to the benefits of the Superannuation Act although it is an endowed school, owning all its buildings and supported by a wealthy city company?"" A new school library, designed by the architect Alan E. Munby, was opened in 1931 by Field Marshal Lord Milne. In the 1930s, there were three categories of scholarship in the senior school: Holt ""A"" scholarships gave complete exemption from fees, County Scholarships were worth £100 a year, and Fishmongers' Company Open Scholarships were worth £50 a year. The school was evacuated to Newquay in Cornwall during the Second World War, between June 1940 and March 1944. Martin Burgess's memories of Gresham's during the freezing months of January to March 1947, the coldest British winter on record, are quoted at length in ""I Will Plant Me a Tree"" (2002). Not only was the winter icy cold, but because of fuel shortages the school was unheated. Burgess recalls that ""Periods were held in full overcoats and scarves and gloves. If it happened now the School would be closed, but such a step was not even thought of then. In any case, the roads were blocked... One day the School was called out to dig out a farm, or was it a small village? Hurrah! No periods! In the afternoon everyone prayed there would be periods, it was so cold. A man had died."" Under the long headship of Logie Bruce Lockhart (1955–1982), there was a further period of change and expansion. Kenwyn, a new Junior School House, was built and opened in 1958. The bridge over the Cromer Road was opened in 1962, and was initiated after the tragic death of Kirsty, LBL's daughter, while crossing Cromer Road in front of Howson's. Tallis, a new boys' house named after John Tallis, Master of the school for more than thirty years in the first half of the seventeenth century, was built and opened in 1963 as were the biology classrooms and music rooms. Oakeley became the first girls' house in 1971, when girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form only. The school became fully co-educational in the 1970s. There are now four boarding houses for boys and three for girls (see ""Houses"" section below), as well as a wide range of buildings. These include Big School, the School Chapel, the Auden Theatre, the Cairns Centre, the School Library, the Music Centre, the Central Block, the Thatched Classrooms, the Reith Laboratories, the Biology Building, the Armoury, and others. In February 2005, Gresham's School's 450th anniversary was marked by a service at Norwich Cathedral attended by the school's Patron, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and 1,500 past and present Greshamians. In July 2005, the Eastern Daily Press called it """"a school which changed the world."""" When Philip John, formerly head of King William's College, arrived to take over the head mastership in September 2008, the ""Tatler Schools Guide"" commented ""It will be interesting to observe the impact of mathematician Philip John.""

OG groups include the main OG Club, open to all former pupils, which publishes a magazine and has almost four thousand members; the OG Golf Society, the OG Cricket Team, the OG Rifle Establishment (OGRE) which has its own residence at Bisley, and the OG Masonic Lodge. The Lodge was formed in January 1939. Houses. Most Gresham's students are boarders and live in one of the school's seven houses. Four of these are for boys: Howson's (1903), Woodlands (1905), Farfield (1911), and Tallis (1961). Three houses are for girls: Oakeley (1971), Edinburgh (1984), and Britten (1992). Edinburgh was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the school's Patron, after whom it is named. Britten is an extension of the former school Sanatorium. Each house has a house-master or house-mistress and a house-tutor and matron. There are house teams for team sports, as well as other house activities, such as evening prayers, ""prep"", and dramatic productions. Most houses are around seventy strong. Senior boys and girls may be appointed as house prefects. Some of those are then chosen as school prefects, and one in each house as House Captain. The Old School House was previously the whole school, then from 1905 to 1936 the Junior House, then from 1936 to 1993 a boarding house of the Senior School and is now the home of the Gresham's pre-preparatory school. Junior Schools. The former Junior School of Gresham's was reorganized into a Preparatory School and a Pre-Preparatory School in 1984, both on their own sites at Holt, with their own heads and staff. Like the Senior School, both are fully co-educational. The Preparatory school has over two hundred children between the ages of eight and thirteen and takes full and weekly boarders as well as day pupils. Many continue into the Senior School. The school's Kenwyn House was once a house of the Senior School called Bengal Lodge. The Pre-Preparatory School is housed in the Old School House and is a day school for one hundred boys and girls between the ages of three and eight. Admission to the school. In most cases, admission to the senior school of Gresham's depends on success at the Common Entrance Examination, usually taken between the ages of eleven and thirteen. Common Entrance has three compulsory core subjects, English, Maths and Science, and other papers can be chosen from French, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Geography, History, and Religious Studies. The school also has its own entrance examination for candidates from maintained schools. Curriculum. The school teaches most subjects of the mainstream humanistic curriculum. While only limited choices between courses need to be made for GCSE, in the Sixth form at A-level pupils choose three or four subjects, and most combinations are possible. The school has been an International Baccalaureate World School (IB code 003433), offering the IB Diploma Programme, since February 2007. The aim of the school is to give a good all-round education and to prepare pupils for university entry and for other careers, such as the armed forces. Most Greshamians move on to top British universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick, St Andrews, Bristol, Durham, York and Edinburgh. School terms. The school's year is divided into three terms, Michaelmas (early September to mid December), Lent (early January to the Easter holiday) and Summer (the Easter holiday to mid July). In the middle of each term there is a half-term holiday, usually a week long. For boarders, there are also other ""home weekends"". The academic year begins with the Michaelmas term and ends with the Summer term, so starts at the end of the summer holiday. Discipline. Misbehaving students are given punishments ranging from RLP (Red lined paper, generally copying out of a textbook), EP (Extra Period, happening at lunchtimes on Mondays and Fridays) to permanent exclusion. School sports. Apart from its sports grounds for cricket, rugby football, hockey, and soccer, the school has its own indoor swimming pool, squash, tennis and badminton courts, gymnasium and extensive school woods. It owns a boat-house at Barton Broad and a shooting lodge at Bisley, as well as a shooting range at the school. The principal school sports for boys are rugby (Michaelmas Term), hockey (Lent Term), and cricket (Summer Term). There is a wide range of other school sports, including tennis, badminton, soccer, squash, golf, martial arts, swimming, riding, sailing, cross-country running, shooting and canoeing. As an alternative to formal sports, Gresham's students may take part in 'School Works', chiefly forestry activities in the woodland attached to the main school campus. An Old Greshamian, Richard Leman, was a member of the gold-medal winning British hockey squad at the 1988 Summer Olympics and of the bronze-medal winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Another OG, Gawain Briars, was the British number one squash player and now heads the world Professional Squash Association. Brother and sister Ralph and Natasha Firman are both racing drivers, and Natasha was the winner of the inaugural Formula Woman championship in 2004. Giles Baring and Andrew Corran were first-class cricketers, while international rugby footballers include Andy Mulligan (Ireland and the British and Irish Lions, Nick Youngs (England and his sons Ben and Tom (England) both also playing for the British and Irish Lions winning team in Australia in 2013). In rifle-shooting, Gresham's has been one of the top ten schools in England for about sixty years, and Glyn Barnett won a shooting Gold Medal in the 2006 Commonwealth Games at Melbourne. In the field of winter sports, the 11th Earl of Northesk took an Olympic medal for toboganning (then called 'skeleton') in 1928. Notable mountaineers have included Tom Bourdillon, Percy Wyn-Harris, Peter Lloyd and Matthew Dickinson. Religion. Gresham's is a Church of England foundation, but the school is open to all denominations and religions. Services are a focal point of the School's life, with a morning assembly in Chapel on four mornings of the week. Pupils not in the Sixth form have an extra morning in chapel, whilst the sixth form have another tutor period (Thursday morning). All years have a tutor period on Wednesday. The Saturday morning service is a choral practice, and Holy Communion may be taken on Sundays. There are also formal prayers in most boarding houses in the evenings. Non-Anglicans are excused communion services on Sundays, and Roman Catholics attend mass on Sunday at the church of Our Lady and St Joseph in Sheringham. If wished, boys and girls may be prepared at the School for Confirmation into the Church of England, which is usually conducted by the Bishop of Norwich or one of his suffragan Bishops. The school was designated as having a Church of England religious character by the Designation of Schools Having a Religious Character (Independent Schools) (England) Order 2004 (No 72). The tune called ""Woodlands"", the usual setting for the hymn Lift Up Your Hearts!, was composed for the school in 1916 by Walter Greatorex, a Gresham's master, who succeeded another composer, Geoffrey Shaw, as the school's Director of Music. A new school chapel, by the Scottish architect Maxwell Ayrton, was built between 1912 and 1916, and is now a listed building. The foundation stone of the chapel was laid by the chairman of governors, Sir Edward Busk, on 8 June 1912. The Chapel bell, cast in Whitechapel in 1915, is inscribed with the words ""Ring in the Christ that is to be, Donum Dedit J. R. E."". The last words stand for ""the gift of J. R. Eccles"" (at the time second master, later headmaster), while the first eight are the last line of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem ""Ring Out, Wild Bells"" (1850). The Gresham family motto, ""Fiat voluntas tua"" ('Thy will be done') appears on the chapel's main door. Old Greshamians include several bishops, David Hand, Archbishop of Papua New Guinea, and John Bradburne, a candidate for canonization. Out of school activities. There is a School Orchestra, a School Choir, a Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme (more than five hundred Gold Awards have been achieved since its inception in 1972), and a large number of school clubs, such as the Debating Society, the Natural History Society, the Sailing Club, the Kayak Club and the Chess Club. North Norfolk Divers, a branch of the British Sub-Aqua Club, is based at the school. A school play is produced at the end of every Summer Term, and each house also produces a play once a year. There are also many visits to concerts, plays and other outside events. In 1922, W. H. Auden played the Shrew in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and in 1925 he played Caliban in ""The Tempest"". Combined Cadet Force. Gresham's has a long military tradition, from Sir Christopher Heydon, who took part in the capture of Cádiz in 1596, to Tom Wintringham, commander of the British Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War, and General Sir Robert Bray, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Before the Second World War, the school had an Officers Training Corps. During the 1940s, OTCs in British schools were renamed 'Junior Training Corps', and the school's JTC was amalgamated into the Combined Cadet Force in April, 1948, which continues to provide military training. The CCF's Army section is now associated with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment (previously with the Royal Norfolk Regiment, to 1959, and the 1st East Anglian Regiment, 1959 to 1964) and has some 270 students as cadets. About another 130 are in the CCF's Air section, and training takes place on one afternoon of each week. Activities include shooting, expeditions, combat manoeuvres, ambush and continuity drills, signals training, orienteering, climbing, kayaking, line-laying, first aid and lifesaving, motor mechanics, and hovercraft construction. A Biennial Review of the Gresham's School CCF Contingent was carried out on 10 May 2006 by General Sir Richard Dannatt KCB CBE MC, Commander-in-Chief Land Command and Chief of the General Staff designate. Scholarships. Scholarships are available, giving a reduction in school fees. These include Open Academic Scholarships, Music, Art and Drama Scholarships, Lockhart Academic Scholarships, Edinburgh Scholarships, Fishmongers' Company Open Scholarships and Fishmongers' Art Scholarships, Sports Scholarships and All Rounder Scholarships. There is also an award called the 450th Anniversary Boarding Award. Examinations for Academic Scholarships are held every February for admission the following September, while Scholarships in Music, Sport, Art, and Drama are awarded on the basis of interviews and practical work. Sixth Form Scholarships for Sport, Music, Art, and academic distinction are awarded in December for the two years beginning the following September and are open to external and internal candidates. The maximum value of a Scholarship is half of the school's fees, but the value may be increased by a bursary in cases of financial need. Roughly one in four Gresham's pupils hold a scholarship, and about one in eight receive a bursary for financial need. Fees. The school's annual fees for the academic year 2013–14 are: In September 2005, Gresham's was one of the leading British schools (including Ampleforth, Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Bedford, Haileybury, Marlborough, Rugby, Shrewsbury, Stowe, Wellington and Winchester) which were considered by the Office of Fair Trading to be operating a fee-fixing cartel in breach of the Competition Act 1998. All of the schools were ordered to abandon the practice of exchanging information on their planned fees. Governing body. More than half of the school's Governing Body represent the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, who have been the school's trustees since 1555. The Chairman of Governors (currently Mr A.N.G. Duckworth-Chad, D.L., a Norfolk landowner) is always a past or present Prime Warden of the Fishmongers' Company. A previous Chairman was the late Admiral Earl Cairns, after whom the school's Cairns Centre is named. The present Prime Warden, Sir Richard Carew Pole, is also a governor. The governing body includes a representative of Cambridge University, currently Lady Perry of Southwark, and one of Norfolk County Council, and it also seeks to include some distinguished Old Greshamians. The Clerk of the Fishmongers' Company also acts as Clerk to the Governing Body, and its meetings are held at Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London. The Grasshopper. The Grasshopper is used as the badge of several Gresham's School clubs, and a long-established school periodical is called ""The Grasshopper"". The green insect appears as the crest above the school's coat of arms, commemorating the Founder, Sir John Gresham, whose family crest it was. The Gresham Grasshopper is also used by Gresham College and can be seen as the weathervane on the Royal Exchange in the City of London, founded in 1565 by Gresham's nephew Sir Thomas Gresham, and the similar weathervane on the Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts, which is modelled on the Royal Exchange's. The first Royal Exchange was profusely decorated with grasshoppers. According to an ancient legend of the Greshams, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby in long grass in North Norfolk in the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. A beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply an heraldic rebus on the name Gresham, with ""gres"" being a Middle English form of ""grass"" (Old English grœs). In the system of English heraldry, the grasshopper is said to represent wisdom and nobility. Development and external relations. During the celebrations of the school's 450th year in 2005, the establishment was announced of a Foundation to focus on encouraging legacies and donations for scholarships, bursaries and specific major projects. A Director of Development and External Relations has since been appointed, as part of a programme of reaching out to Old Greshamians, and gatherings are planned around the UK and overseas. Archives. The Manuscripts Section of the Guildhall Library in the City of London holds the following Gresham's School records: The Norfolk Record Office also holds some Gresham's accessions, including a bundle of correspondence relating to the school from 1799 to 1810 between the Fishmongers' Company and Adey & Repton, including copies of statutes.

wikipedia-3913403," DirectDraw Surface  The DirectDraw Surface file format (uses the filename extension DDS), from Microsoft, is a standard for storing data compressed with the lossy S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) algorithm, which can be decompressed in hardware by GPUs and consoles like the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This makes the format useful for storing graphical textures and cubic environment maps as a data file, both compressed and uncompressed. The Microsoft Windows file extension for this data format is '.dds'. History. This format was introduced with DirectX 7.0. In DirectX 8.0, support for volume textures was added. Though it was originally designed for DirectX, it can also be used in OpenGL as well via the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) ARB texture compression extension. With Direct3D 10, the file format was extended to allow an array of textures to be included, as well as support for new Direct3D 10.x and 11 texture formats. "
wikipedia-3913453," Pinealoma  Pinealoma is a tumor of the pineal gland. Presentation. The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin which plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms. A pinealoma may disrupt production of this hormone, and insomnia may result. Frequently, paralysis of upward gaze along with several ocular findings such as convergence retraction nystagmus and eyelid retraction also known as Collier's sign and Light Near Dissociation (pupil accommodates but doesn't react to light) are known collectively as Parinaud's syndrome or Dorsal Mid-brain syndrome, are the only physical symptoms seen. This is caused by the compression of the vertical gaze center in the midbrain tectum at the level of the superior colliculus and cranial nerve III. Work-up usually includes Neuro-imaging as seen on the right. A pinealoma may cause interruption of hypothalamic inhibiting pathways, sometimes leading to beta-hCG secretion and consequent Leydig's cell stimulation. Other symptoms may include hydrocephalus, gait disturbances, and precocious puberty. Etiology. Pinealomas can be due to proliferation of primary pineocytes (pineocytomas, pineoblastomas), astrocytes (astrocytoma), or germ cells (germinoma). Germinomas are the most common tumor in the pineal gland. Prognosis. Of the different types of pinealomas, the type with the most favorable prognosis is the pineocytoma. "
wikipedia-3913469," Kurdish culture  Kurdish Culture (Kurdish:کولتووری كوردی (Kulturi Kurdi) or ""çand û toreya kurdî"") is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. Some aspects of Kurdish culture are close to that of other Iranian peoples; for example all of them celebrate Newroz as the new year day, which is celebrated on March 21. Music. Traditionally, there are three types of Kurdish Classical performers - storytellers (""çîrokbêj""), minstrels (""stranbêj"") and bards (""dengbêj""). There was no specific music related to the Kurdish princely courts, and instead, music performed in night gatherings (""şevbihêrk"") is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs and are epic in nature, such as the popular Lawik's which are heroic ballads recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes of the past like Saladin. ""Heyran""s are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love. ""Lawje"" is a form of religious music and ""Payizok""s are songs performed specifically in autumn.  Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (""dîlok/narînk""), erotic poetry and work songs are also popular. Kurdish folklore is a very rich one. Kurds have their own national attire. The women usually wear colored dresses.These dresses differe from area to another area. One can tell from which province or city a certain lady is by looking at her dress. As to the men, they have the ""shalûshepik"" or ""rengûchox"" a sort of baggy trousers ""shirwal"" with an upper shirt. Round the belt they tie a long piece of cloth. The men also use ""shashik"" or ""cemedanî"" with a ""claw"" on their heads. Kurds love to dance and they have hundreds of folk-dances.The music usually have speedy tacts and high tuned. They mostly use the ""zurna"" (kind of flute) and ""Dehol"" (drum"". While kurds also enjoy melancholic maqams or ballads that usually tells about events from the past. Many historians use these ballads as oral history passed through the generations. Dance. Kurdish dance is a group of traditional hand-holding dances similar to those from the Balkans, Lebanon, and to Iraq. It is a form of round dancing, with a single or a couple of figure dancers often added to the geometrical centre of dancing circle.  According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, Kurds sing and dance in all of their festivals, birthdays and marriage ceremonies. These folkloric dances are one of the main factors in distinguishing Kurds from neighbouring Muslim populations. Kurdish dance has various and numerous versions such as following:  Rug. Kurdish rugs and carpets do use medallion patterns; however, far more popular are the all-over floral, Mina Khani motifs and the ""jaff"" geometric patterns. The beauty of Kurdish designs are enriched by high-chroma blues, greens, saffrons as well as terracotta and burnt orange hues made richer still by the lusturous wool used. The traditional Kurdish Rug uses Kurdish symbols. It is possible to read the dreams, wishes and hopes of the rug maker from the sequence of symbols used. It is this signification and communication both individually and grouped into Kurdish rug making Kurdish people study how meaning is constructed and understood by talking with the rug maker. Religion. Before the spread of Islam in the 7th century AD, the majority of Kurds practised their indigenous religions, which today are referred to as Yazdanism. Yazidism and Yarsan, which may have stemmed from and eventually replaced those religions, are still practiced among the Kurds. Most Yazidis live in Iraqi Kurdistan, in the vicinity of Mosul and Sinjar. Yazidis are also found in Syria, Armenia, Turkey, and Germany. Their holy book is ""Mishefa Reş"" (The Black Book). The Yarsan, or Ahl-e Haqq, religion is practised in western Iran, primarily around Kermanshah. There were also many Kurds who practised Zoroastrianism. Before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, a large part of the Kurdish population practised Christianity. Kurdish Christians can still be found in small numbers, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish kingdom of Adiabene, together with a large number of its Kurdish citizens, converted to Judaism during the 1st century BC. ""Tanna’it"" Asenath Barzani, who lived in Mosul from 1590 to 1670 was among the very first Jewish women to carry an official title normally reserved for rabbinic scholars. In the 7th century, Arabs conquered the Kurdish regions and converted the majority of Kurds to Islam. The majority of Kurds today are Muslim, belonging to the Shafi school of Sunni Islam, distinguishing them in the region, (and to a much lesser degree, the Hanafi) Schools of Sunni Islam. There is also a significant minority of Kurds that are Shia Muslims, primarily living in the Ilam and Kermanshah provinces of Iran and Central Iraq (""Al-Fayliah"" Kurds). The Alevis are another religious minority among the Kurds, mainly found in Turkey. There are also Kurdish Agnostics.  Most Kurds have moderate tendencies toward religion. Folklore. Some better known traditional Kurdish ceremonies or festivals include:  Legendary characters include:  Cultural heritage. Kurdish cultural heritage is rooted in one of the world's oldest cultures. In parts of Arbil, Southern Syria and Western Iran, the Kurdish young men practice an old culture in which growing a mustache and beard at a young age to prove their loyalty as a man and respect to their elders. Over the past century, this culture has disappeared in most of the area. The Kurds were formerly considered sufficient to describe themselves as the descendants of the Carduchi, who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains in the 4th century BC. However, there is evidence of more ancient settlements in the region of Kurdistan. The earliest known evidence of a unified and distinct culture (and possibly, ethnicity) by people inhabiting the Kurdish mountains dates back to the Halaf culture of 6000 BC to 5400 BC. This was followed by the spread of the Ubaidian culture, which was a foreign introduction from Mesopotamia. In 1927, Ephraim Speiser discovered remains of ancient Halaf and Ubaid settlements in ""Tepe Gewre"" (Great Mound) 24 km northeast of Mosul. These settlements date back to between the 5th and 2nd millennium B.C., and include 24 levels of civilizations including Halaf and Ubaid. This site includes an acropolis with monumental remains and fine architecture. In their own histories, they are proud to mention the Hurrian period in the mid third millennium BC as the earliest well documented period. The 3rd millennium was the time of the Guti and Hattians. The 2nd and 1st millennium BC were the time of the Kassites, Mitanni, Mannai (Mannaeans), Urartu, and Mushku. All of these peoples shared a common identity and spoke one language or closely related languages or dialects. These groups are thought to have been non-Indo-Europeans, apart from the original Mitanni leadership. Kurds consider themselves to be Indo-European as well as descendants of the above groups. According to the Encyclopedia Kurdistanica, Kurds are the descendants of all those who have historically settled in Kurdistan, not of any one particular group. A people such as the Guti (Kurti), Mede, Mard, Carduchi(Gordyaei), Adiabene, Zila and Khaldi signify not ""the"" ancestor of the Kurds but only one ancestor. This heritage has been subject to injustices, neglect and repression, or has been eclipsed by other cultures. Important components of the original cultural heritage have disappeared or have been destroyed. There are numerous examples of how valuable or irreplaceable Kurdish physical heritage are endangered or destroyed, like the threat posed by the Illusi Dam in Turkey, where the oldest Kurdish city, Hasankeyf, soon is to be covered by water.

wikipedia-3913669," Coat of arms of the Isle of Man  The coat of arms of the Isle of Man dates from 12 July 1996. As the Isle of Man is a Crown dependency, the arms are more accurately described as The Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the Isle of Man. History. The Arms of Her Majesty in right of the Isle of Man were granted by Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann on 12 July 1996. The arms are an augmented form of the traditional arms. It has a threefold rotational symmetry. ""See"" Frieze group. The traditional arms date back to the 13th century. The arms are recorded in the English ""Walford's Roll"", and ""Camden Roll"", as well as the French ""Wijbergen Roll"". Within the ""Camden Roll"" the arms appear illustrated as: ""gules, three mailed legs embowed, and conjoined at the thighs, argent""; the original Norman French blazon reads: """"l'escu de gules, a treis iambes armes"""". Symbolism. Escutcheon. The escutcheon is emblazoned: ""Gules a triskele argent garnished and spurred Or"". The triskele (or triskelion) is an ancient symbol, consisting of three branches or legs, that radiate from a centre. The symbol is found on the flag Isle of Man, and earlier on that of Sicily. The Manx triskelion is known in the Manx language as ""Ny Tree Cassyn"" (""The Three Legs""). The symbol has been associated with the island since at least the 13th century. It is unknown how the Manx triskelion was originally adopted, and several theories have been put forward its origin. In 1607, English historian William Camden stated that it was derived from the Sicilian triskelion. In 1885 John Newton considered the Manx triskelion originated in the mid 13th century, when the Pope offered the throne of Sicily to Edmund, son of King Henry III of England. Newton noted that the wife of King Alexander III of Scotland was Henry's daughter, and that Alexander visited the English court in 1255. Later in 1266, Norway ceded the Isle of Man to the Kingdom of Scotland, and Newton considered it likely that Alexander utilised the triskelion for the arms of his new possession. It has also been suggested that the ancestry of the Manx triskelion can be traced to the triquetra in a coin of Olaf Cuaran, a 10th-century Norse-Gaelic warlord who was king of Northumbria and king of Dublin. Lending credibility to this theory is the current belief that the mediaeval Manx dynasty was related to that of Olaf Cuaran. However, the gap between the 10th century and late 13th century, when the Manx triskelion is first recorded, is wide indeed, and it has been noted that several kings from this period are known to have borne a galley as their emblem, and not a triskelion. Early examples of the symbol are present in the Royal Arms ascribed to the King of Mann in several late 13th century armorials. The Manx triskelion also appears on the Manx Sword of State, which is popularly said to date to the time of King Olaf the Black (d. 1237), although recent analysis has shown it more likely dates to about the 15th century. Another example can be seen on a 14th-century stone cross in the churchyard of Maughold. Another is example is a late 14th-century seal of Sir William le Scrope, Lord of Mann, in which the Manx triskelion is depicted in plate armour, rather than mail. Early representations of the Manx triskelion show the legs running clockwise, and later representations show the legs running in both directions. Supporters. The peregrine falcon is derived from the time of King John I of Mann. In 1405, he was granted the Isle of Man, on condition he paid homage to King Henry IV of England, and gave two peregrine falcons to him and every future English king their Coronation Day. The descendants of John I ruled the Isle of Man until King George III of England assumed the Lordship. The presentation of falcons continued on, until the coronation of King George IV of England, in 1822. In keeping with the Viking history of the island, the raven featured in Norse mythology. The chief god Odin was accompanied by the two ravens Huginn and Muninn. Motto. The motto is ""quocunque jeceris stabit"", which is Latin and means: ""whichever way you throw, it will stand"". The motto dates to the 17th century, where it is first recorded as being present on Manx coinage dating to the year 1668. It is possible that the motto became associated to the Manx triskelion through these coins. "

wikipedia-3913836," Nokia N80  The Nokia N80 is a multimedia 3G smartphone made by Nokia with support for high-speed UMTS/WCDMA connections. Features include a 3.1-megapixel camera (interpolated from 2.0-megapixels) with built-in flash (on the back of the device), another camera (on the front) for videoconferencing, Wi-Fi (802.11g), Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), FM radio, Bluetooth 1.2, digital music player functionality, MiniSD memory card slot, and support for 3D Java games. Because of its memory card and relatively large screen, it can function as a portable media player. It uses the third edition of the Series 60 user interface (S60v3) and the Symbian operating system version 9.1. It is ""not"" backward compatible with software compiled for earlier versions of the Symbian operating system. The N80 is Nokia's first UPnP-compatible phone, allowing the transfer of media files to compatible devices over Wi-Fi. Versions. Bluetooth. Nokia originally announced the N80 as supporting Bluetooth 2.0, however it was released with Bluetooth 1.2. Therefore the N80 does not currently support stereo playback over Bluetooth. Internet Edition. The Nokia N80 Internet Edition was a second version of this handset with the same hardware as the normal N80. It has been released in Q4 of 2006 and is available in Patina Bronze or Pearl Black, and has the following additional software included. As of January 2007, the Pearl Black model was available for sale in the US for $499. Nokia have now announced that the new Internet Edition firmware is available for the 'classic' N80 by using Nokia Official Software Updater, downloadable from Nokia.com. Before the Internet Edition firmware was made available on the Nokia Software Updater, end users could update the N80 to the same specification as an N80 Internet Edition by flashing the N80 with the firmware from the N80 Internet Edition. This required the use of several hacked Nokia servicing software applications, including the Phoenix Service Software (or Nokia Software Update with Nemesis (by changing product code)). This method is of questionable legality in some jurisdictions, and may violate the terms of the phone's warranty. There are reports of the occasional failure of this method due to user error or for other unknown reasons, leaving the phone in an unusable state from which only a properly-equipped service center could recover it.

It is located on the boundary of the West Midlands and Worcestershire counties between the towns of Dudley and Kidderminster. The parish had a population of 4,283 in 2001, but the whole village had a population of perhaps 5,600, including the part in Clent parish. It is in Bromsgrove District. The parish of Hagley used to consist of Top Hagley, Lower Hagley and Blakedown. The main focus of the village was Top Hagley where Hagley Hall and the parish church of St. John The Baptist (with its origins in Anglo-Saxon times) reside, but with the arrival of the railway in 1852 and the building of a ""proper"" station and its iconic GWR footbridge (finished in 1884), Lower Hagley started to expanded. With the expansion of Lower Hagley (now known as West Hagley) the focus of the village started to move. This was recognised in 1906 with the building of a subsidiary parish church in Lower Hagley dedicated to St. Saviour, and today West Hagley contains the shopping area and the schools. The precise dividing line between the two areas is undefined and is therefore debatable. Nevertheless, both settlements lie within the parish of Hagley. Hagley is part of the West Midlands Urban Area as defined by the Office for National Statistics, and is joined to Stourbridge and the Black Country by the A491 and B4187; The village lies at the foot of the Clent Hills, and is served by its own railway station on the Kidderminster to Birmingham line. It is situated on the A456 Birmingham to Kidderminster road, which is known as the Hagley Road in Birmingham, because it was once administered by a turnpike trust, whose responsibilities ended at the former boundary of the parish (now in Blakedown). Despite having a population larger than some market towns (such as Tenbury Wells) and once having its own cattle market, Hagley lacks the essential characteristics of a market town. While it has a shopping street and many local services, it is a fundamentally unbalanced community economically, in that there is little local employment (other than in local services). However, unemployment is low, because of the ease of commuting to work. Accordingly Hagley is essentially a dormitory village. The population of Hagley greatly increased after the arrival of the railway in 1862, which enabled people to commute into Birmingham or the adjacent Black Country. Landmarks. Hagley is known for Significant events. The parish register of Hagley is the oldest in England. It dates from 1 December 1538, being the year in which registers were ordered to be kept in all parishes. Three tragic events during the late 20th century drew media attention to Hagley. Murder of a student. In 1983, Susan Renhard from West Hagley, a student at Manchester Polytechnic, was murdered while taking photos in the Peak District. Her body was discovered showing indications that she had fought violently to defend herself before being strangled. The murder made national headlines and Norman Hugh Smith, a 17 year old computer student, was found guilty of the crime and described by the judge a ""very wicked man"". Susan's father, a retired law lecturer, became heavily involved in two charities that seek to help relatives who have lost loved ones through homicide. Child murder. In January 1988, Stuart Gough, a 14-year-old newspaper delivery boy was found murdered some 20 miles away near Worcester. Serial paedophile Victor Miller later admitted murdering Stuart and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge said that he didn't know whether it would be safe ever to release him. An article in the Daily Telegraph listed Miller as one of 35 murderers that the Home Secretary had recently recommended never to be released from prison. School minibus crash. In November 1993 a serious collision occurred on the M40 motorway near Warwick, approximately 30 miles from Hagley, resulting in the deaths of twelve pupils and a teacher. Only two girls survived the accident that made national headlines and caused moves for new legislation to improve safety and driving standards for school vehicles. "

wikipedia-3914289," Harold Fowler McCormick  Harold Fowler McCormick (May 2, 1872 — October 16, 1941) was an American businessman. He was chairman of the board of International Harvester Company and a member of the McCormick family. Biography. Harold was born on May 2, 1872 to inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick (1809—1884) and Nancy Fowler (1835—1923). In 1895 he married Edith Rockefeller (1872—1932), the youngest daughter of philanthropists John Davison Rockefeller (1839—1937) and Laura Celestia ""Cettie"" Rockefeller (1839—1915). Harold and Edith had five children (the eldest two died young) before divorcing in 1921. He became the third inaugural trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was also a trustee of the Rockefeller-created University of Chicago. As an officer of the Aero Club of Illinois, founded February 10, 1910, McCormick became the third president in 1912, following Octave Chanute and James E. Plew. In 1914, McCormick, Plew, and Bion J. Arnold attempted to form a commuter airline which they announced would begin service in May, ""using seaplanes to ferry passengers between various North Shore suburbs and Grant Park and the South Shore Country Club. Lake Shore Airline, which had two seaplanes, was intended to be a profit-making venture charging a steep twenty-eight-dollar round-trip fare between Lake Forest and downtown Chicago on four daily scheduled circuits. However, Chicago's irregular weather, especially the crosswinds, made a shamble of schedules, and the airline disappeared before the end of the year."" After his divorce from Edith, Harold married opera singer Ganna Walska. They divorced in 1931. During the transition period between these two women, McCormick sought to fortify himself by undergoing an operation by Serge Voronoff, a surgeon who specialized in transplanting animal glands into aging men with impotency. He resided at 1000 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Harold became chairman of the board of International Harvester Company in 1935, replacing his older brother Cyrus Jr. He died on October 16, 1941. Legacy. Orson Welles claimed that McCormick's lavish promotion of his second wife's opera career—despite her renown as a terrible singer—was a direct influence on the screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"", wherein the titular character does much the same for his second wife. (Samuel Insull, Thomas Edison's private secretary and later president of a utilities holding empire that included Commonwealth Edison, built the Chicago Civic Opera House (now the Lyric Opera) for his wife, Gladys Wallis, and was another influence, along with actresses Hope Hampton and Marion Davies.)

This group performs around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, especially around the holiday season, when they perform at various venues such as the Fort Worth Petroleum Club, Cooks Children's Hospital, HEBISD conferences, Santa USA, Noteboom Injury Lawyers, and many others. Along with the nearly 30 shows in December alone, Bell System has its annual Showtime performance located in the L.D. Bell auditorium. In 2010, the show choir was featured on the front page of the ""Fort Worth Star-Telegram"" prior to the show in February.  The choral program is continuously recognized throughout the region and country. The choirs often receive the Sweepstakes award at UIL competitions, as well as bring home awards from annual out-of-state competitions. In 2010, the A Cappella choir was named Grand Vocal Champions in The Windy City Classic in Chicago. In October 2009, the A Cappella choir was featured on KERA Television in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. By invitation, the choirs often perform with local orchestras and outside organizations such as the Northeast Tarrant County Orchestra. In March 2012, the choirs traveled to Italy, where they performed at St. Peter's Basilica. The program is expected to nearly double in participation in the next several years. Speech and debate. L.D. Bell also features a vibrant speech and debate program that was revitalized in 1995. The speech and debate organization at the school had been largely non-competitive since the early 1980s. The team has competed in Lincoln-Douglas debates and several speech events at competitions run by the Texas Forensics Association, National Forensics League, and UIL. Famous alumni.

wikipedia-3914787," Le Portrait de Petit Cossette  The series was adapted into a manga series by Asuka Katsura. It spanned two volumes and was published in 2004. The English-language release is published by Tokyopop. Plot. The series focuses on Eiri Kurahashi, a college art student who works in an antique shop. One day, he sees the image of a girl in an antique glass. To his shock, she appears to be moving and living out her life before his eyes. He becomes infatuated with the girl, and one night at midnight, he somehow makes contact with her. He learns that her name is Cossette, and that she was an aristocrat's daughter during the 18th century. She reveals to him that her spirit has been entrapped within the glass because the artist Marcello Orlando murdered her. She tells Eiri that, in order to set her free, a man must be willing to take upon himself punishment for the sins Marcello committed. As the series progresses, Eiri is tortured mentally and physically by Cossette, who demands that he prove his professed love for her. It is revealed that Eiri is the reincarnation of Marcello, and that Cossette is becoming as infatuated with him as he is with her. Also depicted are the efforts of the women in Eiri's life—relatives, friends, mentors, and the girl who secretly loves him—to free him from what is becoming apparent to them as a self-destructive path. Media. OVA. Sony Pictures Entertainment released the three Region 2 DVD compilations from May 26, 2004 to December 22, 2004. On December 1, 2004, the soundtrack to the OVA was released by Wint. It contained eighteen tracks by Yuki Kajiura, including the main theme music . Later released as a single on August 11, 2004, ""Hōseki"" is sung by Marina Inoue. During the period when Geneon Entertainment held the license, the episodes were aired on Fuse TV The anime has since been relicensed by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. The OVA was released on April 20, 2010 and streamed on the Anime Network a month later. ""Petit Cossette"" is also licensed in New Zealand and Australia by Madman Entertainment, and in German by Tokyopop. Manga. ""Le Portrait de Petit Cossette"" appeared as a serial in ""Monthly Magazine Z"". Kodansha collected the chapters into two ""tankōbon"" volume and published them from August 11, 2004, to December 21, 2004. Tokyopop licensed ""Le Portrait de Petit Cossette"" for an English-language release in North America and published the volumes from July 2006 to November 2006. However, both volumes are now out of print. The series is also licensed in France by Asuka Comics. Reception. ""Anime News Network""'s Theron Martin described it as ""an artsy, stylish supernatural horror story about love and obsession. Its dramatic visuals, exceptional artistry, and sumptuous musical scoring make watching it quite an experience, and the story isn't half bad, either."" However, he noted that the storyline of the first two episodes was ""fairly predictable"" and the secondary characters were ""underdeveloped and underused"". Reviewers at Mania Entertainment praised it as ""a love story that's almost devoid of happiness, with a style and presentation that makes it engrossing, and yet not exactly easy to watch"" and ""an easy recommendation for those looking for something more mature from their anime.""

wikipedia-3914792," Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project  Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project deals with a 2006 software branding dispute and its resolution, between the Mozilla Corporation and the Debian Project. The branding issue developed when Mike Connor, representing the Mozilla Corporation, requested that the Debian Project comply with Mozilla standards for use of the Thunderbird trademark when redistributing the Thunderbird software. At issue were modifications not approved by the Mozilla Foundation, when the name for the software remained the same. In 2006, the Debian Project subsequently rebranded the Mozilla Firefox program, and other software released by Mozilla, so that Debian could distribute modified software without being bound by the trademark requirements that the Mozilla Foundation had invoked. The new names established by Debian were Iceweasel for Mozilla Firefox, Icedove for Mozilla Thunderbird, and Iceape for SeaMonkey. These changes were implemented in the subsequent version of Debian (Etch). In July 2007, Iceowl, a rebranded version of Mozilla Sunbird, was added to the unstable branch of Debian. IceWeasel. History and origin of name. Mozilla Foundation owns the trademark “Firefox” and claims the right to deny the use of the name and other trademarks to unofficial builds. The Debian Free Software Guidelines are used by the Debian project to determine whether a license is a free license, which in turn is used to determine whether something can be included in Debian. As the logo did not meet these requirements, it could not be used by software which was to be included in Debian. This effect of the Mozilla trademark policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in 2004 and 2005. During this debate, the name “Iceweasel” was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox. The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode, in reply to Eric Dorland's suggestion of “Icerabbit”. It was intended as a parody of “Firefox”. “Iceweasel” was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy, and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox. By January 1, 2005, rebranding as a strategy was being referred to as the “Iceweasel route”. The term ""ice weasel"" appeared earlier in a line which Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche: """"Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."""" Debian was initially given permission to use the trademarks, and adopted the Firefox name. However, because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, the substituted logo had to remain. Trademark agreement revocation. In February 2006, Mike Connor, representing the Mozilla Corporation, wrote to the Debian bug tracker and informed the project that Mozilla did not consider the way in which Debian was using the Firefox name to be acceptable. Connor confirmed that the Mozilla Corporation was revoking the previous agreement which allowed Debian to use the Firefox name. Further messages from Mike Connor clarified Mozilla's new trademark policies: usage of the Firefox name is not allowed unless the rest of the branding is used and all of the browser's changes are approved by Mozilla Corporation. The immediate problem caused by the new policy was Debian's inability to use the official Firefox logo due to its proprietary license failing to comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Additionally, as Debian releases are frozen on a long-term basis, software in the frozen stable releases needs to be patched for any newly discovered security issue. Under the revised guidelines, in order to use the Firefox name, approval from the Mozilla Corporation would have been required for all security patches, but the Debian project felt it could not put its security in the hands of an external corporation in that manner. The ""Iceweasel"" name was revived in the Debian community as a possible name to give the rebranded version of Firefox. The Iceweasel found in Debian is not GNU IceWeasel (now GNU IceCat) but a rebranded Firefox created by the Debian project. The Debian maintainer has stated that he will ""get in touch with GNU IceCat/IceWeasel team to see what we can do together"". Similarly, Debian renamed Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to Icedove and Iceape, respectively. Rebranding. According to the ""Debian Package Tracking System"", Iceweasel, Icedove and Iceape were first accepted into the Debian project's ""unstable"" repository on November 20, 2006, on October 14, 2006, and on December 1, 2006, respectively. Icedove migrated to Etch and Thunderbird was removed on November 11, 2006. Iceape migrated to Etch on January 11, 2007, (the old Mozilla suite having previously been removed on October 6, 2006). Iceweasel migrated (and Firefox was removed) on January 18, 2007. Debian's first stable release to include Iceweasel, Icedove, and Iceape was Debian 4.0 (Etch), released April 8, 2007. Soon after the renaming Debian also replaced Mozilla's unbranded logos with new logos designed to fit with the new names, drawn by Ricardo Fernandez Fuentes. Subsequent products. Debian's IceWeasel, IceDove, IceOwl, and IceApe are respectively based on Mozilla's Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, and SeaMonkey. The rebranded products still use some Internet-based services from Mozilla, including the Mozilla plugin finder service, and Mozilla add-ons and their update notifications. There has also been no change to how non-free components, such as Flash, are found or used. IceDove. ""Icedove"" is an e-mail client distributed by the Debian project. It is based on Mozilla Thunderbird, but is made entirely of free software. With Icedove, the Debian project aims to provide a version of the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client which has not yet been kept in synchronization with upstream development of Thunderbird as originally planned. It removes the proprietary artwork and plug-in repositories used in the official release by the Mozilla Corporation, which are classified as non-free by free software advocates. IceApe. Iceape is a free software Internet suite based on SeaMonkey. It is developed by the Debian Mozilla Team in unison with the SeaMonkey Council's work on their release, but in accordance with Debian's policy of only using free content, copyrighted artwork and proprietary plug-ins are omitted. A temporary lack of community development support resulted in Iceape being absent from the repository for Debian 5 (""Lenny""), though the iceape-dev and iceape-dev-bin libraries remained available. Support later resumed with Debian 6 (""Squeeze""), and by early 2013, the package was available for both Squeeze and June's release of Debian 7 (""Wheezy""). IceOwl. Iceowl is a calendar application distributed by the Debian project. It is based on Mozilla Sunbird, but is made entirely of free software. Licensing. The rebranded programs are available under Mozilla's standard MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license. Like Mozilla, the default icons are under the same tri-license, but unlike Mozilla, there are no trademark restrictions. User agent problem. Some web sites do not recognise the browsers' User agent strings and refuse to work properly. As a workaround, Iceweasel 3.5.5 adds a ""like Firefox x.x.x"" string to the User-Agent. "
wikipedia-3973020," Ontario Mental Health Act  The Ontario Mental Health Act (OMHA) is an Ontario law which regulates the administration of Mental Health Care. The main purpose of the law is to regulate the involuntary admission of people into a psychiatric hospital. Since the changes brought about in 2000 under Bill 68 (often referred to as ""Brian's Law"", named after Brian Smith who was shot dead in 1995 by a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia), the act allows for a ""community treatment order"" by the attending physician. This order is intended to provide comprehensive treatment outside of a psychiatric facility. Assessment orders Form 1. The following are three common ways that a person may be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility in Ontario for a 72 hour observation period: Police bring person to physician. When a person is acting in a disorderly manner, the act allows the police to take someone already in custody to a designated psychiatric facility for examination by a physician if they believe that the person is an immediate danger to himself or herself, an immediate danger to others, or not able to care for himself or herself to an extent that physical impairment will result. The officer must also believe that the immediate nature of the threat precludes the use of section 16 (Bringing Information before a Justice of the Peace). Person lays information before Justice of Peace. In situations where there is no immediate danger, anyone can bring evidence to a justice of the peace that the person is a danger to himself or herself, a danger to others, or is not able to care for himself or herself. The judge can then order a person to be examined by a physician and fill out a Form 2 authorizing the police to take the person to a physician for examination. Physician orders assessment. Third, where a physician examines a person and has reasonable cause to believe that the person, and if in addition the physician is of the opinion that the person is apparently suffering from mental disorder of a nature or quality that likely will result in, the physician may make application in the prescribed form for a psychiatric assessment of the person. Or, where a physician examines a person and has reasonable cause to believe that the person, and if in addition the physician is of the opinion that the person, the physician may make application in the prescribed form for a psychiatric assessment of the person. The physician fills out a Form 1 authorizing the police to bring the person in for a psychiatric assessment. Involuntary admissions. Once a person has been brought to a psychiatric facility to be assessed, the physician may hold them there for up to 72 hours on an ""application for psychiatric assessment"" (Form 1). This form allows the person to be held at a psychiatric facility for assessment, but does not itself permit any treatment without the persons consent.  Consent to treatment is not covered under the ""Mental Health Act"" but rather the ""Health Care Consent Act"". The physician must also fill out a Form 42 to notify the person and inform them of why they're being held. At the end of the 72 hours permitted by a Form 1, the person must either be released, be admitted as a voluntary patient, or continue to be held as an involuntary patient with a ""certificate of involuntary admission"" (Form 3).  The physician who signs the Form 3 must be different than the physician who signed the initial Form 1.  A Form 3 allows the patient to be held for two weeks and the patient must be notified with a Form 30.  At the end of the two weeks, if the facility is to continue to keep the patient on an involuntary basis, a ""certificate of renewal"" (Form 4) must be filled out. The first time a Form 4 is filled out, it is valid for one month, the second time it is filled out it is valid for two months, each time after that, it is valid for three months. Each time a Form 4 is filled out, another Form 30 must be filled out, notifying the patient. Rights of the patient. A physician who places a person on a Form 3 or Form 4 is required to notify a ""rights adviser"" who is required to meet with the patient and explain to the patient what his or her rights are. If the patient requests it, a rights adviser will also help the patient apply for an appeal or acquire legal services.  If a patient is placed on a Form 3 or Form 4, they have the right to appeal the decision to a ""Consent and Capacity Board"" which will hear the patient's and physician's case. A patient's involuntary status is reviewed by the Board every year whether the patient requests it or not.  The board is composed, at the minimum, of a lawyer, a psychiatrist, and a member of the community (often a family member of someone with mental illness). If the patient or physician disagrees with the Board's decision, they may appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Community treatment orders. The OMHA states that ""the purpose of a community treatment order is to provide a person who suffers from a serious mental disorder with a comprehensive plan of community-based treatment or care and supervision that is less restrictive than being detained in a psychiatric facility. ... to provide such a plan for a person who, as a result of his or her serious mental disorder, experiences this pattern: The person is admitted to a psychiatric facility where his or her condition is usually stabilized; after being released from the facility, the person often stops the treatment or care and supervision; the person’s condition changes and, as a result, the person must be re-admitted to a psychiatric facility.""  When a physician decides that a patient meets the criteria for a community treatment order, a treatment plan is developed with the involvement of all people involved in the plan. In addition to the physician and the patient, people involved in the plan may include other health care workers, social workers, family members, the substitute decision maker, or others. Once the treatment plan is agreed to by all parties, the patient is required to follow the plan while living in the community. Failing to follow the plan can result in the person being readmitted to the hospital on a Form 47. One notable aspect of the community treatment orders is that it allows anyone who is named in the treatment plan to communicate with each other for the purpose of providing treatment, care, or supervision of the person. By removing barriers to communication between members of the health care team, appropriate interventions can be quickly applied when the person is at risk. A community treatment order lasts six months and can be renewed if needed. A person on a community treatment order has the right to see a rights advisor and to appeal to the Consent and Capacity Board. The Board will review community treatment order every year whether the patient requests it or not. "
wikipedia-3973031," Corneal ulcers in animals  A corneal ulcer, or ulcerative keratitis, is an inflammatory condition of the cornea involving loss of its outer layer. It is very common in dogs and is sometimes seen in cats. In veterinary medicine, the term ""corneal ulcer"" is a generic name for any condition involving the loss of the outer layer of the cornea, and as such is used to describe conditions with both inflammatory and traumatic causes. Corneal anatomy of the dog and cat. The cornea is a transparent structure that is part of the outer layer of the eye. It refracts light and protects the contents of the eye. The cornea is about one-half to one millimeter thick in the dog and cat. The trigeminal nerve supplies the cornea via the long ciliary nerves. There are pain receptors in the outer layers and pressure receptors deeper.  Transparency is achieved through a lack of blood vessels, pigmentation, and keratin, and through the organization of the collagen fibers. The collagen fibers cross the full diameter of the cornea in a strictly parallel fashion and allow 99 percent of the light to pass through without scattering. There are four important layers in the dog and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of the thickness of the cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor. Corneal healing. An ulcer of the cornea heals by two methods: migration of surrounding epithelial cells followed by mitosis (dividing) of the cells, and introduction of blood vessels from the conjunctiva. Superficial small ulcers heal rapidly by the first method. However, larger or deeper ulcers often require the presence of blood vessels to supply inflammatory cells. White blood cells and fibroblasts produce granulation tissue and then scar tissue, effectively healing the cornea. Superficial and deep corneal ulcers. Corneal ulcers are one of the most common eye diseases in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). There have been at least two cases where corneal ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus. Superficial ulcers involve a loss of part of the epithelium. Deep ulcers extend into or through the stroma and can result in severe scarring and corneal perforation. Descemetoceles occur when the ulcer extends through the stroma, exposing Descemet's membrane. This type of ulcer is especially dangerous and can result in perforation. The location of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, dry eye, or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Ulcers in the inferior nasal cornea may be caused by foreign material trapped under the third eyelid. Entropion or distichiae may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and sclera. Symptoms. Corneal ulcers are painful due to nerve exposure, and can cause tearing, squinting, and pawing at the eye. There may also be signs of anterior uveitis, such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye. An axon reflex may be responsible for uveitis formation — stimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine. Diagnosis. Diagnosis is through direct observation of the ulcer with the use of fluorescein stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green. With descemetoceles, Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis. Treatment. Treatment of corneal ulcers includes topical antibiotic therapy to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Atropine may decrease tear production and interfere with corneal healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal in less than a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require corneal suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse. Bioscaffold. A new bioscaffold developed by TR BioSurgical is being evaluated for refractory corneal ulcers in dogs. The study is being conducted by board certified veterinary ophthalmologists and has shown promise in healing refractory ulcers that have failed conventional treatment . Refractory corneal ulcers. Refractory corneal ulcers are superficial ulcers that heal poorly and tend to recur. They are also known as indolent ulcers or Boxer ulcers. They are believed to be caused by a defect in the basement membrane and a lack of hemidesmosomal attachments. They are recognized by undermined epithelium that surrounds the ulcer and easily peels back. Refractory corneal ulcers are most commonly seen in middle aged or older dogs and often occur in the other eye later. They are similar to Cogan's cystic dystrophy in humans. Treatment. Refractory corneal ulcers can take a long time to heal, sometimes months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine. Melting ulcers. Melting ulcers are a type of corneal ulcer involving progressive loss of stroma in a dissolving fashion. This is most commonly seen in ""Pseudomonas"" infection, but it can be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi. These infectious agents produce proteases and collagenases which break down the corneal stroma. Complete loss of the stroma can occur within 24 hours. Treatment includes antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors such as acetylcysteine and homologous blood serum. Surgery may be necessary. Corneal ulcers in cats. Corneal ulcers in cats can be caused by trauma, detergent burns, infections, and other eye diseases. One common cause not seen in dogs is infection with feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1). FHV-1 causes ulceration by direct infection of the epithelial cells. Lesions appear as round or dendritic (branching) ulcers. FHV-1 also suppresses healing of the cornea. Symptoms include conjunctivitis, squinting, eye discharge, and blood vessels on the cornea. It can cause severe scarring. Treatment is with topical antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and oral L-lysine, which competes with arginine and inhibits viral replication. Corneal ulcers in horses. Corneal ulceration is a very common disease of the equine eye and can have sight-threatening consequences. Aggressive treatment is always indicated, as even apparently mild ulcers can progress quickly, causing serious complications. Causes. A distinct cause for initial ulceration is not commonly found, although in many cases it can be assumed to be traumatic in origin. The horse's eye is especially vulnerable to trauma due to its prominent position, compared with other species. Exposure keratitis (inflamed cornea) can occur in the horse, most commonly secondary to facial nerve paralysis. Hospitalised animals have been shown to have a decreased corneal reflex, and this corresponds to an increased incidence of ulcers in the hospitalised population. Foreign bodies embedded in the palpebral conjunctiva or the nictitating membrane can cause persistent irritation and ulceration. Often the shape and distribution of the lesion is suggestive of this aetiology, but even in the absence of a characteristic lesion their presence should be considered and sought out. Bacterial and fungal infection occurs readily after the initial ulceration, as disruption of the corneal epithelium allows attachment and colonisation of the underlying tissues by normal corneal commensals. Commonly isolated bacteria include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and empirical anti-microbial therapy should be effective against these bacteria. Diagnosis. Differential diagnoses for the painful equine eye: A full ocular exam should be performed for every case of eye pain. Fluoroscein staining is usually diagnostic for corneal ulcers, although staining with Rose Bengal is also recommended as it can pick up early viral/fungal lesions, which will appear as multifocal disturbances to the tear film. Culture and sensitivity is recommended for rapidly progressive or deep corneal ulcers. Cotton swabbing is often inadequate, and corneal scraping, for example, with the blunt side of a scalpel blade is usually required. This can be greatly facilitated by the use of local nerve blocks and topical anaesthesia. There is almost invariably a secondary uveitis present with corneal ulceration, and signs of this may also be seen: miosis, corneal oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes. Treatment. Medical therapy should be based upon the severity of disease initially, and then by the response to therapy. The aims of the initial therapy are: The initial choice of antibiotic depends upon personal choice, experience and availability, but could include chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and tobramycin. Topical gentamicin formulations are also available, but in the opinion of some, should be reserved for cases with stromal melting. Frequency of application can vary from q1h to q8h, depending on both the severity of the lesion, and the formulation used (ointment vs. drops). Much of the pain associated with corneal ulceration is due to the secondary uveitis and miosis, and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to mydriasis. Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. Mydriasis is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with uveitis, such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1 mg/kg, BID. Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time. In horses that are difficult to treat, or in cases that require very frequent treatment, then placement of a sub-palpebral lavage system can be very useful. As an adjunct to therapy, physical protection of the eye may be required, in the form of a mask. Some horses will rub their eyes in response to pain, and this can cause further corneal damage. Box rest is also vital, as over-exertion has been linked to intra-ocular haemorrhage and increased severity of uveitis. Success in your therapeutic regime can be judged by a reduction in pain, and a decrease in size of the ulcer. Healing generally occurs rapidly at first, followed by a slowing after 5–7 days. As a rough guide, a non-infected ulcer can be expected to heal at approximately 0.6mm/day. Complications. In cases where the ulcer is not healing: Melting ulcers reflect inappropriate collagenolysis of the corneal stroma, by matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). Bacterial pathogens (especially Pseudomonas and β-haemolytic Streptococcus) induce the corneal epithelial cells and resident leucocytes to upregulate pro-inflammatory, and MMP-activating cytokines (IL-1,-6 and -8). These bacteria can also produce their own proteinases. The combination of exogenous, and upregulated endogenous, proteinases leads to a rapid breakdown of collagen, with the characteristic melting appearance. Untreated this can lead to perforation within 12 hours (so act hard and fast!). There are several therapeutic options for inhibiting MMPs: A combination of the above may be necessary early in the disease course. Effective antibiosis is also paramount, and gentamicin is a good empirical choice (although there are some reports of gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas species). Obviously, treating an eye this frequently in practice will be difficult, so referral is probably the best option. "
wikipedia-3973082," Cabin cruiser  A cabin cruiser is a type of power boat that provides accommodation for its crew and passengers inside the structure of the craft. A cabin cruiser usually ranges in size from in length, with larger pleasure craft usually considered yachts. Many cabin cruisers can be recovered and towed with a trailer and thus easily stored on land, which reduces maintenance and expense. These craft are generally equipped with a head (toilet), a galley, and at least one berth. Most cabin cruisers usually have a small dining area and some have an aft cabin (a cabin to the rear of the cockpit, with a double bed) Some cabin cruisers are equipped with heating, air conditioning, and power generators. Most also have water heaters and shore power electric systems. The cabin cruiser provides many of the amenities of larger yachts, while costing much less and normally being fully operable by the owner, whereas larger yachts often require a professional crew. Most newer cabin cruisers are faster than older models because of improved aerodynamic and hydrodynamic designs. Cabin cruisers are generally able to handle the water well because of their size and give a stable ride. They are generally spacious in the cockpit (open seating area towards at aft or centre). In the UK, purpose-built cabin cruisers were popular on the canal network in the 1960s and 1970s. Leading manufacturers were Norman, Viking, Microplus, and Dawncraft. Today, they are more commonly found on the navigable rivers rather than canals. "
wikipedia-3973093," Oasis discography  The discography of English rock band Oasis consists of seven studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums, six video albums, one extended play, twenty-nine singles, nineteen promotional singles and thirty-six music videos. The band have sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide and have also been cited by ""Guinness World Records"" as the most successful act in the United Kingdom between the years 1995 and 2005. Oasis was formed in 1991 by vocalist Liam Gallagher, guitarist Paul ""Bonehead"" Arthurs, bassist Paul ""Guigsy"" McGuigan and drummer Tony McCarroll – they were later joined guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher. The band signed to Creation Records in May 1993 and released their debut single ""Supersonic"" the following year; it peaked at number 31 in the United Kingdom. Follow-up singles ""Shakermaker"" and ""Live Forever"" became UK top 15 hits, with the latter also attaining success in the United States. ""Definitely Maybe"", the band's debut studio album, topped the UK Albums Chart and went on to be certified seven times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Oasis released their second studio album ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"" in October 1995. It was a huge commercial success, topping the charts in the UK and in multiple other countries, including Australia, Canada and Ireland. The album produced six singles, including the band's first UK number-one single ""Some Might Say"" and the international hits ""Wonderwall"" and ""Don't Look Back in Anger"". ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"" has sold over twenty-two million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling albums of all-time. The album was certified fourteen times platinum by the BPI and is the fifth biggest-selling album in the UK, with sales of over 4.5 million copies in the country. The band's third studio album ""Be Here Now"" was released to great anticipation in August 1997. While the album topped the charts in several countries and became the fastest-selling album in British history, it failed to match the commercial success of ""Morning Glory"". Two of the album's singles, ""D'You Know What I Mean?"" and ""All Around the World"", peaked at number one in the UK. Oasis' fourth studio album ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" was released in February 2000, reaching number one in the UK and Ireland. Though not as commercially successful as its predecessors, ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" managed to receive a double platinum certification from the BPI and featured three UK top five singles: ""Go Let It Out"", ""Who Feels Love?"" and ""Sunday Morning Call"". ""Heathen Chemistry"" followed in July 2002, becoming Oasis' fifth consecutive number-one album in the UK and being certified triple platinum by the BPI. ""Don't Believe the Truth"", released in May 2005, topped the UK Albums Chart and produced the number-one singles ""Lyla"" and ""The Importance of Being Idle"". In November 2006, the band released a compilation album, ""Stop the Clocks"", which peaked at number two in the UK and was preceded by the release of an EP of the same name. Oasis released their seventh studio album ""Dig Out Your Soul"" in October 2008; it continued the band's streak of number-one studio albums in the UK and was certified double platinum by the BPI by the end of the year. Following the release of ""Dig Out Your Soul"" and Noel Gallagher's departure from the band in August 2009, Oasis announced their break-up. In June 2010, a retrospective compilation album of the band's singles entitled ""Time Flies... 1994–2009"" was released, peaking at number one in the UK. "
wikipedia-3973096," Saturn Relay  The Saturn Relay was the first and only minivan from the Saturn brand of American automaker General Motors. It was introduced for the 2005 model year, and was built alongside its sisters, the Buick Terraza, the Chevrolet Uplander, and the Pontiac Montana SV6 in Doraville, Georgia. The Relay was the first Saturn vehicle without polymer side paneling, and is also the first Saturn that is a rebadged Chevrolet or Pontiac. The Relay was introduced with a 3.5 L LX9 V6 that generates and torque, going from 0-60 mph in the 9-second range seconds. For 2006, a 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option, which delivered faster acceleration and better response than the 3.5L engine. For 2007, the 3.5 L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9 L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9 L engine. Also in 2007, the Relay received an optional flex-fuel engine but only for fleet applications. The Relay scored three ""Good""s (the highest possible score) and two ""acceptable""s (the second highest possible score) in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests. In terms of gas mileage, the Relay is rated at city, highway. The Relay started at US$22,850. There were three available trim levels, ""2FWD"", ""3FWD"", and ""3AWD"". All Relays seat seven via folding/removable 2nd row captains chairs and a 50/50 third-row bench. The third-row bench folds flat but did not fold entirely into the floor. OnStar assistance and a DVD rear entertainment system came standard on all Relays. A navigation system was optional on Relay 3s. Front side airbags were standard on 3s and optional for the 2. Second-row side airbags were optional on all models. Changes. 2006. 2006 models added the GM badges on the doors. 2007. The final model year of the Relay. The Saturn badging was dropped from the doors & the all-wheel drive option disappeared. The Relay was discontinued in 2007 and the Doraville, Georgia assembly plant closed in September 2008. The last Relay rolled off the line on November 17, 2006. The Relay was replaced by the 8-passenger, Lambda-based Outlook crossover SUV. "
wikipedia-3973131," Hypermobility  Hypermobility describes joints that stretch farther than normal. For example, some hypermobile people can bend their thumbs backwards to their wrists, bend their knee joints backwards, put their leg behind the head or perform other contortionist ""tricks"". It can affect a single joint or multiple joints throughout the body. Causes. Hypermobility generally results from one or more of the following: These abnormalities cause abnormal stress on a joint or many joints, meaning that the joints can wear out, leading to osteoarthritis. The condition tends to run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic basis for at least some forms of hypermobility. The term ""double jointed"" is often used to describe hypermobility; however, the name is a misnomer and should not be taken literally, as an individual with hypermobility in a joint does not actually have two separate joints where others would have just one. Most people have hypermobility with no other symptoms. In fact, approximately 5% of the healthy population have hypermobile joints. However, people with ""joint hypermobility syndrome"" may experience many difficulties. For example, their joints may be easily injured, be more prone to complete dislocation due to the weakly stabilized joint and they may develop problems from muscle fatigue (as muscles must work harder to compensate for the excessive weakness in the ligaments that support the joints). Hypermobility syndrome can also lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases. Instrumentalists with hypermobile fingers may have difficulties when fingers collapse into the finger locking position. Hypermobility may also be symptomatic of a serious medical condition, such as Stickler Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, lupus, polio, Down syndrome, morquio syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis or myotonia congenita. In addition, hypermobility has been associated with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Just as people with hypermobility have a higher risk for Osteoarthritis, they may also have a higher risk for Fibromyalgia. Some speculate that those with Fibromyalgia might have some form of Connective Tissue Disorder, such as the ones that cause hypermobility. Hypermobility causes physical trauma (In the form of Joint Dislocations, Joint Subluxations, Joint Instability, Sprains, etc), in turn causes emotional trauma; physical trauma, emotional trauma, and a few other factors either trigger and/or are possible causes for Fibromyalgia.  During pregnancy certain hormones alter the physiology of ligaments making them able to stretch to accommodate the birthing process. For some women with hypermobility pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain can be debilitating due to these two converging factors, and prohibits them from standing up or walking. Use of a bedpan and wheelchair may be necessary, or even permanent in some cases due to hip stretching. Also many people complain about joints or muscles hurting because of this. Symptoms of hypermobility include a dull but intense pain around the knee and ankle joints and the soles of the feet. The condition affecting these parts can be alleviated by using insoles in the footwear that have been specially made for the individual after assessment by an orthopaedic surgeon and orthotist. Anxiety and joint hypermobility. In 1998, a study was done concerning the link between panic disorder with joint hypermobility. The prevalence of joint hypermobility syndrome among patients with panic disorder was 67.7% compared to the control psychiatric group (10.1%). Women and subjects who were younger were found to be over 20 times more likely to have the hypermobile joints than their counterparts in the control group. In the study, there was also a higher prevalence for mitral valve prolapse (8%). The study does not determine whether hypermobility is associated in any way with psychiatric dysfunction or dysautonomia; many factors could explain the relation, and hypermobility's unwelcome gift of chronic pain may very well cause many people anxiety or depression. These people feel alone in that nobody understands their disorder and they find it difficult to explain to skeptics because their body looks perfectly normal. Often accused of not getting enough rest these patients become agitated that their previous life activities become increasingly difficult as their condition worsens. Lashing out, anxiety, depression, and sadness are all common  Hypermobility syndrome. Hypermobility syndrome is generally considered to comprise hypermobility together with other symptoms, such as myalgia and arthralgia. It is relatively common among children and affects more females than males. Causes. Current thinking suggests that there are four factors: These four factors affect different people to varying degrees. Hypermobility can also be caused by Connective Tissue Disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Joint Hypermobility is a common symptom for both of these. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome has numerous types; however, most types have hypermobility in some degree. When hypermobility is the main symptom, to where it overshadows the rest, then it most likely is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - The Hypermobility Type (EDS-HT). People with EDS-HT suffer frequent joint dislocations and subluxations (partial/incomplete dislocations), with or without trauma, and sometimes spontaneously. Commonly, the hypermobility is assumed by medical professionals to be nonpainful, mild, and dismissed in general. Consequently, they receive little to no treatment and left to suffer debilitating pain by many health professionals. They are labeled hypochondriacs, lazy, and/or as if the pain were a figment of their imagination. Symptoms. People with hypermobility syndrome may develop other conditions caused by their unstable joints. These conditions include: Diagnosis. Joint hypermobility syndrome needs to be distinguished from other disorders that share many common features, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta. In the last couple of years, collaborations of experts in connective tissue disorders formally agreed that there was little distinction between severe forms of Hypermobility Syndrome and mild forms Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type, and that they are in fact the same disorder. Information on this can be found in an article titled ""The lack of clinical distinction between the hypermobility type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and the joint hypermobility syndrome (a.k.a. hypermobility syndrome)"" Generalized hypermobility is a common feature in all these hereditary connective tissue disorders and many features overlap, but often distinguishing features are present that enable differentiating these disorders. The inheritance pattern of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies by type. The arthrochalasia, classic, hypermobility, and vascular forms of the disorder usually have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new (sporadic) gene mutations. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. The dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and some cases of the classic and hypermobility forms, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Beighton's criteria. As of July 2000, hypermobility is diagnosed using the Beighton criteria. The Beighton criteria do not replace the Beighton score but instead use the previous criteria in conjunction with other symptoms. HMS is diagnosed in the presence of either two major criteria, one major and two minor criteria, or four minor criteria. The criteria are as follows: Beighton score. The Beighton score is an edited version of the Carter & Wilkinson scoring system which has been used for many years as an indicator of widespread hyper-mobility. However medical professionals varied in their interpretations of the results; some accepting as low as 1/9 and some 4/9 as a diagnosis of HMS. Therefore it was incorporated, with clearer guidelines, into the Beighton Criteria. The Beighton score is measured by adding 1 point for each of the following: Treatments. Physical therapy. It is important that the individual with hypermobility remain extremely fit - even more so than the average individual - to prevent recurrent injuries. Regular exercise and physical therapy or hydrotherapy can reduce symptoms of hypermobility because strong muscles increase joint stability. These treatments can also help by stretching tight, overused muscles and ensuring the person uses joints within the ideal ranges of motion, avoiding hyperextension or hyperflexion. Low-impact exercise such as Pilates or T'ai chi is usually recommended for hypermobile people as it is less likely to cause injury than high-impact exercise or contact sports. Moist hot packs can relieve the pain of aching joints and muscles. For some patients, ice packs also help to relieve pain. Medication. Medications frequently used to reduce pain and inflammation caused by hypermobility include analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs (though these have been linked with an increase in pain and joint instability for some sufferers), and tricyclic antidepressants. Some people with hypermobility may benefit from other medications such as steroid injections or gabapentin, a drug originally used for treating epilepsy. Tramadol, a non-narcotic yet opioid pain reliever that is nearly as effective as narcotics, has been used in England to treat HMS joint pain, and it is available either by prescription from a doctor in the United States or from Mexico. Benzodiazapines are also used in HMS sufferers who experience painful muscles spasms around loose joints. Lifestyle modification. For some people with hypermobility, lifestyle changes decrease the severity of symptoms. For example: References. Grahame R.

wikipedia-3973178," Districts of Sri Lanka  In Sri Lanka, districts (, ) are the second-level administrative divisions, and are included in a province. There are 25 districts organized into 9 provinces. Each district is administered under a District Secretary, who is appointed by the central government. The main tasks of the District Secretariat involve coordinating communications and activities of the central government and Divisional Secretariats. The District Secretariat is also responsible for implementing and monitoring development projects at the district level and assisting lower-level subdivisions in their activities, as well as revenue collection and coordination of elections in the district. A district is divided into a number of Divisional Secretary Divisions (commonly known as DS divisions), which are in turn subdivided into Grama Niladari Divisions. There are 256 DS divisions in the country. History. The country was first divided into several administrative units during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The kingdom was divided into three provinces; ""Rajarata"", ""Ruhuna"" and ""Malaya Rata"". These were further subdivided into smaller units called ""rata"". Over time, the number of provinces increased, but the second-level administrative division continued to be the ""rata"". However, with the country eventually being divided into more than one kingdom and with foreign colonial missions landing and taking parts of the country under their control, this structure began to change. The territory of the Kotte Kingdom was organized into four ""disavas"", which were further subdivided into forty ""korales"". The ""korales"" had their own civil and military officials with a small militia. The Jaffna kingdom appears to have had a similar administrative structure to this with four provinces. When the Portuguese took over parts of the country after their arrival in 1505, they maintained more or less the same administrative structure followed by Sri Lankan rulers. During the Dutch rule in the country, the terrain under their control was divided into three administrative divisions. These were subdivided into ""disavas"" as in earlier systems. The British initially continued this system, but following reforms in 1796 to 1802, the country was divided according to ethnic composition. This was abolished by the Colebrook–Cameron reforms in 1833 and a legislative council was created, making the island a politically and administratively single unit. Five provinces were created, later expanded into nine, and these were subdivided into twenty-one districts. These districts were administered by officials known as Government Agents or Assistant Government Agents. In 1955, the district replaced the province as the country's main administrative unit. The Ampara district was created in 1958, followed by the creation of Mullaitivu and Gampaha districts in 1978 through a new constitution, which also reintroduced the province as the main administrative unit. The last district to be created was Kilinochchi in 1983, and the current constitution (that of 1978) states that the territory of Sri Lanka consists of 25 administrative districts. These districts may be subdivided or amalgamated by a resolution of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Districts. All population data are from the most recent census of Sri Lanka, in 2001. The districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi were not covered in this census because of security reasons, and Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Mannar were only partially covered. Therefore, the population statistics for these districts are estimates. These are marked by a * symbol. "
wikipedia-3973197," Poʻouli  The Poouli or Black-faced Honeycreeper (""Melamprosops phaeosoma"") is a critically endangered and possibly extinct bird species that is endemic to Hawaiʻi. It is considered to be a member of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, and is the only member of its genus Melamprosops. Poouli are brown above, greyish-white below, with broad black mask extending behind eye. Adults are silvery-grey above mask, shading into brown of crown, with bold, pale patch just behind mask. Juveniles are similar but buffier below with smaller mask and without grey above. Most earlier published images of the Poouli were of the juvenile plumage. Discovery, taxonomy and behavior. The Poouli was not discovered until 1973 by students from the University of Hawaiʻi, who found the bird on the north-eastern slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui. It was found during the Hana Rainforest Project at an altitude of above sea level. The Poouli was the first species of Hawaiian Honeycreeper to be discovered since 1923. It is dissimilar to other Hawaiian birds. Evidence based on DNA suggests it belongs to an ancient lineage of honeycreepers. It appears to have out-lived all its close relatives; that is if it had any close relatives. No other bird - living or fossil - has a structure similar to it. It feeds mostly on snails, insects, and spiders and nests in native ‘ōhi‘a lehua (""Metrosideros polymorpha"") forests. Status. In the past, according to fossil records, it seems that the bird lived on the dry half of the island of Maui, across southwestern slope of Halekala at altitudes of . 100–200 Poouli were estimated to exist when the species was first discovered. There were only 76 birds per km². By 1981, there were only 15 birds per km². By 1985, there were only 8 per km². That meant that from the year 1975, when it was first discovered, to 1985, only ten years later, the population had dropped by over 90 percent. In the 1980s, the Poouli disappeared from the easternmost part of its range and was now only found in the western branch of the Hanawi Stream.  To preserve the Poouli and other endangered fauna and flora, the State of Hawaii established the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve. This connected several protected areas to make one larger protective area. This protection effort was only possible due to the work of several groups: the government, Maui County, the National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and several private companies. The land was fenced off and by June 1996 they began to clear out the pigs from the closed areas. Four years and 202 pigs later, the Poouli pen was completely cleared of pigs. As more pigs were removed from the other two pens, population of native species that lived there, e.g. the Maui Parrotbill and ʻAkohekohe, rose slightly faster than they otherwise would have. Rats, cats, and goats were still being removed from the Poouli pen. By 1997, only three individuals were known to exist. These had home ranges within the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and the adjacent Haleakala National Park. In 2002, one of these, a female, was captured and taken to a male's home range in an attempt to get them to breed. The female, however, had flown back to her own territory, which was away, by the next day. There was also a ten-day expedition in 2004. The goal of this was to capture all three birds and bring them to a bird conservation center on the island, in the hope they would produce offspring. On September 9, 2004, one of the remaining birds, a male, was captured and taken to the Maui Bird Conservation Center in Olinda, in an attempt to captively breed the bird. However, biologists could not find a mate for the male before it died on November 26, 2004. Tissue samples have been taken from the male for possible future cloning, but as neither birds of the opposite sex are now available nor natural behavior can be imprinted on possible cloned individuals, this does not seem probable. As such efforts would likely compete with conservation funding of extant bird species, it may not even be desirable as a cloning attempt would both be highly likely to fail and at the same time jeopardize the survival of other highly threatened species. If the two remaining birds still survive, they are at least ten years of age, nearing the end of their life, and probably have not been fertile for a few years. It is uncertain whether they are a male and female, or both are of the same sex. Since 2004, extensive surveys have failed to locate these or other individuals of this species and it could be extinct, but remains listed as Critically Endangered by BirdLife International (and thereby IUCN) until additional surveys have confirmed its extinction beyond reasonable doubt. The dramatic population decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including habitat loss, mosquito-borne diseases, predation by pigs, rats, cats, and Small Asian Mongooses, and a decline in the native tree snails that the Poouli relies on for food. Popular culture. The Poouli bird is referenced in a lounge inspired number less elegy than celebratory memorialization, Poouli, appearing on John Zorn's album O'o (another extinct endemic bird species of Hawai'i Nei) along with a number of other Hawai'iana tracks and bird songs of species illustrated on the albums cover. The personnel on the sessions compose a New York underground supergroup, consisting of Mark Ribot, Trevor Dunn, among others. "
wikipedia-3973229," American-180  The American-180 is a submachine gun developed in the 1960s which fires .22 LR cartridges from a pan magazine. The concept began with the Casull Model 290 that used a flat pan magazine similar to designs widely used prior to World War II. Only 80 Casull M290s were built and the weapon was expensive to produce. The American-180 is an improved version. A semi-automatic only variant called the American SAR 180/275 is still produced on a custom basis by E&L Manufacturing of Riddle, Oregon. Operation. The weapon operates through a conventional blowback mechanism. It uses an open bolt with a flat pan magazine. It fires at a relatively high rate of fire of around 1,200 RPM. The American-180 was purchased mostly by private parties prior to the American ban on production of machine guns for the US civilian market. The A180 was adopted by the Utah Department of Corrections to arm prison guards. Despite the relatively low power of the .22 LR round, testing demonstrated that automatic fire could penetrate even concrete and bulletproof vests from cumulative damage. However, the target would have to remain still for an improbable amount of time to allow the cumulative damage to amass in the same area to achieve this. "

In a 2004 interview with Gelb, ""The Guardian"" wrote ""Gelb's way of dealing with it was to treat Giant Sand (not to be confused with his 1970s electro-rock band Giant Sandworms) as a loose, uncompetitive, mutually supportive musical collective, a place for friends to hang out and play.

In a 2006 interview, Gelb said """"Sno Angel"" is now the name of this project. Like you had Arizona Amp, OP8 and all those other ones. So the way I regulate them is to keep them with their own flavour, and if this takes on a life of its own...which this may well do...it will make time for itself.

wikipedia-3973438," High-altitude nuclear explosion  High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANE) have historically been nuclear explosions which take place above altitudes of 30 km, still inside the Earth's atmosphere. Such explosions have been tests of nuclear weapons, used to determine the effects of the blast and radiation in the exoatmospheric environment. The highest was at an altitude of 540 km (335.5 mi). The only nations to detonate nuclear weapons in outer space are the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. program began in 1958 with the ""Hardtack Teak"" and ""Hardtack Orange"" shots, both 3.8 megatons. These warheads were initially carried on Redstone rockets. Later tests were delivered by Thor missiles for Operation Dominic I tests, and modified Lockheed X-17 missiles for the Argus tests. The purpose of the shots was to determine both feasibility of nuclear weapons as an anti-ballistic missile defense, as well as a means to defeat satellites and manned orbiting vehicles in space. High-altitude nuclear blasts produce significantly different effects. In the lower reaches of vacuous space, the resulting fireball grows much larger and faster than it does near the ground, and the radiation it emits travels much farther. EMP generation. The strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that results has several components. In the first few tens of nanoseconds, about a tenth of a percent of the weapon yield appears as powerful gamma rays with energies of one to three mega-electron volts (MeV, a unit of energy). The gamma rays penetrate the atmosphere and collide with air molecules, depositing their energy to produce huge quantities of positive ions and recoil electrons (also known as Compton electrons). The impacts create MeV-energy Compton electrons that then accelerate and spiral along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The resulting transient electric fields and currents that arise generate electromagnetic emissions in the radio frequency range of 15 to 250 megahertz (MHz, or one million cycles per second). This high-altitude EMP occurs between 30 and 50 kilometers (18 and 31 miles) above the Earth's surface. The potential as an anti-satellite weapon became apparent in August 1958 during ""Hardtack Teak"". The EMP observed at the Apia Observatory at Samoa was four times more powerful than any created by solar storms, while in July 1962 the ""Starfish Prime"" test damaged electronics in Honolulu and New Zealand (approximately 1,300 kilometers away), fused 300 street lights on Oahu (Hawaii), set off about 100 burglar alarms, and caused the failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai, which cut off the sturdy telephone system from the other Hawaiian islands. The radius for an effective satellite kill for the various prompt radiations produced by such a nuclear weapon in space was determined to be roughly 80 km. Further testing to this end was carried out, and embodied in a Department of Defense program, ""Program 437"". Drawbacks. There are problems with nuclear weapons carried over to testing and deployment scenarios, however. Because of the very large radius associated with nuclear events, it was nearly impossible to prevent indiscriminate damage to other satellites, including one's own satellites. ""Starfish Prime"" produced an artificial radiation belt in space which soon destroyed three satellites (Ariel, TRAAC, and Transit 4B all failed after traversing the radiation belt, while Cosmos V, Injun I and Telstar 1 suffered minor degradation, due to some radiation damage to solar cells, etc.). The radiation dose rate was at least 60 rads/day at four months after ""Starfish"" for a well-shielded satellite or manned capsule in a polar circular earth orbit, which caused NASA concern with regard to its manned space exploration programs. Differences from atmospheric tests. In general, nuclear effects in space (or very high altitudes) have a qualitatively different display. While an atmospheric nuclear explosion has a characteristic mushroom-shaped cloud, high-altitude and space explosions tend to manifest a spherical 'cloud,' reminiscent of other space-based explosions until distorted by Earth's magnetic field, and the charged particles resulting from the blast can cross hemispheres to create an auroral display which has led documentary maker Peter Kuran to characterize these detonations as 'the rainbow bombs'. The visual effects of a high-altitude or space-based explosion may last longer than atmospheric tests, sometimes in excess of 30 minutes. Heat from the ""Bluegill Triple Prime"" shot, at an altitude of 50 kilometers (31 mi), was felt by personnel on the ground at Johnston Atoll, and this test caused retina burns to two personnel at ground zero who were not wearing their safety goggles. Soviet high-altitude tests. The Soviets detonated four high-altitude tests in 1961 and three in 1962. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, both the US and the USSR detonated several high-altitude nuclear explosions as a form of saber-rattling. The Soviet tests were meant to demonstrate their anti-ballistic missile defenses which would supposedly protect their major cities in the event of a nuclear war. The worst effects of a Soviet high-altitude test occurred on 22 October 1962, in ‘Operation K’ (ABM System A proof tests) when a 300 kt missile-warhead detonated near Dzhezkazgan at 290-km altitude. The EMP fused 570 km of overhead telephone line with a measured current of 2,500 A, started a fire that burned down the Karaganda power plant, and shut down 1,000-km of shallow-buried power cables between Aqmola and Almaty. The Partial Test Ban Treaty was passed the following year, ending atmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear tests. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 banned the stationing and use of nuclear weapons in space.

wikipedia-3973454," Linn LM-1  The LM-1 Drum Computer, manufactured by Linn Electronics Inc., was the first drum machine to use digital samples of acoustic drums. Conceived and designed by Roger Linn, it was also one of the first programmable drum machines. It was introduced in early 1980 at a list price of US$4,995, climbed to $5,500 when additional features were incorporated, fell to $4,995 as cost-cutting measures were introduced, and later reduced to $3,995 before it was discontinued after the release of its successor, the LinnDrum. It is prized by amateur and professional musicians alike for its rarity as well as its characteristic sounds, which can be heard on the recordings of such famous artists as Prince, Michael Jackson, The Human League, Peter Gabriel, Kraftwerk and countless other pop hits of the 1980s. History. Roger Linn was a semi-professional guitarist in California in 1978 when he began to develop the LM-1 as an accompaniment tool for his home studio. He had experimented with many of the preset rhythm boxes which were popular at the time, but was dissatisfied and ""wanted a drum machine that did more than play preset samba patterns and didn't sound like crickets."" [http://www.synthmuseum.com/linn/index.html] Having learned how to program in BASIC and assembly language, Linn set to work on a computer program which could play user-programmed rhythm patterns, as well as chain them together to form a song. According to Linn, the first to suggest the idea of digital samples was Steve Porcaro of Toto. Linn himself doesn't remember exactly who played the sounds used for the samples; it has been suggested that they were a combination of several Los Angeles session drummers, possibly James Gadson, Art Wood, Ron Tutt, or Steve's brother Jeff Porcaro, also of Toto. Linn achieved his sounds by using a chip, built into the machine, which converted the digital samples into analog audio. His first prototype, manufactured some time during 1979, was a cardboard box which contained the electronic components of the drum machine. Supposedly, Linn brought this prototype to parties and jobs and marketed it to fellow musicians, including Peter Gabriel, the members of Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie Wonder, who bought one of the first units ever produced. In total, approximately 725 units were built and sold between 1980 and 1983, when the LM-1's successor, the LinnDrum, was released. The first 35 units were assembled in Linn's home, before manufacturing and distribution was taken over by 360 Systems, run by Bob Easton. The first 10 of these 35 units have somewhat unique characteristics, as described below. Features. The LM-1's many features set it apart from other drum machines of its time, most of which could only play a limited selection of preset rhythms (i.e. Roland CompuRhythm CR-78). One of its most prominent features was its programmability. Although the Linn LM-1 was not the first programmable drum machine (the PAiA Programmable Drum Set was released 6 years earlier), it was the first to use digital samples and gained widespread popularity among professionals. The LM-1 also introduced a shuffle feature that enabled users to program swing notes into their rhythms. Although this feature has often been imitated, the Linn shuffle has widely been recognized as the best and most natural-sounding, and is present on every device Linn designed, including the Akai MPC series. The LM-1 included a built-in 13-channel mixer (one channel for each sound) as well as individual output jacks. This enabled Linn's machine to integrate with existing recording equipment in a way that had previously not been possible for a drum machine. Unlike the later Linndrum, the LM-1 also had individual tuning pots for each voice, resulting in many famous users expressing their preference for the LM-1 long after the Linndrum was introduced. Unlike its younger brother, the LM-1 lacked crash and ride cymbal sounds (which producers easily compensated for by having live cymbals overdubbed onto whatever track was being recorded) and the drum sounds could not be triggered by MIDI or trigger inputs. Nevertheless, the LM-1's sounds are very punchy and prominent. There are notable differences between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of shuffle LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued because they were too expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as nice as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously. In the Rev.1 LM-1s, the first 10 have no serial numbers or pre-printed, adhesive-backed manufacturer's label on the rear panel, have a single molded metal frame for the front, bottom, and rear panels, have higher quality mixer pots, have two knobs for tempo control (coarse and fine; the fine control actually may have been intended for a rotary switch to program the shuffle setting), and are screen printed ""Linn and Moffett Electronics"" instead of ""Linn Electronics"" on the lower right front of the chassis beneath the drum buttons (Moffett was an early investor in the Linn drum computer development). There are other minor mechanical differences, too. The Rev. 2 LM-1 introduced two rows of LEDs to indicate the shuffle and quantize settings, several additional buttons on the front panel to aid in programming, and a shared filter on the toms and congas, as well as the kick drum. There were a handful of Rev. 2 LM-1's with both engraved buttons and shuffle LEDs but these are extremely rare. Cost-cutting measures were introduced to later Rev. 2's such as removing the engraved buttons and adding the drum names to the front panel, removing the sync input jack and sync output knob from the back of the machine (the current quantize setting became the default sync output rate), removing the low volume stereo outputs, decreasing the size of the play/stop button, and replacing the raised buttons with sealed buttons (flush with the surface) that were impossible to clean. In fact, the LM-1 service notes indicated these buttons had to be replaced if they went bad. Influence. Because of the Linn LM-1's versatility, it superseded its intended purpose as an accompaniment tool and became a fully-fledged rhythm section for many synthpop and progressive acts. Along with the Roland TR-808, which was released around the same time, it is widely credited with legitimizing drum machines which, with a few notable exceptions, had previously largely been considered toys by most professional, mainstream musicians. It was thought for a time that the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of business, and caused enough of a stir that many leading session drummers (such as Jeff Porcaro of Toto, for example) went out and purchased their own drum machines and offered ""programming"" services (Porcaro used an LM-1 on George Benson's 1982 hit ""Turn Your Love Around""). The first song featuring an LM-1 to hit #1 on the UK pop chart was the Human League's ""Don't You Want Me"", in late 1981. It is also the first LM-1 track to top the US Billboard Hot 100, spending four weeks there in July 1982. Rose Royce's ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" released on November 11, 1978 made heavy use of the LM-1 and made the top US 40. In some ways the most important and lasting of the LM-1's various features is its sounds, which remain powerful and characteristic and a familiar staple of 1980s pop music. Linn acknowledged that his lack of audio engineering know-how may have contributed to his drum machine's unique sound - many of the samples contain playback frequencies above the Nyquist frequency which, although it results in aliasing under normal circumstances, contributes much to the ""sizzle"" of the LM-1's sound. [http://www.synthmuseum.com/linn/linlm101.html] Linn introduced the successor to his revolutionary machine in 1982. The LinnDrum often erroneously called the LM-2 (LM-1 stood for Linn/Moffett/1 and Moffett wasn't with the company by the time the LinnDrum came around), contained more sounds (including cymbals), more options for programming sounds (step programming mode), and 5 programmable trigger inputs, but was a step back from the LM-1 in that it removed the ability to tune all of the individual drum sounds (hi-hat, bass, cowbell, tambourine, sidestick, and many other sounds were no longer tunable). It retailed for $2,500 less than the original LM-1 and although it added some additional features, the cost-cutting measures were quite notable. Although the LinnDrum helped make electronic drums more affordable for the common musician, they are still not as revered as the LM-1 and generally can be found on the used market for much less. In 2013 the Linneapolis VST was released with emulation of the Linn LM-1 complete with Prince sounds. "
wikipedia-3973461," Coniferyl alcohol  Coniferyl alcohol is an organic compound. This colourless crystalline solid is a phytochemical, one of the monolignols. It is synthethized via the phenylpropanoid biochemical pathway. When copolymerized with related aromatic compounds, coniferyl alcohol forms lignin or lignans. Coniferin is a glucoside of coniferyl alcohol. Coniferyl alcohol is an intermediate in biosynthesis of eugenol and of stilbenoids and coumarin. Gum benzoin contains significant amount of coniferyl alcohol and its esters. It is found in both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.

wikipedia-3973527," Skyshield  Skyshield is a short range air defence system developed by the Swiss corporation Oerlikon Contraves.  __NOTOC__ Air-defence system. Skyshield Air-defence system is a modular, light weight, Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) system developed by the Swiss corporation Oerlikon Contraves (now a subsidiary of Rheinmetall of Germany). The successor to the Skyguard defense system, Skyshield is intended to rapidly acquire and destroy threatening aircraft and missiles.  The weapons system itself consists of two 35 mm (1.38 inch) Revolver Cannons with a rate of fire of 1,000 rounds per minute, a Fire Control System made up of a sensor unit and a detached command post. The Skyshield can also use up to two surface-to-air missile 8-cell modules for an expanded air defense capability. The Skyshield is designed for traditional anti-aircraft roles in addition to defense against missiles (see Anti-ballistic missile). The Skyshield is easily deployed by trucks and other transportation systems. The fire control system (FCS) uses an X-band search and tracking radar, and another unit for radar/TV and/or Laser/FLIR precision tracking. The command post can be placed up to 500 meters, roughly, from the fire control unit (FCU), using encrypted radio-waves. The Skyshield system can also be networked with other air defense systems for wider and more effective air coverage, expanding its roles from point defense to area defense. A modified and improved version of Skyshield with six fully automated turrets, dubbed MANTIS (Modular, Automatic and Network capable Targeting and Interception System) has been ordered by the German Army as a stationary base defence system. Two systems will be delivered between 2011 and 2012, with more orders being planned as a part of German Army's future ""SysFla"" air defence program. "
wikipedia-3973592," Eastern Virginia Medical School  Eastern Virginia Medical School commonly referred to as EVMS, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States is a public-private medical school founded by grassroots efforts in the southeastern part of Virginia known as Hampton Roads. Unlike the other public medical schools in Virginia, EVMS is not affiliated with an undergraduate institution and coordinates training through multiple medical centers in the Hampton Roads region. The school is dedicated solely to graduate biomedical and health education. The EVMS campus includes the 555-bed Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, the region's only tertiary level 1 trauma medical care facility, and the 212-bed Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters, a regional pediatric referral care facility and only stand alone children's hospital in the state. EVMS is the first institution in the US to have produced a viable fetus through in vitro fertilization. EVMS is most known for its reproductive medicine, simulation/standardized-patient education as well as research in pediatrics, geriatrics, diabetes, and cancer. In addition, EVMS is well known for it's leadership in community service and medical missions, as evidenced by faculty and alumni responsible for the founding of Operation Smile, Physicians for Peace, Global Brigades, and CONRAD. Approximately 5,000 applicants apply to the EVMS MD program every year for a total class size of 150. As a result, the EVMS MD program has an admission rate of 3% making it extremely competitive. The class size of the MD class of 2012 is 146 with 51% of the class as in-state and 49% as out-of-state. Following its commitment to train Hampton Roads residents, 21% of the entering class originated from Hampton Roads. On January 10, 2013, it was announced that Harry Lester was to step down as president and would be succeeded by the school's dean and provost, Richard V. Homan, MD effective April 15, 2013. Homan currently serves jointly as the school's president, dean of the medical school and provost. Eastern Virginia Medical School's MD Program is currently ranked 44th in Best Medical Schools: Primary Care by US News & World Report. Its Physician Assistant Program is ranked 25th in the nation. History. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson remarked that Norfolk would be an ideal location for a medical school branch of his alma mater, The College of William & Mary, albeit for its less than desirable climate. He wrote “No sir, Richmond is no place to furnish subjects for clinical lectures. I have always had Norfolk in view for this purpose. The climate and Pontine country around Norfolk render it truly sickly in itself.” However, this early conception would not come to fruition. In the 1960s the metropolitan area of Southeastern Virginia known as Hampton Roads recognized that the region did not have enough physicians to support its growing population. In an attempt to close the gap, area leaders decided to found a regional medical school, to both attract physicians from outside areas and to produce ""home-grown"" practitioners. It was thought that a University medical center operating in conjunction with previously operating regional health care facilities would effectively end the shortage and more importantly, bring a bevy of experts and specialists to the area. The idea gained the support of the Virginia General Assembly and the city councils of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk and Virginia Beach. In 1964, the General Assembly authorized the formation of what was then known as the Norfolk Area Medical Center Authority.  In 1970 fundraising by the EVMS foundation began the collection of funds for the creation of EVMS. Before acceptance of its first class, more than $17 million had been donated from community and business leaders. In 1973, Eastern Virginia Medical School accepted its first class. The following year, the EVMS Office of Graduate Medical Education was established to coordinate residency and fellowship training programs. EVMS has since graduated its 30th class of physicians, with one in four of all local physicians having some connection to the University and, additionally has produced many other medical professionals to satisfy the ever-growing need for health care workers. In the spring of 2008, the Commonwealth of Virginia approved appropriating capital outlay funds to EVMS to allow it to increase its doctoral student enrollment by 30% and its physician assistant program by 60%. When this expansion is completed, the total student enrollment will rise to approximately 1,000. Throughout its history, the merger of the school with nearby Old Dominion University or The College of William and Mary has been raised but never carried out. Both of these universities had joint programs with EVMS throughout its history. In 2007 EVMS and ODU created a formal cooperation agreement to share resources strategically in hopes of attracting strong faculty and obtaining grants. However, on July 25, 2012, EVMS made a joint announcement with The College of William & Mary that the two schools are considering merging so that EVMS would become the William & Mary School of Medicine. Any such merger would have to be confirmed by the two schools and then confirmed by the Virginia General Assembly and the Governor. A pilot relationship, supported by $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, was subsequently agreed upon by both universities to examine this possible union in reality. Campus. Eastern Virginia Medical Campus Eastern Virginia Medical School is located in Norfolk, VA, near downtown and the historic neighborhood of Ghent. The school is part of the Eastern Virginia Medical Center, which also includes the afformentioned hospitals and affiliated satellite buildings, along with a ""Medical Tower,"" that has many private practice medical offices. The Center is bounded by Colley Avenue, Brambleton Avenue, Hampton Boulevard, and Redgate Avenue. The Tide light-rail system connects the campus with downtown Norfolk and points east to the Virginia Beach city line. The campus facilities include: Auxiliary Campus Sites Although students and residents primarily rotate through the Eastern Virginia Medical Campus facilities, they will occasionally be positioned in one of the many affiliated or community hospitals. These institutions are listed below.  Academics. Eastern Virginia Medical School offers a wide variety of medical programs including: Graduate medical education. Fully accredited residencies at EVMS include: Fully accredited fellowships at EVMS include: -Adult Fellowships- -Pediatric Fellowships- Major research centers. The George L. Wright Jr. Proteomics Lab, a leader in the field, is now housed within this new center for cancer research. The center also includes a Biorepository that collects, processes and stores biological specimens and associated data. The Biorepository currently has 70,000 human samples available. The center is named in honor of Norfolk lawyer, community leader and philanthropist Leroy T. ""Buddy"" Canoles Jr. One of only a handful in the country that integrates task trainers, computerized manikins, virtual interfaces and standardized patients (people trained to portray patients) to create more realistic training scenarios. The new center incorporates the preexisting Theresa A. Thomas Professional Skills Teaching and Assessment Center, which helped pioneer the use of standardized patient education. In addition, a 3-D Virtual Reality lab known as ""The Cave"" is under construction. This system allows physicians and those in training to simulate real-life medical and physiological situations in an interactive/immersive, computer-based arena. As a Division of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Jones Institute, CONRAD is one of the campuses leading research organizations. The group recently was awarded a $100 million grant for work on Microbicides, which are products in development that will eventually come in a variety of forms (such as topical gels, creams, tablets, films and pills) to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and potentially other sexually transmitted infections. As described above, the Jones Institute was the first American body to perform In Vitro Fertilization. It continues today to further reproductive and endocrine research. As a leader in research for Diabetes, the Strelitz Diabetes Center has made several important findings. Dr Aaron Vinik, one of the leading researchers in the field, discovered the importance of INGAP gene, which plays a role on pancreatic insulin cell regeneration.  Staffed by several EVMS physicians and scientists, this organization strives to educate health professionals in the discipline of sleep medicine, seeking to improve the quality of life and health of patients who suffer from sleep-related disorders. Several sleep-labs scattered throughout the region allow practitioners to evaluate, treat and research these afflictions. Established in 2012 with a $3 million gift from Macon and Joan Brock, founders of Dollar Tree Inc., the institute serves as a center for interdisciplinary collaboration for both community and global health outreach. It will bring experts, faculty and students together to further the mission of the school and that is to be the most community oriented medical school in the nation. Karen Remley, MD, MBA, the former Virginia Health Commissioner, will serve as the founding director of the institute starting on March 18, 2013. Governance. As EVMS has a unique public/private structure unlike most schools in Virginia, the structure of the Board of Visitors is also unique.  As part of the 2008 Virginia General Assembly session, a compromise was reached in order to include EVMS in Governor Tim Kaine's $1.43 Billion bond to finance renovation and construction at Virginia's universities, state colleges, and government facilities. In the compromise, EVMS would allow seven of its Board of Visitors to be appointed by the Governor, House, and Senate of Virginia in order to meet the definition of a public university which some state legislators did not believe EVMS currently fit. Local health initiatives. The vision of Eastern Virginia Medical School has been plainly stated to be ""recognized as the most community-oriented medical school in the nation."" This is largely a product of the school's founding principles and origins; fostered by way of cooperation between the individual localities of Hampton Roads, the ultimate goal was to have more ""home-grown"" physicians. It is also echoed in the school's mission statement and numerous community activities, outreach programs and educational opportunities.  A completely free clinic housed within the Norfolk Public Health Building, the HOPES clinic is staffed entirely by volunteer students, resident-physicians and local clinicians. The H.O.P.E.S. Started in early 2011 by several EVMS students, it the first free clinic of its kind in the state, and the only one in Norfolk offering free services. All costs associated with the clinic are covered through private donations from local businesses, organizations, individuals and students. A locally run system of winter shelters for the homeless, EVMS students and resident-physicians have long helped staff the shelters of this organization. The physicians-in-training often set up health screenings during this time, helping assess for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension within these homeless populations. Those screened are then oft referred to local free or reduced-fee clinics for treatment. Beyond Clinic Walls (BCW) pairs interdisciplinary student teams with older adults facing complex medical and social challenges. Student teams make home visits every two weeks to their assigned client for the duration of the academic year. Student teams work collaboratively, with each team member contributing their discipline’s unique insight, to help clients maintain their independence and quality of life. BCW provides the organizational structure, resources, and continuity of care to foster and support the development of rich and meaningful relationships between student volunteers and older adults. Sightsavers is a nonprofit organization devoted to restore the sight of blind people, provide medical care to prevent blindness, and promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. The very active chapter at EVMS provides glaucoma screenings frequently throughout the community. Global health initiatives. In addition to being very involved in the local healthcare of Hampton Roads, EVMS has a longstanding commitment to global health education. The school offers many different opportunities for students to engage in community service abroad. Individuals who are pursuing a degree in public health are given the opportunity to do their research thesis abroad in several locations. The purpose of the projects is to give the individual students a unique perspective on how to do public health research projects in developing countries. The MPH department at EVMS has two established locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru. The research and service projects serves to help provide healthcare to the communities that have developed in areas where few services exist. Students and faculty from all health professions embark annually on medical missions to Peru, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mission is to bring medication and healthcare services to various rural communities. In partnership with local organizations with EVMS roots, students can also participate in medical missions with Operation Smile and Physicians for Peace. The Global Health Coalition is an umbrella organization dedicated to increasing awareness, knowledge and interest in international health through strategic coordination of global health related student organizations and activities at EVMS. GHC sponsors events and speakers on a number of international health topics, and facilitates the participation of EVMS students in international health internships and activities. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) is an independent not-for-profit organization helping to lead the improvement of health care throughout the world. The IHI is a reliable source of energy, knowledge, and support for a never-ending campaign to improve health care worldwide. Founded in 1991 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, IHI works to accelerate improvement by building the will for change, cultivating promising concepts for improving patient care, and helping health care systems put those ideas into action. The group aims to improve the lives of patients, the health of communities, and the joy of the health care workforce by focusing on an ambitious set of goals adapted from the Institute of Medicine's six improvement aims for the health care system: Safety, Effectiveness, Patient-Centeredness, Timeliness, Efficiency, and Equity. Community service organizations. In addition to serving the community with several medically oriented groups, EVMS students and faculty are very active in general service. EVMS students began collecting new and used coats through Coats for Kids—formerly Operation Overcoat—in 1987. Coats for Kids distributes thousands of coats each year to the area's needy children. WAVY-TV is media sponsor of Coats for Kids. Albano Cleaners dry clean all the donated coats and distribute them among the distribution sites. EVMS is a drop off site as well as a distribution site. Three times each winter the EVMS students volunteer and give out coats to those who need them. As part of the community oriented tradition at EVMS, students get together to redesign Lewis Hall into a Haunted Hallway for the neighborhood children. Families from the surrounding neighborhoods are shuttled in and can enjoy an array of games, crafts and haunted mazes. The intent is to provide a safe and open space for children and their families to spend the night Trick or Treating. Student organizations and interest groups. The AMA-MSS is dedicated to representing medical students, improving medical education, developing leadership, and promoting activism for the health of America. The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), with more than a half-century history of medical student activism, is the oldest and largest independent association of physicians-in-training in the United States. Founded in 1950, AMSA is a student-governed, non-profit organization committed to representing the concerns of physicians-in-training. AMSA began under the auspices of the American Medical Association (AMA) to provide medical students a chance to participate in organized medicine. Starting in 1960, the association refocused its energies on the problems of the medically underserved, inequities in our health-care system and related issues in medical education. Since 1968, AMSA has been a fully independent student organization. With approximately 50,000 members, including medical and premedical students, residents and practicing physicians, AMSA is committed to improving medical training as well as advancing the profession of medicine. AMSA focuses on four strategic priorities, including universal healthcare, disparities in medicine, diversity in medicine and transforming the culture of medical education. Today, AMSA continues its commitment to improving medical training and the nation's health. This student group was formed to bring together students and provide a safe and open space at EVMS to discuss LGBT issues, especially topics related to health care. Each year, the group does presentations for the other medical interest groups to help bring LGBT awareness to other students as they pursue their medical school training. Student traditions. Every year during the fall semester, the first and second year medical school classes get together to play a game of football where the female students compete and male students are on the sidelines cheering. Games are refereed by the third and fourth medical school classes, which always makes each year's game interesting. Traditionally, the second year students beat the first years. Several Fridays throughout the year, EVMS will fund a social outing providing food and often entertainment for the students, residents and faculty at either a local restaurant or on school grounds. A tradition dating back to the school's early years, this tradition is designed to help promote collegiality and provide stress relief throughout the difficult times of medical education. The tradition initially involved alcoholic beverages, however these were removed when they were no longer allowed on campus. To mark the official entrance into the medical community and the beginning of a medical student's education, each first year medical and physician assistant student is ""coated"" by an attending physician of EVMS. The ceremony usually ends with the reciting of the Hippocratic Oath. To signify the transition of the short white coat of the medical student to that of the full-length coat of the physician, the original short coats are burned in a ceremony similar to that of an American Flag being retired from service. This tradition began as an informal, student-run activity, simply referred to as the ""White Coat Burning."" However, in 2010, the Office of Alumni Relations formalized and expanded the celebration as a means to welcome the graduating class into the Alumni Association. The ceremony won the 2011 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Award of Excellence for being a ""new take on an old tradition"".' Just as the rest of the nation's medical school students find out what residency program they are to join, EVMS celebrates its ""Match Day"" on the third Friday of March (previously third Thursday of March). However, unique to EVMS is a long-standing tradition of dressing up in costume based on a varying yearly theme. Examples of past themes have included ""Plan B,"" ""Heroes and Villains,"" and ""Rock Stars."" Economic impact. In a 2007 study conducted by Old Dominion University, EVMS was found to not only be important for the region's physical health, but also among the greatest economic influences on the region. The study found the following: Notable faculty and graduates. Faculty Graduates "

wikipedia-3973669," Plastic bending  Plastic bending is a nonlinear behaviour peculiar to members made of ductile materials that frequently achieve much greater ultimate bending strength than indicated by a linear elastic bending analysis. In both the plastic and elastic bending analyses of a straight beam, it is assumed that the strain distribution is linear about the neutral axis (plane sections remain plane). In an elastic analysis this assumption leads to a linear stress distribution but in a plastic analysis the resulting stress distribution is nonlinear and is dependent on the beam’s material. The limiting plastic bending strength formula_1 (see Plastic moment)can generally be thought of as an upper limit to a beam’s load–carrying capability as it only represents the strength at a particular cross–section and not the load–carrying capability of the overall beam. A beam may fail due to global or local instability before formula_1 is reached at any point on its length. Therefore, beams should also be checked for local buckling, local crippling, and global lateral–torsional buckling modes of failure. Note that the deflections necessary to develop the stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently to the point of incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations. Plastic bending occurs when an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a cross-section to exceed the material's yield strength. Loaded with only a moment, the peak bending stresses occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section. The cross-section will not yield simultaneously through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the neutral axis is the same as the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section). After a structural member reaches a sufficiently high condition of plastic bending, it acts as a Plastic hinge. Elementary Elastic Bending theory requires that bending stress varies linearly with distance from the neutral axis, but plastic bending shows a more accurate and complex stress distribution. The yielded areas of the cross-section will vary somewhere between the yield and ultimate strength of the material. In the elastic region of the cross-section, the stress distribution varies linearly from the neutral axis to the beginning of the yielded area. Predicted failure occurs when the stress distribution approximates the material's stress-strain curve. The largest value being that of the ultimate strength. Not every area of the cross-section will have exceeded the yield strength.  As in the basic Elastic Bending theory, the moment at any section is equal to an area integral of bending stress across the cross-section. From this and the above additional assumptions, predictions of deflections and failure strength are made. Plastic theory was validated at the beginning of the last century by C. v. Bach. See also.

wikipedia-3973724," Digimon Data Squad  Digimon Data Squad, known in Japan as , is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation (who worked on the Sunbow Productions animated series based on Hasbro properties), serving as the fifth series in the ""Digimon"" franchise, the first to be produced in four years following 2002's ""Digimon Frontier"". The series aired in Japan on Fuji TV between April 2, 2006 and March 25, 2007. An English-language version was produced by Studiopolis in conjunction with Toei Animation USA and Disney Enterprises and aired in North America on Jetix (and subsequently Disney XD) between October 1, 2007 and November 1, 2008. It aired in the United Kingdom on Kix!. A movie based on the series was released in Japan on December 9, 2006. The series was later succeeded by ""Digimon Fusion"". Production. Digimon Savers was first announced during the December of 2005 Jump Festa convention in Japan with advertisements showing a remolded Agumon as the lead Digimon. The name of the series was later revealed in January 2005 with the character designs coming a month later. Savers was the first Digimon series to be produced in nearly four years, but the second Digimon production since 2005, coming off the heels of Digital Monster X-Evolution, where staff had mentioned early on that a new series might be possible depending on its performance. Unlike previous series which all featured human character designs by Akihiro Asanuma, Savers went with designs by Sayo Aoi that featured designs more typical of anime than the staple style of shows past. The series was aired as a family program rather than a children's program in an attempt to capture a wider audience, including those who might have watched the earlier shows but grown older. Because of this new market, this series also contains the oldest cast of main characters, ranging from late teens to early twenties. Rather than the typical eight-month wait between the Japanese airing and the English dub, there was a full eighteen months between the dub and the Japanese airing. Not long after the discovery of an entry for the show on Toei's website, which featured anglicized names for some of the characters and the show's new English title, chosen by Toei, on April 25, 2007, Disney's ABC Network announced that it had signed an agreement with Toei Animation to license the show. Much of the staff that worked on ""Digimon Adventure"", including director Jeff Nimoy, returned to work on ""Data Squad"". Because Disney had the rights to the show outside of Asia, it was aired in different channels throughout the world than past incarnations. Bandai, in order to grab the older Digimon fans, wanted the reappearance of a Digimon from the old series, which was chosen to be the original main Digimon, Agumon. Plot summary. A 14-year-old boy, Marcus Damon, an undefeated ultimate fighter (street fighter in the original Japanese version), meets Agumon, who has escaped from DATS, a secret government organization set up to defend the human world from invading wild Digimon. After fighting each other, the two quickly become friends, and through a series of events, are inducted into DATS, where they hope to grow in strength. Marcus' team-mates include 14-year-old Thomas H. Norstein, a young prodigy, with his partner Gaomon, and 18-year-old Yoshino ""Yoshi"" Fujieda who has Lalamon for her partner. As the series progresses, Thomas discovers that Digimon respond to the ""darkness"" in humans, putting them at odds with monsters who seek to use humanity's own vices to bolster their own power. The plot thickens with the introduction of Merukimon, one of the rulers (as a member of the Olympus Twelve, Merukimon has a god status in the Digital World), of the Digital World who rules the eastern Digital World and lives in the Infinite Ice Ridge, Biyomon and the human boy Keenan Krier, who serves him along with his partner Falcomon. The DATS team tries to unfold the reason for their hatred of humankind, until it is revealed that the real enemy was Akihiro Kurata, a scientist who led an attack on the Digital World years before that resulted in the death of many Digimon, including Keenan's adoptive mother, Frigimon. Kurata gained the support of the Japanese government and important businessmen like Thomas' father on his plan to destroy all Digimon in the Digital World, claiming they were a threat to mankind. But this was only a facade to occult his main objective. He harnesses the energy of the Digimon he destroyed to power-up Belphemon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon/Seven Great Demon Lords, and uses it in his attempt to rule the Human World (and eventually the Digital World), but his ambitions were shattered by the efforts of Marcus and his allies. Kurata's last act was triggering a bomb which collapsed the frontier between the Human and Digital Worlds, putting both en route on collision, which could have led to the destruction of both realms. The collision was halted by the desperate efforts of BanchoLeomon who ordered Marcus to search for Yggdrasil/King Drasil, the Supreme Ruler and God of the Digital World. When the DATS team finally met King Drasil, they discovered that his decision to deal with the crisis unfolded, was to protect the Digital World by destroying the Human World, as the two worlds could not coexist in the same dimension. To perform this task, he assembled his elite guard, the Royal Knights. Marcus was confused at first because King Drasil somehow had the appearance of his father, Dr. Spencer Damon, who disappeared in the Digital World years before. But it was revealed that King Drasil took his father's body, and his soul was somehow preserved by BanchoLeomon, who was revealed to be Spencer's partner Digimon. After defeating some of the Royal Knights, the DATS team decided to confront King Drasil himself, who after being expelled from Spencer's body, transformed himself into an all-powerful robotic form determined to destroy the Human World by itself. However, even when the Royal Knights rebel against King Drasil, it won't give up its goal, attempting to destroy both worlds and create a new world. Using their emotions, Marcus and Agumon finally defeat King Drasil, and the two worlds cease their collision course. Before disappearing, King Drasil brings Spencer back to life and he returns to his family, but the Digimon decide to return to the Digital World to help restore it, and in the end Marcus decides to not part with Agumon and goes with them. 5 years later, Keenan and Kristy, Marcus' sister, go to the same school together. Thomas finally managed to find a cure for his sister's illness and became the youngest scientist to win the Nobel Prize at age 19. Yoshi has joined the police with the remaining DATS members, and Marcus and Agumon have become peacekeepers in the Digital World, breaking up fighting between rival Digimon factions as seen when stopping an argument between a group of Goblimon and Shamanmon. Media. Anime. Digimon Savers aired 48 episodes on Fuji TV in Japan from April 2, 2006 to March 25, 2007. In Germany, the series first aired on RTL 2 from November 30, 2007 to February 14, 2008. Digimon Data Squad finished airing in the US on Jetix on November 1, 2008, 13 months after premiering on the October 1, 2007. In Brazil, twenty episodes have aired on Rede Globo, since August 10, 2009. After that, the series was no longer broadcast. In Latin America (including Brazil), the anime premiered on Disney XD on February 22, 2010. Since Monday 15 March, Digimon Data Squad finally began airing in the United Kingdom on Kix! (Only on Sky and FreeSat). Since then, it continually airs every day at 7am, 1pm and 4pm throughout the day, however since ""Pinky and the Brain"" premiered it is only shown at 7am, 09:30am, 11:30am and 3:30pm. It was announced on February 12, 2009 that Toei Animation has signed Well Go USA instead of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment with the DVD rights to Digimon Data Squad, and the first thirteen US sub and dub episodes has been made available on May 26, 2009. The first DVD showed the North American edited TV version as seen on Disney XD. The second DVD set was available on May 25, 2010, this set will also feature promo videos for the series. There are no uncut DVDs (outside of Japan and Brazil). The release of the third DVD set is unknown. Madman Entertainment have released all 48 episodes across four sets on Region 4 DVD in Australia and New Zealand with only the US English Edited TV dub by Studiopolis. Brazil had released several DVDS of the show. It's unknown whether New Video Group had obtained the rights to release the season on DVD. Video games. As it is part of a resurgence of the Digimon franchise, Digimon Data Squad has a number of related video games associated with it. "

wikipedia-3973736," Corneal dystrophy  Corneal dystrophy is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by bilateral abnormal deposition of substances in the transparent front part of the eye called the cornea.  Pathophysiology. A corneal dystrophy can be caused by an accumulation of extraneous material in the cornea, including lipids and cholesterol crystals. Signs and symptoms. Corneal dystrophy may not significantly affect vision in the early stages. However, it does require proper evaluation and treatment for restoration of optimal vision. Corneal dystrophies usually manifest themselves during the first or second decade but sometimes later. It appears as grayish white lines, circles, or clouding of the cornea. Corneal dystrophy can also have a crystalline appearance. There are over 20 corneal dystrophies that affect all parts of the cornea. These diseases share many traits: Corneal dystrophies affect vision in widely differing ways. Some cause severe visual impairment, while a few cause no vision problems and are diagnosed during a specialized eye examination by an ophthalmologist. Other dystrophies may cause repeated episodes of pain without leading to permanent loss of vision.  Diagnosis. Diagnosis can be established on clinical grounds and this may be enhanced with studies on surgically excised corneal tissue and in some cases with molecular genetic analyses. As clinical manifestations widely vary with the different entities, corneal dystrophies should be suspected when corneal transparency is lost or corneal opacities occur spontaneously, particularly in both corneas, and especially in the presence of a positive family history or in the offspring of consanguineous parents.  Superficial corneal dystrophies - ""Meesmann dystrophy"" is characterized by distinct tiny bubble-like, punctate opacities that form in the central corneal epithelium and to a lesser extent in the peripheral cornea of both eyes during infancy that persists throughout life. Symmetrical reticular opacities form in the superficial central cornea of both eyes at about 4–5 years of age in ""Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy"". Patient remains asymptomatic until epithelial erosions precipitate acute episodes of ocular hyperemia, pain, and photophobia. Visual acuity eventually becomes reduced during the second and third decades of life following a progressive superficial haze and an irregular corneal surface.In ""Thiel-Behnke dystrophy"", sub-epithelial corneal opacities form a honeycomb-shaped pattern in the superficial cornea. Multiple prominent gelatinous mulberry-shaped nodules form beneath the corneal epithelium during the first decade of life in ""Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy"" which cause photophobia, tearing, corneal foreign body sensation and severe progressive loss of vision. ""Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy"" is characterized by feather shaped opacities and microcysts in the corneal epithelium that are arranged in a band-shaped and sometimes whorled pattern. Painless blurred vision sometimes begins after sixty years of life.  Corneal stromal dystrophies - ""Macular corneal dystrophy"" is manifested by a progressive dense cloudiness of the entire corneal stroma that usually first appears during adolescence and eventually causing severe visual impairment. In ""Granular corneal dystrophy"" multiple small white discrete irregular spots that resemble bread crumbs or snowflakes become apparent beneath Bowman zone in the superficial central corneal stroma. They initially appear within the first decade of life. Visual acuity is more or less normal. ""Lattice dystrophy"" starts as fine branching linear opacities in Bowman's layer in the central area and spreads to the preiphery. Recurrent corneal erosions may occur. The hallmark of ""Schnyder corneal dystrophy"" is the accumulation of crystals within the corneal stroma which cause corneal clouding typically in a ring-shaped fashion. Posterior corneal dystrophies - ""Fuchs corneal dystrophy"" presents during the fifth or sixth decade of life. The characteristic clinical findings are excrescences on a thickened Descemet membrane (cornea guttae), generalized corneal edema and decreased visual acuity. In advanced cases, abnormalities are found in the all layers of the cornea. In ""posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy"" small vesicles appear at the level of Descemet membrane. Most patients remain asymptomatic and corneal edema is usually absent. ""Congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy"" is characterized by a diffuse ground-glass appearance of both corneas and markedly thickened (2–3 times thicker than normal) corneas from birth or infancy. Differential diagnosis. Main differential diagnosis include various causes of monoclonal gammopathy, lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase deficiency, Fabry disease, cystinosis, tyrosine transaminase deficiency, systemic lysosomal storage diseases, and several skin diseases (X-linked ichthyosis, keratosis follicularis spinolosa decalvans). Historically, an accumulation of small gray variable shaped punctate opacities of variable shape in the central deep corneal stroma immediately anterior to Descemet membrane were designated deep filiform dystrophy and cornea farinata because of their resemblance to commas, circles, lines, threads (filiform), flour (farina) or dots. These abnormalities are now known to accompany X-linked ichthyosis ,steroid sulfatase deficiency, caused by steroid sulfatase gene mutations and are currently usually not included under the rubric of the corneal dystrophies.  In the past, the designation vortex corneal dystrophy (corneal verticillata) was applied to a corneal disorder characterized by the presence of innumerable tiny brown spots arranged in curved whirlpool-like lines in the superficial cornea. An autosomal dominant mode of transmission was initially suspected, but later it was realized that these individuals were affected hemizygous males and asymptomatic female carriers of an X-linked systemic metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase, known as Fabry disease.  Classification. Corneal dystrophies are commonly subdivided depending on its specific location within the cornea. It can be basically divided into ""anterior"", ""stromal"", or ""posterior"" according to the layer of the cornea affected by the dystrophy. The following classification is by Klintworth: Superficial dystrophies: Stromal dystrophies: Posterior dystrophies: Treatment. Early stages may be asymptomatic and may not require any intervention. Initial treatment may include hypertonic eyedrops and ointment to reduce the corneal edema and may offer symptomatic improvement prior to surgical intervention.  Suboptimal vision caused by corneal dystrophy usually requires surgical intervention in the form of corneal transplantation. Penetrating keratoplasty, a common type of corneal transplantation, is commonly performed for extensive corneal dystrophy. With penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant), the long term results are good-excellent. Recent surgical improvements have been made which have increased the success rate for this procedure. However, recurrence of the disease in the donor graft may happen. Superficial corneal dystrophies do not need a penetrating keratoplasty as the deeper corneal tissue is unaffected, therefore a lamellar keratoplasty may be used instead. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) can be used to excise or ablate the abnormal corneal tissue. Patients with superficial corneal opacities are suitable candidates for a this procedure. Genetics. Different corneal dystrophies are caused by mutations in the CHST6, KRT3, KRT12, PIP5K3, SLC4A11, TACSTD2, TGFBI, and UBIAD1 genes. Mutations in TGFB1 which encodes ""transforming growth factor beta"" cause several forms of corneal dystrophies including granular corneal dystrophy, lattice corneal dystrophy, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy, and Thiel-Behnke dystrophy. Corneal dystrophies may have a simple autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or rarely X-linked recessive Mendelian mode of inheritance: "

wikipedia-3973859," Gécamines  Gécamines, or La Générale des Carrières et des Mines, is a state-owned mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Its principal products are copper (for which Katanga is well known, and which often accounted for 50% of export earnings), cobalt and zinc. Additional minerals mined include uranium. History. Gécamines is the successor to the Union Minière du Haut Katanga. On December 31, 1966, the Congolese government, under dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, took over the UMHK, an immensely profitable Belgian mining trust founded on 1906, and transformed it into a state-owned firm, Gécamines. From that point onwards the company's fortunes declined, as did those of the rest of the country (between 1965 and 1987, Congolese GDP per head fell by 2.4%). The Mobutu regime has been accused of theft of the nation's financial and physical treasure. For example, one Gécamines official estimated theft to amount to 10% of production.(citation needed). During Mobutu's presidency, Gecamines' fortunes have declined, and they are now are seeking to enter partnerships with other firms to avoid bankruptcy (Citation needed.) Nonetheless, the company remained crucial to Congolese finance: In 1989, Gécamines provided 85% of DR Congo's export earnings (against 60% provided by the UMHK in 1960), and 42% of public revenues, making it by far the most important company in the country. In the 1990s, Gécamines' financial situation took a blow, adversely affected by several issues, including the ageing of infrastructure and equipment, collapse of the mine of Kamoto, and ethnic riots in Shaba. These led to a slump in production, as can be seen in the copper production chart below. Operations. Production of copper, by year. Despite these unfortunate figures, it must be remembered that Gécamines is still in possession of proven, probable, and possible ore reserves of copper (56 Mt contained metal), cobalt (4 Mt), and germanium (3.4 Mt), and zinc (6.4 Mt). With assistance from the World Bank, aided by partnerships with other firms and by proper governance in DR Congo, Gécamines hopes to resume its former copper production. "
wikipedia-3973930," Electrophoretic mobility shift assay  An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or mobility shift electrophoresis, also referred as a gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay, band shift assay, or gel retardation assay, is a common affinity electrophoresis technique used to study protein–DNA or protein–RNA interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension, and promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin and Fried and Crothers. Principle. A mobility shift assay is electrophoretic separation of a protein–DNA or protein–RNA mixture on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel for a short period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel). The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see gel electrophoresis). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly). Under the correct experimental conditions, the interaction between the DNA and protein is stabilized and the ratio of bound to unbound nucleic acid on the gel reflects the fraction of free and bound probe molecules as the binding reaction enters the gel. This stability is in part due to the low ionic strength of the buffer, but also due to a ""caging effect"", in that the protein, surrounded by the gel matrix, is unable to diffuse away from the probe before they recombine. If the starting concentrations of protein and probe are known, and if the stoichiometry of the complex is known, the apparent affinity of the protein for the nucleic acid sequence may be determined. The number derived is the apparent Kd as the true Kd cannot be determined from this type of assay because there is no equilibrium binding between the substrate complexes. If the protein concentration is not known but the complex stoichiometry is, the protein concentration can be determined by increasing the concentration of DNA probe until further increments do not increase the fraction of protein bound. By comparison with a set of standard dilutions of free probe run on the same gel, the number of moles of protein can be calculated. An antibody that recognizes the protein can be added to this mixture to create an even larger complex with a greater shift. This method is referred to as a ""supershift assay"", and is used to unambiguously identify a protein present in the protein – nucleic acid complex. Often, an extra lane is run with a competitor oligonucleotide to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition (not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics. Once DNA-protein binding is determined ""in vitro"", a number of ""in silico"" algorithms can narrow the search for identification of the transcription factor. Consensus sequence oligonucleotides for the transcription factor of interest will be able to compete for the binding, eliminating the shifted band, and must be confirmed by supershift. If the predicted consensus sequence fails to compete for binding, identification of the transcription factor may be aided by Multiplexed Competitor EMSA (MC-EMSA), whereby large sets of consensus sequences are multiplexed in each reaction, and where one set competes for binding, the individual consensus sequences from this set are run in a further reaction.  For visualization purposes, the nucleic acid fragment is usually labelled with a radioactive, fluorescent or biotin label. Standard ethidium bromide staining is less sensitive than these methods and can lack the sensitivity to detect the nucleic acid if small amounts are used in these experiments. When using a biotin label, streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase is used to detect the DNA fragment (Non-radioactive EMSA review). While isotopic DNA labeling has little or no effect on protein binding affinity, use of non-isotopic labels including flurophores or biotin can alter the affinity and/or stoichiometry of the protein interaction of interest. Competition between fluorophore- or biotin-labeled probe and unlabeled DNA of the same sequence can be used to determine whether the label alters binding affinity or stoichiometry. "
