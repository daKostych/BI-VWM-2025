wikipedia-3925334," Cubix  Cubix (Korean: 큐빅스; retitled 로보짱 큐빅스 for the KBS broadcast; subtitled Robots for Everyone in the United States) is a South Korean animated television series created by Cinepix. 4Kids Entertainment acquired the rights for an English adaption dub to the series in 2001, retaining them until their transfer to Saban Brands (a subsidiary of Saban Capital Group) in June 2012. Saban Brands currently owns and manages the copyright and branding of the English adaption of the series. Production. ""Cubix"" was created by the Korean company called Cinepix and licensed by 4Kids Entertainment in North America, and aired for two seasons during the Kids' WB! children’s block on The WB, lasting from August 11, 2001 to April 26, 2003; the series was later re-broadcast on FoxBox (owned by 4Kids Entertainment, later renamed 4KidsTV) from August 30, 2003 to January 2, 2005. Cubix is currently licensed by Saban Brands and aired on the Vortexx block on The CW, mainly to help provide their affiliates a half-hour of educational and informational programming credit. It was removed from the block after 4 weeks on September 22, 2012 and replaced with another episode of Rescue Heroes. Both seasons were broadcast in the UK on Cartoon Network UK. As of May 2010, the series is airing in the UK on kids' TV channel Pop. The show has been the theme of three video games: , , and . Many voice actors from this show also worked on the show, Pokemon. Plot and setting. ""Cubix"", set in the year 2044, is the story of a bright-eyed young boy named Connor with a deep fascination for robots. His father, Graham, who dislikes all robots, has never truly been supportive of Connor. As a surprise to his son, he purchases them a home and a small doughnut shop in the robot center of the world, Bubble Town, location of the RobixCorp headquarters. In this town, robots even outnumber people. The reason for RobixCorp's success is the EPU (Emotional Processing Unit), allowing robots to develop their own unique personality, just like a human being. Now that Connor's dream has finally come true, he finds himself with one great dilemma: everyone in Bubble Town owns a robot, that is, except him. Shortly after his arrival, he meets his nosy neighbor Abby who sends her little flying pet robot, Dondon, to spy on him and his dad. Graham, not being so fond of robots, conks Dondon over the head, knocking him out. A worried Abby, along with Connor, hop onto her hover scooter, rushing for the one place in town that can fix her friend: the Botties Pit. Operated by Hela, daughter of the famed inventor of the EPU and founder of RobixCorp, Professor Nemo, who has a special club for kids who can fix robots called 'The Botties', but to join, there's a test: you have to fix a robot in less than 24 hours. It is said that her father mysteriously vanished after an experiment with the highly volatile substance known as Solex. The members of the club include: Chip, his robot Cerebrix, Mong and Maximix, along with Abby and Dondon. Of all the robots he could have chosen to fix, Connor picks Cubix, a one-of-a-kind test model for the very first EPU. Unfortunately, they all called Cubix the 'Unfixable Robot' because at one time or another, they had all tried to repair him, especially Hela, who could never quite throw him out. After a sudden attack by Dr. K, an old colleague of Professor Nemo, who runs off with a stolen robot, the Botties' pit begins to crumble. But because of Connor's talent and thoughts projected into Cubix's EPU, he is brought back to life. Cubix then saves Connor from the collapse, proving that Connor could even fix the 'Unfixable Robot'. That wasn't the only surprise Cubix had in store; with his amazing design he can reconfigure and transform into virtually anything. Along with their new friends, Connor and Cubix face up against Dr. K to take back the kidnapped bot. This series follows the adventures and discoveries of the Botties gang, and their unraveling of Dr. K.'s crooked scheme along with the disappearance of Professor Nemo. Solex. Solex was said to have been discovered after an alien spacecraft crashed outside of RobixCorp, shortly before Prof. Nemo's disappearance. It has two forms: the glowing electric blue liquid form prone to random energy fluctuations and the second, more stable crystallized form used in most robots. The story suggests that it has a psychic nature as it reacts to sentient thoughts and emotions, even those of robot's EPUs. Solex in both liquid and crystallized form is capable of producing immense power. Solex in the 1st series. In the first season, Dr. K collects Solex from infected robots to utilize in his ultimate plan with the aid of the Alien, who uses the alter ego of Raska, the RobixCorp spokes model. It is suspected that the Solex was originally discovered by Professor Nemo but fearing the misuse of its power, separated the liquid Solex into small doses, placing them in random robots (or that the explosion in his lab the day he disappeared caused the Solex he was experimenting with to be transferred into the robots that were in his lab at the time). The liquid Solex, however, produces unexpected effects in robots; this is referred to as Solex infection. As the EPU is placed under heavy stress or emotions, the uncontrollable energy reaction of the liquid Solex causes them to malfunction and go berserk. Besides the behavioral malfunction, the infected robot also gains extreme power far beyond its normal capabilities. However, this extreme power could overload the host and cause self-destruction unless liquid Solex is removed, the robot is deactivated or the Solex energy returns to normal. Characters. The titular Cubix is a one of a kind robot built before Professor Nemo's disappearance, who is found deactivated with no visible damage, but no way to reactivate him either. He is introduced as part of Connor's initiation ceremony as the robot he chooses to fix. However, he cannot get Cubix to work until Dr. K appears to retrieve Solex from a robot. Connor brings Cubix back to life, just as the building they are in starts to crumble. His body is made out of a number of cubes, giving him a versatile modular function- by restructuring himself and using various gadgets within the cubes, he can transform into a hover bike, an airplane, a helicopter and plenty more. He can even fly without the need to transform into a vehicle. Hidden in each cube there is a different gadget with a solution to almost every dire situation. When it comes to fighting, Cubix is exceptionally strong, but often relies on his transformational ability and unorthodox strategies to win. He is powered by a generator that runs off crystallized Solex, which is rumored to be the ultimate power source, but nobody knows exactly how it works. Cubix's body is also constructed out of a highly resistant metal that is capable of withstanding devastating amounts of damage without breaking. He also has additional parts that when added to his structure can increase his strength. Cubix is a friendly and helpful robot, but lacks speech capability, while speaking seems to be common place among other robots. Usually he just repeats what people around him say, and uses the LED display where his eyes usually are to communicate emotions. However, later in the series this improves greatly and he becomes capable of forming sentences and dialogues, and once he regains the crystallized Solex at the finale, he regains the capacity for independent speech. Voiced by Scottie Ray. Humans. Botties. Connor: The main human character of the series, Connor is obsessed with robots. He moved to Bubble Town, and soon after joined the 'Botties' by fixing the 'Unfixable Robot', Cubix. Perpetually optimistic, yet kind of a hard head, he resents his dad for never answering questions about his late mother. He's best friends with Abby, as they often play 'virtual battle' video games at her house. Him and the Botties hang out at his dad's doughnut shop and Hela's repair shop, the Botties' Pitt. Voiced by Andrew Rannells. Abby: Connor's neighbor, best human friend, and fellow robot-lover, Abby was the first person to show Connor around Bubble Town. She's a member of the Botties and her pet robot, Dondon, has been her best friend since she was 6 years old. She's a little impatient and a bit of a procrastinator but she has a sweet compassionate side. Abby loves robots and looks up to Hela almost like a big sister, and secretly wishes to be just like her someday. She can often be found in her room studying robot repair manuals. Voiced by Veronica Taylor. Chip: He may be short but at only 10, he's probably the smartest of the Botties. He knows practically everything about robots. At times he can be a know-it-all who only sees things his way. He's actually very insecure about his height and can come across as awkward or nervous. His robot, Cerebrix is a specialized calculation model. He's best friends with Mong. Voiced by Amy Birnbaum. Mong: The taller and chunkier member of the Botties, Mong loves snacks and making jokes that only he ends up laughing at. He seems dense but he's actually pretty inventive and has a big heart. Highly competitive and a bit prideful, he rushes headlong into things, sometimes ignoring the consequences. His robot is Maximix, originally a fitness trainer model. Mong converted him into a motor bike. He's best friends with Chip. Voiced by Jimmy Zoppi. Hela Nemo: The daughter of Professor Nemo and the idol of Abby, she is the owner of the Botties Pit. Hela knows almost everything about robot repair. She's pretty even keeled, and is usually a source of advice and comfort to her young apprentices. Her robot team includes Diagnostix, Mr. Fixit, Ixpressive, and Attractix (named Kan-It). She also acts as a motherly figure to Connor and despite the arguments she has with his stubborn father it is joked about in the series that she likes him. Voiced by Rachael Lillis. Villains. Dr. K: The main villain of the series, Dr. K used to work for RobixCorp, but lost his arm in a lab explosion and now as a rogue robot inventor uses his smarts for evil. In Season 1 he's after a substance called Solex to build the ultimate robot and destroy Bubble Town. His main robot is Kolossal, but he has his own line of evil robots such as Katastrophe, Kannon, Krab, Klawber, and Kilobot. It is unclear what happened to Dr. K at the end of the series finale. Voiced by Maddie Blaustein. Raska: Bubble Town's most famous celebrity, Raska is the spokes model for RobixCorp. Raska does not have any robots of her own besides the Cinematixes that film her. Near the end of the season it is revealed that Raska is the alien from the spaceship that crashed outside RobixCorp, and (using her human disguise) became a member of Prof. Nemo's team (most likely in order to retrieve the Solex). Raska and Dr. K are shown to be in some sort of alliance in order to acquire Solex for their own goals. For most of the season, Raska's true alien form is only seen on Dr. K's screen when communicating with him and is kept in complete silhouette. Her true from is fully shown in the final two episodes. She only appears in the first season since in the final episode of the first season she is killed when Dr.K's giant robot is destroyed by Cubix. Human: Voiced by Megan Hollingshead, Alien: Voiced by Eric Stuart. Miscellaneous. Graham: Connor's dad, who owns and runs Bubble Town's most popular doughnut shop. He dislikes robots, especially the dysfunctional Waitrixes that work at his shop causing him continuous aggravation, yet he developed an exception for Cubix. He believes in good old manual labor and resents how robots have made people lazier over the years. He's a loving father, but has a hard time showing it. Sometimes he cannot quite express how he feels, particularly about his wife's death. This causes a bit of strain on his relationship with Connor. It is also hinted he has a crush on Hela. Voiced by Dan Green. Taryn: Connor's late mother, who supposedly died when he was younger. Connor keeps a picture of her in his room as a memory. Professor Nemo: The ultimate robotist, Professor Nemo was the one who built Cubix and invented the EPU. He disappeared in the aforementioned lab explosion caused by Solex, but was later found kidnapped by Dr. K. A giant sculpture of the Prof. stands in the grand hall of RobixCorp. He designed all of his robots with a yellow spiral. Also voiced by Dan Green. Charles: A spoiled brat and the richest kid in town. Charles is the son of the Mayor and his family has important connections, so he gets all the latest models from RobixCorp. His favorite robot, Quixtreme 5000, is a rare pre-release model given to him as a special birthday gift, that will not be on the market for 10 years! Called Cheetah for short, he can transform into a cherry red Rolls Royce hover car, a cheetah, and an armored battling robot. This makes Charles think he can gain entry into the Botties. It is implied that he has a bit of a crush on Abby and is jealous of Connor. He often follows them around, showing off. Voiced by Ted Lewis. Robots. Botties Robots. Maximix: Maximix is Mong's robot. Maximix has a unicycle propulsion instead of legs and is also capable of transforming into a Go-kart like vehicle to provide Mong with transportation. Although not as strong as Cubix or Kolossal, Maximix has proven himself to be a formidable opponent on several occasions. He can hold his own against Kolossal or any of Dr. K's robots. Thanks to his unicycle propulsion he can reach high speeds and is quite agile. His personality is similar to his master: hot headed, competitive and a little conceited, but always reliable. Maximix's voice is similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Voiced by Frank Frankson. Dondon: Dondon is Abby's pet robot. Dondon is a personal interaction and entertainment robot, outfitted with hovering capabilities allowing him to flutter about for indefinite periods of time. So, although he has wings they are more decorative. Being small and defenseless, Dondon is not a fighter, although there are times when he has shown great courage in order to protect his friends. His features include a video telephone inside his chest cavity, secret recording devices, a camera, and a storage pouch. His yellow face also glows in the dark. His personality is very playful and imaginative- he sometimes pretends to be a secret agent for Abby, disguising himself with her jewelry and hair accessories. Though creative, Dondon is needy of Abby and can be quite bashful with strangers. Voiced by Tara Strong. Cerebrix: Cerebrix is Chip's robot. Like his master, Cerebrix is more of a thought focused character rather than feeling. Bipedal, with no arms, he is equipped with advanced memory, sensory, computing and processing systems stored in his ""large head"". He can also fly by means of a retractable propeller stored in an upper compartment of his head. His main functions include a huge sensory array and he is also equipped with two antennae through which he can tap into almost any communication wavelength and cause disturbances, creating confusion in his foes. Also his advanced probability computing system is capable of determining the outcomes of events before they occur. His personality and speech are much more machine-like but what he has to say is usually very important. Voiced by Jimmy Zoppi. Kan-it: Kan-It is an Attractix model, and the only bot not to be own by a Bottie. Kan-It has a passion for singing, and as such was nicknamed Kan-It because Dr. K, his original master, did not like it. Kan-It speaks in a stereotypical British accent, saying cockney phrases like ""Governor"" and ""Blimey"". Kan-It control's his magnetic power by saying Magnet On(Positive Charge), Magnet Off!(Neutral Charge), Reverse Polarity(Negative Charge). Kan-It currently resides at the Botties Pit, voiced by Terri Irwin's husband Steve Irwin. Villainous Robots. Kilobot: First appearing on the second season, Kilobot is vampiric and far smarter than any of his cohorts, and Dr. K's finest creation. Developed to absorb data from other robots, Kilobot's name comes from the fact that he has the potential to copy the powers of up to 1000 other robots. As such, his power is potentially unlimited. Kilobot originally appeared in a bat-like form, but later upgraded to a bulkier body designed after Cubix's cubes. Kilobot is Cubix's new arch-enemy. At the finale, he took control of Dr. K's robots and planned an ultimate takeover. However, he was permanently deactivated by his own Zombot. Klank: Klank was one of Dr. K's first robots from when he was a child. Klank originally had no EPU, so when the botties found Klank in a disposal room at RobixCorp, they install one to help him adjust to the modern world. Klank's new emotions drive him to seek out Dr. K at an old abandoned house. Unlike Dr. K's other robots, Klank only appears in one episode. Kolossal: A Frankenstein's monster-esque robot, Kolossal is the brute of Dr. K's forces. Not too intelligent and continuously relies on his master for orders but almost equal to Cubix in fighting ability, Kolossal serves as Cubix's nemesis in the early part of the show. Kolossal's equipped with various weapons but most importantly a detachable floating platform on his left shoulder where Dr. K. takes seat. Kolossal is big and strong, although bulky he is capable of limited flight and agile high jumps, his left hand is a sort of claw that can be launched to grab things from afar. Most of the time he uses only brute force to win. Without his master's continuous coordination however he can only complete basic tasks. Kontraption: Dr. K's largest automaton, Kontraption serves as his blimp headquarters after his original base is destroyed. However, Kontraption can also turn into a large robot with great destructive capability. Krab: Squat and crustacean-like, Krab has powerful claws and shoulders that contain a variety of weapons. Katastrophe: A robot capable of splitting into two halves. Katastrophe's top half can fly, while the bottom rolls around on a wheel. Kannon: An artillery robot developed by Dr. K, his body is an assembly of cannons. Klawber: Menace of the skies, Klawber is a super-fast plane that flies through the air. Voiced by Frank Welker. Kulminator: Dr. K's second most powerful robot (behind Kilobot). It was once Dr. K's HQ as a giant advertisement tower in an abandoned area of Bubble Town. After Dr. K had gathered enough Solex, he used it to create a humongous EPU which transformed his HQ into a giant four-legged robot. Dr. K piloted it on a course for Bubble Town with intentions to destroy it. The Botties (piloting Krab, Katastrophe, Klawber, and Kannon) attempted to stop it, but it was too big. The Alien then used the Kulminator's ultimate weapon, the Solex Blaster, to destroy Cubix, but he absorbed the energy and then fired a Solex blast of his own, knocking out the Kulminator's shields. Dr. K wanted to retreat, but the Alien was determined to continue, firing the Solex Blaster at everything while Dr. K abandoned ship. Cubix then flung himself into Kulminator, striking its EPU, destroying it and the Alien. It appeared in 'Cubix the Movie: The Search For Solex' and in season 1 Episode 13 'The Unbeatable Robot'. Zombots: Dr. K's army of duplicating machines. When defeated, their parts can regenerate into new Zombots. In addition, they can evolve into larger, stronger versions of themselves. List of episodes.

wikipedia-3925336," Charity fraud  Charity fraud is the act of using deception to get money from people who believe they are making donations to charities. Often a person or a group of people will make material representations that they are a charity or part of a charity and ask prospective donors for contributions to the non-existent charity. Charity fraud not only includes fictitious charities but also deceitful business acts. Deceitful business acts include businesses accepting donations and not using the money for its intended purposes. Prevention in the United States of America. There are controls and laws governing charities and businesses that accept donations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) has regulations that can be found on their websites. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provides online information about avoiding charity fraud, such as fraudulent schemes that emerge in the wake of natural disasters, claiming to be providing disaster relief. The Internet Crime Complaint Center maintains a list of guidelines to avoid charity fraud when making a donation.  It is advised that people should follow certain guidelines when they donate and that they should consult a list such as the one on the BBB’s website. This list includes the participants in the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's National Charity Seal Program. Participants have met standards for charity accountability and may, for a fee, display the seal logo on their websites as well as any other printed documents. "
wikipedia-3925343," UBI World TV  UBI World TV was an Australian digital satellite pay television service that broadcast predominantly ethnic-minority (and mainly non-English-language) channels. It was launched in late 2004 and closed on Friday 8 June 2012. It offered over 80 channels in its lineup with programming from over 20 countries and in more than 12 languages.  The company also provided entertainment and information services to non-English speakers throughout Australia and New Zealand. It specialised in providing Australian nationals with many different ethnic backgrounds, race, culture, ancestry and/or descent with TV channels from their native or respective homeland, showing news, current affairs, sports, drama series, movies and general entertainment in their own language as a multi-cultural service provider. UBI World TV broadcast TV and radio channels to Australia and New Zealand using the Optus D2 and Intelsat 8 (IS8) satellites. On Wednesday 13 June at approximately 7.00 PM Sydney time, UBI World TV changed its website to inform its customers that it has ceased to trade. The website announcement read as follows: ""On 17 May 2012, BRI Ferrier was appointed Voluntary Administrator of United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd (UBI)."" ""On 1 June 2012, Receivers and Managers from Grant Thornton were appointed to United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd."" ""With effect from 5:00pm on Friday 8 June 2012, United Broadcasting International Pty Ltd ceased to trade."" ""The Receivers and managers are engaged in efforts to dispose of UBI assets that may result in the provision of future channel and broadcast services to subscribers."" ""Subscribers who have paid subscriptions in advance and are no longer receiving transmissions together with unsecured creditors should contact the Voluntary Administrator and lodge a proof of debt."" ""UBI World TV has been proud to have served the multicultural communities of Australia and New Zealand for the past 7 years and would like to thank each and every loyal subscriber for their support."" ""Thank you and goodbye. Salamat at paalam. Gracias y adios. Hoscakalin. Shukran we ma3 elsalama. Ви благодарам и збогум. Hvala i prijatno. Obrigado e adeus. Σας ευχαριστώ και αντίο."" Mass piracy of the service. In late 2008, UBI introduced the new Irdeto Epsilon card part of its encryption process. This new card was considered secure at the time, and most importantly could not be used in sharing servers due to its ""Surf Lock"" countermeasure. By mid-2009, pirates had found a way to bypass this countermeasure and began offering some of the UBI channels on their pirate sharing servers for a cheap yearly fee. Because those sharing servers required the customer to have an internet connection and a satellite dish simultaneously, the pirate service was later reduced to a few channels as there was little interest, owing to UBI's audience being mostly elderly and without access to the internet at home. In December 2010, a team of worldwide hackers introduced the Dragon Card. The card was available in three flavours, Yellow (for ME and AFRICA), Blue (Europe) and the RED (Australia). The Red Dragon Card or RDC was used to pirate Austar, Mysat, TVB, UBI and all the GLOBECAST clients. However as there was a shortage for the Dragon Cards in Australia, hackers in Australia decided to hack the RDC. They converted it to software that runs in the famous Dreambox Satellite Receiver (dm500). The result was the EMUBOX 500 aka the OFFLINE BOX. This very cheap box (circa A$40), now equipped with the RDC codes, was able to decode most Australian services without an internet connection or a SmartCard: just ""plug and watch"". EMUBOX 500 hit the piracy market in late 2011, and was sold in satellite shops for around A$75. By mid-2012 an estimated 50,000 boxes had been sold, mainly in Sydney and Melbourne, leaving satellite shops with no stock. At the current stage, sales have dropped for the operators and for the pirate servers. One pirate server operator asked a hacker to extract the codes used in emubox and sucssesfully sent the codes to Irdeto, resulting in the death of all codes. Strangely, UBI codes remained active until the collapse of the company. One hacker explained that Irdeto, in order to kill a code, need to roll the keys otherwise known as Group Keys. This normally occurs every fortnight, and it is not a free service. Channel history. UBI World TV offered programming that catered to several of the following ethnicities:  "
wikipedia-3925368," Value menu  A value menu (not to be confused with a value meal) is a group of menu items at a fast food restaurant that are designed to be the least expensive items available. In the US, the items are usually priced between $0.99 and $1.49. The portion size, and/or number of items included with the food, are typically related to the price. United States. Arby's. Arby's announced the launch of their value menu on April 9, 2010. Items on the value menu vary based on location, but typically include small or value size roast beef sandwiches, curly fries, milkshakes, chicken sandwiches, ham and cheddar sandwiches, and turnovers. Burger King. Burger King added a value menu in 1998 with items priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu, adding and removing products at 99¢, and later increasing some prices to $1.39. Many of these items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option. McDonald's. After numerous attempts beginning in 1991, experimenting with a variety of menus and pricing strategies, McDonald's launched its first national value menu, the ""Dollar Menu"", in late 2002. Taco Bell. In 1988, Taco Bell lowered the prices of all new items and launched the first three-tiered pricing strategy and free drink refills. In 2010, Taco Bell introduced the $2 Meal Deals menu, featuring a menu item (i.e., a chicken burrito, a beefy 5-layer burrito, a double decker taco, or a Gordita supreme), a bag of Doritos, and a medium drink. Wendy's. Wendy's is generally credited with being the first fast food chain to offer a value menu in October 1989, with every item priced at $0.99. "
wikipedia-3925415," Embarq  Embarq Corporation (stylized as EMBARQ) was the largest independent local exchange carrier in the United States (below the Baby Bells), serving customers in 18 states and providing local, long-distance, high-speed data and wireless services to residential and business customers. It had been formerly the local telephone division (LTD) of Sprint Nextel until 2006, when it was spun off as an independent company. Embarq produced more than $6 billion in revenues annually, and had approximately 18,000 employees. In 2009, it was purchased by CenturyTel, which rebranded as CenturyLink after the merger. History. Brown Telephone Company. The Sprint Corporation was founded in 1899 by Cleyson Leroy Brown under the name of the ""Brown Telephone Company"" in the small town of Abilene, Kansas. The company was a landline telephone company that operated as a competitor to the Bell System. United Telecom. In 1938, after emerging from bankruptcy, Brown changed its name to United Utilities. The company grew steadily through acquisitions and changed its name to United Telecommunications in 1972, at which time it provided local telephone service in many areas of the Midwest and South. United Telecom also operated many other types of businesses. In 1980 United Telecom launched a national X.25 data service, Uninet. To enter the long-distance voice market, United Telecom acquired ISACOMM in 1981 and US Telephone in 1984. Sprint. Southern Pacific Communications Company (SPCC), a unit of the Southern Pacific Railroad, began providing long-distance telephone service shortly after the Execunet II decision late in 1978. The Railroad had an extensive microwave communications system along its rights of way used for internal communications. In 1972 they began selling surplus time on that system to corporations for use as their own Private Line Network, thereby circumventing AT&T's then-monopoly on public telephony, later expanding to fiber optic cables laid along those same rights of way subsequent to the Execunet II decision late in 1978. Prior attempts at offering long distance service were not approved by the Federal Communications Commission, though the company's fax service (SpeedFAX) had been permitted. SPC was headquartered in Burlingame, California, where Sprint still maintains a technology lab on Adrian Court. As mentioned above, SPCC was only permitted to provide Private Line service and not switched services. When MCI Communications released EXECUNET, SPCC went to court with the FCC to get the right to offer switched services. The reason for the contest was to name the new switched service.  The SPRINT service was first marketed to six metropolitan areas, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Diego and Anaheim. The switches were located in Los Angeles and New York. A customer, required to have a Private Line connection to one of these switches in order to use the service, paid an access fee per Private Line. The customer was then billed at 2.6 cents per tenth of a minute increment. Southern Pacific Communications became part of GTE in 1982 under the name GTE Sprint. GTE had previously acquired a national X.25 provider, Telenet, in 1979. In 1986, GTE Sprint was merged with GTE Telenet, US Telecom, Uninet, and ISACOMM to form US Sprint. This was a partnership owned by GTE and United Telecom. In 1989 United Telecom purchased controlling interest in US Sprint. In 1991 United Telecom completed its acquisition of US Sprint. That same year United Telecom changed its name to Sprint due in large part to the increased brand recognition of Sprint, as a result of the successful Candice Bergen ""Dime Lady"" advertisement campaign. In 1983 United Telecom's Telespectrum began offering cellular telephone services in United's territories. In 1988 Telespectrum was sold to Centel for $763 million to fund United's purchase of an additional 30% of U.S. Sprint. This purchase gave United operational control of US Sprint. In 1993 Sprint merged with Centel, which allowed Sprint to provide local service in a total of 18 states and put them back in the wireless business. In late 1994 and early 1995, Sprint via Sprint Spectrum (a joint venture between Sprint and several cable companies) acquired near nationwide PCS spectrum. Later in 1995 the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint PCS brand. On October 5, 1999, Sprint and MCI WorldCom announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies. The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time. However, the deal did not go through because of pressure from the United States Department of Justice and the European Union on concerns of it creating a monopoly. In 2003 Sprint began recombining their local telecom, long-distance, wireline, and wireless business units into a new company, marketing the combined company as ""One Sprint"". In April 2004, the separately traded wireless tracking stock, ""PCS"", was absorbed into the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ""FON"" ticker symbol, Sprint's former ticker symbol. (FON stood for ""Fiber Optic Network"", which was Sprint's bragging right, but was also a homophone of the word ""phone""). This was challenged in many lawsuits by Sprint PCS shareholders claiming the stock was devalued through the ratio of 1 share of PCS stock for 1/2 share of FON stock. Sprint agreed to settle with the shareholders for $57.5 million. Merger with Nextel and Embarq spinoff. In 2005, Sprint acquired NEXTEL Communications, renaming itself Sprint Nextel. The local operations were spun off in 2006 to become Embarq. Acquisition by CenturyTel. On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $11.6 billion, including the assumption of $5.8 billion in Embarq's debt. CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post became CEO of the combined company. On June 2, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq announced that the combined entity would be called CenturyLink. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009. Former coverage area. Embarq's coverage territory included that of the former incumbent local exchange carrier companies of Carolina Telephone & Telegraph, United Telephone Company, and Centel. Embarq provided its local service in 19 states. Products. Embarq focused on sales of landline telephone service, high-speed internet, and DISH Network satellite TV. Embarq offered bundled services to their customers, with the convenience of one monthly bill and offered discounts for adding additional services.  Embarq telephone service was a traditional landline Plain-old telephone system (POTS). Common offerings included features such as Caller ID, Call waiting, 3-way calling, Call forwarding, Voice mail, and Anonymous call rejection. Embarq offered many long distance plans, including unlimited domestic direct-dialed calling. Depending on market and geographical region, Embarq offered several high-speed internet technologies. Embarq covered the majority of their territory with ADSL at speeds of 768 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s, 3.0 Mbit/s, or 5.0 Mbit/s as line conditions allowed. In September 2007 Embarq began offering 10.0 Mbit/s to customers in Las Vegas. Beginning in January 2008, Embarq released the 10 Mbit/s tier across their entire footprint. Embarq offered fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) in additional markets, such as parts of Las Vegas, Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. Embarq had and established partnership with EchoStar-owned DISH Network and offered a comprehensive lineup of DISH Network services to its customers. Discounts were available when eligible DISH Network programming was bundled with other qualifying Embarq products. In addition to the DISH Network partnership, Embarq also planned to test a TV service (tentatively called Embarq TV) in the near future. Details were scarce, but the service was rumored to have been an IPTV fiber-to-the-node service similar to AT&T's U-verse. Testing was completed and Embarq/CenturyLink rolled out IPTV to its customer base in Jefferson City, MO in October 2009. CenturyTel is providing its IPTV feed to the Jefferson City switching office from its service in Columbia, MO. CenturyLink now offers its Prism TV service in select markets, which may be based off of Embarq TV.  Embarq provided wireless phone service only for business accounts; they closed residential wireless business. Embarq provided business wireless phone service throughout much of its territory. Embarq operated as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) for Sprint PCS. Embarq utilized the CDMA band, and their handsets connect primarily to Sprint PCS towers. However, Embarq handsets were also capable of roaming onto CDMA networks from other carriers. Embarq DSL customers were offered free Earthlink services until the formation of Myembarq.com. In 2007, Embarq customers were required to switch to Myembarq and Embarqmail. Criticisms. Embarq previously worked with NebuAd, a behavioral targeting advertising company to track customers' internet browsing habits. The goal was to deliver relevant ads based on browsing history. This has raised several legal and privacy concerns, along with the other internet providers using NebuAd and related services such as Charter Communications and WOW!. Embarq's use of NebuAd prompted a letter from Congressman Edward Markey. Embarq responded to Congressman Markey's letter. Embarq later claimed that its participation with NebuAD was a trial, and that they were not currently using NebuAd for behavioral targeted advertising. "
wikipedia-3925423," First Data  First Data Corporation is a global payment processing company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. First Data is a provider of electronic commerce and payment solutions. The company's portfolio includes merchant transaction processing services; credit, debit, private-label, gift, payroll and other prepaid card offerings; fraud protection and authentication solutions, credit reporting agency services (through First Data Merchant Services Corporation); electronic check acceptance services through TeleCheck; as well as Internet commerce and mobile payment solutions. The company's STAR Network offers PIN-secured debit acceptance at ATM and retail locations. History. In 1969, the Mid-America Bankcard Association (MABA) was formed in Omaha, Nebraska, as a non-profit bankcard processing cooperative. Two years later, First Data Resources (FDR) incorporated in June to become a for-profit organization providing processing services to MABA. FDR had 110 employees and $222 million in annual revenues. First Data is an agglomeration of various cooperative associations which were initially established to provide credit card data processing services for member banks. These include Eastern States Bankcard Association; Atlantic States Bankcard Association; Southwestern States Bankcard Association; Mountain States Bankcard Association, and Western States Bankcard Association. In 1980, American Express Information Services Corporation (ISC) bought 80% of FDR. The remaining 20% was purchased in 5% increments each subsequent year until June 1983. First Data Corporation spun off from American Express and went public in 1992. In 1995, the company merged with First Financial Management Corp. (FFMC) and was then organized into three major business units serving card issuers, merchants and consumers. Western Union became part of First Data as a result of the merger with FFMC.  By 1998, First Data was providing transaction processing services not only in the U.S., but also in markets around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Canada. The company also began to see significant growth in its network of Western Union agent locations. This set the stage for First Data to become a leading global provider of electronic commerce and payment solutions to businesses and consumers worldwide.  From 2001 through 2005, a period of expansion occurred as First Data acquired companies around the globe and in the U.S., including, in 2001, the acquisition of PaySys International and their globally successful VisionPLUS Payment Software System VisionPLUS followed by $6.6 billion merger with Concord EFS in 2004, which added the STAR Network and PIN-based debit acceptance at more than 1.9 million ATM and retail locations. Additional acquisitions and strategic relationships included GovOne, the creation of eONEGlobal as a venture capital fund, the acquisition of Paymap, Inc., a company servicing electronic payment products, and the acquisition of Taxware, which would be merged into a new entity, named Velosant to spearhead broad Supply Chain Management initiatives. First Data also established a consumer payments brand which would take Direct Debit offerings to the retail marketplace. First Data further expanded geographically in Europe, Asia and Latin America.  In 2005, First Data was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. On January 26, 2006, First Data announced its intention to spin off Western Union into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Western Union to First Data shareholders. The spin off occurred as planned on September 29, 2006.  On April 2, 2007 it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) had entered an agreement to acquire First Data in one of the largest leveraged buy-outs in history, and on October 1, 2007 KKR officially took over the First Data Corporation. Ric Duques retired, and Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI, Inc., the president of Hewlett-Packard Company, and also the chairman/CEO of the Compaq Computer Corporation was appointed CEO. As a privately owned company, First Data's stock was taken off the New York Stock Exchange on September 24, 2007. However, the company's LBO was financed with $24 billion in debt, and it remains heavily leveraged. The company continues to maintain investor relations pages on its web site and to publish quarterly financial results. Within two months after the KKR acquisition, the company laid off 1,700 employees across North America, Europe and Australia, about 6% of its workforce. First Data entered the Ireland market in a joint venture with Allied Irish Banks plc named AIB Merchant Services on January 18, 2008. First Data also acquired ICICI Bank's merchant services business in 2009 for 4 billion Indian rupees ($80 million USD). The processing platforms maintained by First Data are North(Cardnet), South(Nabanco), Nashville(Envoy), Omaha and BuyPass(Concord/Atlanta). Management. Key executives include: Headquarters. First Data's headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. First Data's headquarters were located in Greenwood Village, Colorado. In 2009 First Data announced that it was moving its headquarters from Greater Denver to 5565 Glenridge Connector, NE Atlanta, GA 30342 . Its original headquarters, where the company remained based until 1992, were in Omaha, Nebraska. "
wikipedia-3925445," International zone  An international zone is a type of extraterritoriality governed by international law, or similar treaty between two or more nations. They can be found within international airports and can contain duty free shopping. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other. Green Zone (Iraq). Iraq has its international zone around the Republican Palace in central Baghdad in a crook of the Tigris River. This area was and still is the heavily fortified headquarters for the coalition and Iraqi Reconstruction Ministries. The official name started as the ""Green Zone"" but was later changed to the ""International Zone"" in June 2004 with the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people. Vienna after World War II. French, British, American and Soviet troops divided Vienna into four zones, and a small international zone was governed in rotation by troops of those countries. International airports. International airports have international zones for individuals who have not cleared customs and immigration of the hosting country. United Nations Headquarters. The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City that exists on international territory. The territory is administered by the United Nations, but is still subjected to most local, state, and federal laws. The United Nations has three additional, subsidiary, regional headquarters or headquarter districts. These are located in Geneva (Switzerland), Vienna (Austria), and Nairobi (Kenya). These adjunct offices also enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges. Channel Tunnel. The United Kingdom and France established ""international zones"" or ""control zones"" at both ends of the Channel Tunnel, which crosses underneath the English Channel. British authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the French side, and French authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the UK side. Violations in the control zone are treated as if they occurred within the territory of the adjoining state within that zone, and extradition is not required to remove a violator to the operating state for prosecution. Officers of the adjoining state may carry firearms within the control zone. Tangier. The city of Tangier, Morocco, was an international zone from 1912 to 1956. Ottawa Civic Hospital, Canada. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands was born in Ottawa, Canada, as the family had been living in there since June 1940 after the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany. The maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital in which Princess Margriet was born was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government. Making the maternity ward outside of the Canadian domain caused it to be unaffiliated with any jurisdiction and technically international territory. This was done to ensure that the newborn Princess would derive her citizenship from her mother only, thus making her solely Dutch and still viable for the Dutch line of succession to the throne. Proposals for Jerusalem. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the city of Jerusalem was supposed to become an International Zone. This was never implemented, the city becoming the scene of fierce fighting in 1948 which culminated with its partition between Israel and Jordan. Nineteen years later in 1967 the Jordanian part was occupied and unilaterally annexed by Israel. However, the idea of an international zone in Jerusalem, embracing at least the highly sensitive Old City of Jerusalem, continue to be floated by various would-be mediators. "
wikipedia-3925533," Enumerative combinatorics  Enumerative combinatorics is an area of combinatorics that deals with the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed. Two examples of this type of problem are counting combinations and counting permutations. More generally, given an infinite collection of finite sets {""S""""i""} indexed by the natural numbers, enumerative combinatorics seeks to describe a ""counting function"" which counts the number of objects in ""S""""n"" for each ""n"". Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions. The simplest such functions are ""closed formulas"", which can be expressed as a composition of elementary functions such as factorials, powers, and so on. For instance, as shown below, the number of different possible orderings of a deck of ""n"" cards is ""f""(""n"") = ""n""!. Often, no closed form is initially available. In these cases, we frequently first derive a recurrence relation, then solve the recurrence to arrive at the desired closed form.  Finally, ""f""(""n"") may be expressed by a formal power series, called its ""generating function"", which is most commonly either the ordinary generating function or the exponential generating function Often, a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows.  In these cases, a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable. A function formula_3 is an asymptotic approximation to formula_4 if formula_5 as formula_6. In this case, we write formula_7  Once determined, the generating function yields the information given by the previous approaches. In addition, the various natural operations on generating functions such as addition, multiplication, differentiation, etc., have a combinatorial significance; this allows one to extend results from one combinatorial problem in order to solve others. Generating functions. Generating functions are used to describe families of combinatorial objects. Let formula_8 denote the family of objects and let ""F""(""x"") be its generating function. Then: Where formula_10 denotes the number of combinatorial objects of size ""n"". The number of combinatorial objects of size ""n"" is therefore given by the coefficient of formula_11. Some common operation on families of combinatorial objects and its effect on the generating function will now be developed. The exponential generating function is also sometimes used. In this case it would have the form: Union. Given two combinatorial families, formula_8 and formula_14 with generating functions ""F""(""x"") and ""G""(""x"") respectively, the union of the two families (formula_15) has generating function ""F""(""x"") + ""G""(""x""). Pairs. For two combinatorial families as above the Cartesian product (pair) of the two families (formula_16) has generating function ""F""(""x"")""G""(""x""). Sequences. A sequence generalizes the idea of the pair as defined above. Sequences are arbitrary Cartesian products of a combinatorial object with itself. Formally: To put the above in words: An empty sequence or a sequence of one element or a sequence of two elements or a sequence of three elements, etc. The generating function would be: Combinatorial structures. The above operations can now be used to enumerate common combinatorial objects including trees (binary and plane), Dyck paths and cycles. A combinatorial structure is composed of atoms. For example, with trees the atoms would be the nodes. The atoms which compose the object can either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled atoms are indistinguishable from each other, while labelled atoms are distinct. Therefore, for a combinatorial object consisting of labeled atoms a new object can be formed by simply swapping two or more atoms. Binary and plane trees. Binary and plane trees are examples of an unlabeled combinatorial structure. Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let formula_19 denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows: In this case formula_21 represents the family of objects consisting of one node. This has generating function ""x"". Let ""P""(""x"") denote the generating function formula_19 Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function: After solving for ""P""(""x""): An explicit formula for the number of plane trees of size ""n"" can now be determined by extracting the coefficient of ""x""""n"". Note: The notation [""x""""n""] ""f""(""x"") refers to the coefficient of ""x""""n"" in ""f""(""x""). The series expansion of the square root is based on Newton's generalization of the Binomial theorem. To get from the fourth to fifth line manipulations using the generalized binomial coefficient is needed.  The expression on the last line is equal to the (""n"" -1)th Catalan number. Therefore ""p""""n"" = ""c""""n""-1. "
wikipedia-3925565," Extraocular implant  An extraocular implant (also known as ""eyeball jewelry"") is a cosmetic implant involving a tiny piece of decorative jewelry which is implanted within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye. History and culture. Eyeball jewelry was developed first in the Netherlands as a radical new form of body modification in 2002. It was first designed at the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery and is marketed there under the name JewelEye. The procedure is completely legal in the Netherlands, as long as it is performed by a licensed ophthalmologist under sterile conditions. The current cost is approximately €750 .  Its legality outside of the Netherlands is currently untested. However, several jurisdictions in the US have already supported bills to ban the procedure even though it hasn’t become available in the US yet. On March 6, 2005, an Illinois state committee approved a bill banning the procedure. Infraction could result in a penalty of up to three years in prison. Procedure. Unlike subdermal implants and other new body modification procedures, the extraocular implant is currently only being performed in a medical clinic environment. The procedure is relatively quick, but it does require that both eyes be immobilized with anesthetic drops, and that the layers of the eyeball where the implant is situated must be separated by the injection of liquid. As very few people have undergone this procedure, and it is relatively new, the long term health effects are currently unknown. However, the Website of the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery states that the implant does not interfere with the ocular functions, i.e. the visual performance and mobility. Additionally, patient satisfaction remains high and no side effects of the treatment have been noticed with a follow-up of more than one year. Jewelry. Currently, the only supplier of jewelry for this implant is Hippocratech b.v., a company in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The implant is manufactured from a platinum alloy and is available in several basic shapes, including the Euro sign, heart, music note, clover or star shapes, with other shapes custom made by the company upon request. The size of the jewellery is about 1/8"" (3 mm) across. "
wikipedia-3925621," Volksempfänger  The Volksempfänger (German for ""people's receiver"") was a range of radio receivers developed by engineer Otto Griessing at the request of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The purpose of the ""Volksempfänger""-program was to make radio reception technology affordable to the general public. Joseph Goebbels realized the great propaganda potential of this relatively new medium and thus considered widespread availability of receivers highly important. History. The original Volksempfänger VE301 model was presented on August 18, 1933 at the 10. Große Deutsche Funkausstellung in Berlin. The VE301 was available at a readily affordable price of 76 German Reichsmark (equivalent to two weeks' average salary), and a cheaper 35 Reichsmark model, the DKE38 (sometimes called ""Goebbels-Schnauze"" – ""Goebbels' snout"" – by the general public) fitted with a multisection tube, was also later produced, along with a series of other models under the Volksempfänger, Gemeinschaftsempfänger, KdF (Kraft durch Freude), DKE (Deutscher Kleinempfänger) and other brands. Listening to foreign stations became a criminal offence in Nazi Germany when the war began, while in some occupied territories, such as Poland, all radio listening by non-German citizens was outlawed (later in the war this prohibition was extended to other occupied countries coupled with mass seizures of radio sets). Penalties ranged from confiscation of radios and imprisonment to, particularly later in the war, the death penalty. Nevertheless, such clandestine listening was widespread in many Nazi-occupied countries and (particularly later in the war) in Germany itself. The Germans also attempted radio jamming of some enemy stations with limited success. Effects. Much has been said about the efficiency of the ""Volksempfänger"" as a propaganda tool. Most famously, Hitler's architect and Minister for Armaments and War Production, Albert Speer, said in his final speech at the Nuremberg trials: However, despite Speer's claim, both Mussolini's Italy and Stalin's Russia had used radio as a tool to influence the masses long before Hitler's rise to power. Utility receiver. The British equivalent of the Volksempfänger was the Utility Radio which was produced to a standard government approved design by a consortium of manufacturers using standard components to make repair easier. It was designed without a longwave band, making reception of foreign stations even more difficult than with the Volksempfänger. "
wikipedia-3925654," NatWest Series  The NatWest Series is the name used for One Day International cricket tournaments held in England since 2000. The tournaments are sponsored by the National Westminster Bank. 2000 to 2005: triangular series. The original format of the NatWest Series was a three-team triangular tournament, involving England and two visiting international sides. Each of the three teams would play the other two three times each, after which the two top teams would face each other in a final at Lord's in London. The ten matches would be played at the seven international grounds (Lord's, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford, The Oval, Trent Bridge and the Riverside Ground), a well as other county cricket grounds such as the St Lawrence Ground (Canterbury), Sophia Gardens (Cardiff), the Rose Bowl (Southampton) and at Bristol. The first NatWest Series was held in 2000 a year after England hosted the World Cup. The West Indies and Zimbabwe were the two visiting teams, with England and Zimbabwe contesting the first final. England won by 6 wickets, with Darren Gough taking 3–20 and Alec Stewart scoring 97. It used to be a common occurrence at the end of cricket Test matches for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK this tradition ended in 2001 Natwest Series after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a one-day match between England and Pakistan. Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine, and post-match presentations are held on the field. During the presentation ceremony at the 2001 NatWest Series final on the balcony at Lord's, Michael Bevan was hit in the face with a beer can thrown from the crowd. Other notable matches in the series included the 2002 final, where England faced India: England posted a total of 325–5 with Nasser Hussain scoring 115, his only one day century, and Marcus Trescothick also scoring 109, but were beaten by India who made 326–8 thanks to Mohammad Kaif scoring 87 and Yuvraj Singh 69. In 2005, Bangladesh secured an unexpected victory over Australia in Cardiff, with Mohammad Ashraful scoring a century. Also, that year's final between Australia and England was a tie, with both sides scoring 196 and sharing the trophy. By the time of the last triangular tournament in 2005, every test-playing nation had participated in at least one NatWest Series. NatWest Challenge. For three seasons, from 2003 to 2005, three extra One Day Internationals were arranged for the England team in addition to the NatWest Series. In 2003, Pakistan came to England for the three match series. In 2004, India played the NatWest Challenge as a prelude to the ICC Champions Trophy held in England that year. The following year, Australia played these matches between the NatWest Series and The Ashes. The ICC began their trial of the ""Supersub"", 12th man who could bat or bowl and ""Powerplay"", flexible fielding restrictions in the 2005 matches. The Supersub idea was jettisoned after a year whilst the Powerplay experiment was retained. 2006 to date. The triangular format was abandoned in 2006, when England reverted to playing separate series against each visiting team (as they had in the Texaco Trophy from 1984 until 1998), but the name NatWest Series was retained. This was attributed to the poor crowds at matches not involving the home team. The NatWest Series includes one or two matches in the Twenty20 cricket format against the touring team. The home team now plays 10 One Day Internationals a season. In 2006, England played five matches against each of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing 5–0 to Sri Lanka and drawing 2–2 with Pakistan. In 2007, the visiting teams were the West Indies and India: England lost the three-match series against the West Indies 2–1, and defeated India 4–3 in the seven-match series. 2008 Series. In June 2008, England lost the five-match series against New Zealand 3–1 with one match rained off. During a close match 4 at The Oval that NZ won, Grant Elliott was controversially ran out after a mid-pitch collision with Ryan Sidebottom. In August/September 2008, England beat South Africa 4–0 in the five match series with the final match rained off. Led by new captain Kevin Pietersen, a revitalised England beat an ""end of tour"" South Africa. In match 2 in Nottingham, SA were bowled out for 83 and England won the day/night match before the floodlights were required. In the Twenty20 matches, England beat New Zealand in the only match in Manchester in June however the match against South Africa at Chester-le-Street was abandoned without a ball being bowled. 2009 Series. In May 2009, England led by Andrew Strauss beat the West Indies 2–0 with one match rained off. England won both matches, by 58 runs at Birmingham and by 6 wickets, Bristol, respectively. There were no Twenty20 internationals scheduled due to the ICC World Twenty20 event in June. In August/September England were scheduled to play two Twenty20 matches at Manchester versus Australia. The first match was abandoned during the England innings and the second match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. A seven match series was contested in September 2009 versus Australia after the home team's Ashes series win. The Australians won the first six, at The Oval, two at Lords, Southampton and two at Nottingham, and England won the final match at the Chester-le-Street. The top run scorer in the series was Andrew Strauss, 267 runs for England, who also scored most in the Ashes Test match series. Top wicket taker was Brett Lee, 12 wickets for Australia, who did not appear in the summer's Test series. 2010 Series. During the 2010 summer there were three NatWest Series. In June 2010, England played a five match tour series versus Australia, who were in the country to play a Test series Pakistan. England beat the Australians 3–2 winning the first three matches with Eoin Morgan scoring the most runs, 238 runs and Stuart Broad taking 12 wickets on either side. In July, England beat Bangladesh 2–1 in a three match series. The series was notable as Bangladesh beat England for the very first time in one-day cricket. In September, England played Pakistan in two Twenty20 matches (not part of the NatWest Series) and a five match one-day match series. This series was played with the backdrop of spot fixing allegations made against Pakistani players during the Test match series against England. England won the two Twenty20 matches at Cardiff. England then went on to win the one-day series 3–2. England lost the 3rd match at The Oval by 23 runs. The ICC launched an investigation into the match after receiving information that there were scoring irregularities during the England innings. Ijaz Butt the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman suggested that as ""a conspiracy"" to defraud Pakistan cricket. Butt went on to accuse England players of bad practice, allegations he later withdrew. Andrew Strauss scored the most runs, 317 runs and Umar Gul took most wickets, 12, during the series. 2011 Series. In June and July 2011, England won the five match series 3–2 versus Sri Lanka. England won the close deciding 5th match at Old Trafford by 16 runs. The 2nd match at The Oval was notable as Sri Lankan batsman Sanath Jayasuriya played his 445th and final one-day international. England's captain Alastair Cook scored the most runs in the series (298). Sri Lankan Spinner Suraj Randiv and England fast bowler James Anderson were joint highest wicket takers, (9). Sri Lanka won the Nat West Twenty20 International by 9 wickets at Bristol. In September, England won a five match series versus India 3–0 with one tied match and one no result. The 4th match at Lords ended in a tie under the Duckworth-Lewis method. The 5th match at Cardiff, was Rahul Dravid's 344th and final one-day international. He also played his first and last Twenty20 International at Old Trafford. England won the that match, at the end of August, by 6 wickets. In the one day series, Indian captain MS Dhoni scored the most runs, (236) and English spinner Graeme Swann took the most wickets (8). India went through the whole tour of England without a win in an international match, after also losing the Test series 4–0. England played two more Twenty20 Internationals at The Oval versus the West Indies to close the season. The series ended 1–1. NatWest Series results since 2006. '* One match no result "
wikipedia-3925840," Richardson High School  Richardson High School (RHS) is a high school in Richardson, Texas, United States with a 2011 enrollment of approximately 2500 and a student/teacher ratio of 14.5. Background. Richardson High School is the flagship high school of the Richardson Independent School District (RISD). The school has magnet programs in fine arts, culinary arts, theatre, communications, robotics, law, health science and science, and award-winning mock trial and debate teams. In the 2012 ""U.S. News & World Report"" rankings of the Best Schools in America, Richardson High School ranked number 711 out of 21,766 public high schools, putting it in the top 3.5% of all public high schools in the United States. RHS was also rated the 65th best in the state of Texas. In August 2006, Richardson High School was named one of three ""best practices"" high schools in the state of Texas. The award granted by the National Council of Educational Accountability and the Just 4 Kids Foundation is based upon staff development, staff retention, standardized test scores and support programs for students.  In May 2007, the RISD was awarded the ""Excellence in Education Award for Large School District in Texas"" by the HEB Foundation. Richardson High School and Richardson West Junior High played instrumental roles in the selection process and hosted the site visit committee in March 2007. In addition to the award, the RISD received a check for $100,000. The school, which opened shortly after the first public school in the city was burned down by Ross Inman in 1890, began in a two-room building on Old Pike Road, a street that is now part of Greenville Avenue. A rural school with fewer than 100 students up to 1950, the school opened its present facility in 1961. During the period of the late 1950s, RHS shared facilities with Westwood Junior High School on Abrams Road. Bill Passmore was principal during this transition into the new facility on Belt Line Road. Richardson's sports mascot is the Eagles and the team shares Eagle-Mustang Stadium (capacity 11,000) with J. J. Pearce High School.  The school's student news magazine is the ""Talon"". As of the 2010–2011 school year, the administration at RHS is led by Charles Pickitt, principal; Ramiro Lucio, senior principal; Michael Westfall, assistant principal; Josh Eason, assistant principal; Elise Curry, assistant principal; Sharonda Tims, assistant principal; and Talandra Griffen, assistant principal. Jeremy Delle suicide. On January 8, 1991, Jeremy Delle, a 15-year-old sophomore who had recently transferred to the school, killed himself with a .357 Magnum revolver in front of his second-period English class. He was described by schoolmates as ""acting sad"". After coming into class late that morning, he was told to get an attendance slip from the school office. He left and returned with a revolver. He walked to the front of the class and announced, ""Miss, I got what I really went for."" Delle then put the gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger. The incident inspired the Pearl Jam song ""Jeremy"". The band's lead singer, Eddie Vedder, read a newspaper account of the incident and was moved to write the song almost immediately. KRET-TV. In 1960 the Richardson Independent School District established KRET, the first TV station in the nation to be owned by a school district. The studio was located at Richardson High from 1963–1970. The studio was previously located at Richardson Junior High School (1960–1963). The station was converted on August 31, 1970, into a closed-circuit network named ""TAGER"". Brent Archie incident.

wikipedia-3925944," Education in New York City  Education in New York City is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions. The city's public school system, the New York City Department of Education, is the largest in the world, and New York is home to some of the most important libraries, universities, and research centers in the world. The city is particularly known as a global center for research in medicine and the life sciences. In 2006, New York had the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the United States, 40,000 licensed physicians, and 127 Nobel laureates with roots in local institutions. The city receives the second-highest amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health among all U.S. cities. It also struggles with disparity in its public school system, with some of the best ""and"" worst performing public schools in the United States. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg the city has embarked on a major school reform effort. The New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the country, serves Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, and Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn. The New York Public Library has several research libraries, including the Main Branch and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Higher education. There are about 594,000 university students in New York City attending around 110 universities and colleges. New York State is the nation’s largest importer of college students, according to statistics which show that among freshmen who leave their home states to attend college, more come to New York than any other state, including California. Enrollment in New York State is led by New York City, which is home to more university students than any other city in the United States. The higher education sector is also a vital contributor to NYC's economy, employing 110,000 people in 2007 and accounting for nearly 2.5 percent of overall employment in NYC. Public higher education is provided by the many campuses of the City University of New York (CUNY), which has over 450,000 students, second in number only to the separate State University of New York (SUNY) and California State University. CUNY is built around the City College of New York, whose own history dates back to the formation of the Free Academy in 1847. Much of CUNY's student body, which represent 145 countries, consists of new immigrants to New York City. CUNY has campuses in all of the five boroughs, with 11 four-year colleges, 6 two-year colleges, a law school, a graduate school, a medical school, an honors college, and a journalism school. A third of college graduates in New York City are CUNY graduates, with the institution enrolling about half of all college students in New York City. The City University's alumni include Jonas Salk, Colin Powell, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. New York also has many nationally-important independent universities and colleges, such as (in alphabetical order) Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, Long Island University, Manhattan College, New York University, Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, Pace University, Pratt Institute, St. John's University, The New School, and Yeshiva University. The city has dozens of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions, such as St. Francis College, The Juilliard School and The School of Visual Arts. Columbia University, an Ivy League university in northwestern Manhattan founded in 1754, is the fifth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Barnard College is an independent women's college, one of the original Seven Sisters, affiliated with Columbia. Through a reciprocal agreement, Barnard and Columbia students share classes, housing, and extracurricular activities, and Barnard graduates receive the degree of the University. New York University (NYU) is a private, nonsectarian research university based in New York City. NYU's main campus is situated in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan. Founded in 1831, NYU is one of the largest private, nonprofit institutions of higher education in the United States. The New School, located mostly in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, is a private multidisciplinary university housing eight specialized colleges, including the internationally recognized art school, Parsons The New School for Design. Founded in 1919 as The New School for Social Research, the university established itself as a modern free school where adult students could ""seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working."" Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, was founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper to provide tuition-free education in engineering, architecture and the fine arts. For 150 years, the College has admitted students based on merit alone and provided each with a full-tuition scholarship. Two of the United States' leading Roman Catholic universities are in New York City. The Jesuit-associated Fordham University, with campuses in Manhattan and the Bronx, was the first Catholic university in the Northeast, founded in 1841. St. John's University was founded by the Vincentian Fathers in 1870 and now has campuses in Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island; it is the country's largest Catholic university (over 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students).  Yeshiva University, in Washington Heights, is a Jewish university rooted in America's oldest Yeshiva, founded in 1886. One of the nation's most prestigious conservatories, The Juilliard School, is located on the Upper West Side. New York Law School is a private law school in lower Manhattan and is one of the oldest independent law schools in the United States. The New York Academy of Sciences is a society of some 20,000 scientists of all disciplines from 150 countries. Primary and secondary education. Public schools. The New York City public school system is the largest in the world. More than 1.1 million students are taught in more than 1,700 public schools with a budget of $21 billion. The public school system is managed by the New York City Department of Education. It includes Empowerment Schools. Among New York City public high schools are selective specialized schools such as CUNY-run Hunter College High School (the public school which sends the highest percentage of its graduates to Ivy League schools in the United States; ranked as the top public high school in the United States), Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School The school that requires the highest cutoff of the SHSAT, and the teaching home of Pulitzer Prize winner Frank McCourt; often considered one of the best public high schools in the United States), Bronx High School of Science (which has the largest number of graduates who are Nobel Laureates of any high school in the world) and Brooklyn Technical High School (one of the few public schools that uses a college-style major system after their students' sophomore year, and one of the largest populated and largely constructed schools in the nation). Townsend Harris High School in Queens is another selective school situated on a bucolic campus that offers small class sizes compared to schools of equal rigor, where the average student takes two different foreign languages including Latin and/or Greek. The Brooklyn High School of the Arts is the only high school in the United States to offer a major in Historic Preservation. The High School of American Studies at Lehman College, and Staten Island Technical High School has rapidly become one of New York's hardest schools to get into, and was ranked by U.S. News & World Report the highest specialized high school in NYC, beating Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. Bard High School Early College is one of the few, tuition-free, early college entrance programs in the nation that provides graduates with a high school diploma and an Associate of Arts degree. Murry Bergtraum High School is the oldest business high school in Lower Manhattan that integrates an array of specialized courses such as shorthand, and MOS certification courses (including courses that are not offered elsewhere in the United States. The Harvey Milk High School is the only public high school in the United States for gay, lesbian, and transgendered students. Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, long considered the prototype for all performing art high schools across the world, has a very selective audition process. LaGuardia offers conservatory caliber training in the fields of dance, art, vocal music, instrumental music and drama. The movie ""Fame"" is based on this school and it has a long list of notable alumni. The High School of Art and Design is one of the oldest vocational schools in the United States, training students in the visual arts since 1936. School funding lawsuit. A constitutional challenge to the New York State school funding system was filed in 1993 by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. The lawsuit, ""CFE v. State of New York"", claims that the state's school finance system under-funds New York City public schools and denies its students their constitutional right to a sound basic education. The Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, ruled in 1996 that the New York State constitution requires that the state offer all children the opportunity for a ""sound basic education"". In 2001, State Supreme Court Justice Leland DeGrasse found that the current state school funding system was unconstitutional. Governor George Pataki appealed the decision, which was overturned in 2002 by the Appellate Division. CFE appealed to the Court of Appeals, which again found in favor of CFE in 2003. The Court of Appeals gave the State of New York until July 30, 2004 to comply with its order. The state failed to meet this deadline, however, and the court appointed three referees who were given until November 30, 2004 to submit a compliance plan to Justice Leland DeGrasse of the State Supreme Court. Justice DeGrasse agreed with the referees' recommendations and in 2005 ruled that New York City schools need nearly $15 billion to provide students with their constitutional right to the opportunity to receive a sound basic education. Governor Pataki appealed again to the Appellate Division. In 2006, however, the Appellate Division ordered the State Legislature to consider a plan to direct between $4.7 billion and $5.63 billion to New York City schools and upheld an earlier ruling to provide about $9.2 billion in capital funds to the school system over five years. New York City's public secondary schools include: Bard High School Early College, Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School, Hunter College High School, LaGuardia High School, Staten Island Technical High School, Stuyvesant High School, and Townsend Harris High School. The city is home to the largest Roman Catholic high school in the U.S., St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens, and the only official Italian-American school in the country, La Scuola d'Italia on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

The collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists, as well as numerous works of sculpture and porcelain. It also has furniture, enamel, and carpets. The Jewish Museum of New York was first established in 1904, when the Jewish Theological Seminary received a gift a 26 Jewish ceremonial art objects by Judge Mayer Sulzberger. The museum now boasts a collection 28,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, archaeological artifacts, and many other pieces important to the preservation of Jewish history and culture. Founded in 1969 by a group of Puerto Rican artists, educators, community activists and civic leaders, El Museo del Barrio is located at the top of Museum Mile in East Harlem, a neighborhood also called 'El Barrio'. Originally, the museum was a creation of the Nuyorican Movement and Civil Rights Movement, and primarily functioned as a neighborhood institution serving Puerto Ricans. With the increasing size of New York's Latino population, the scope of the museum is expanding. The American Museum of Natural History is a landmark of Manhattan's Upper West Side, with a staff of more than 1,200. The museum sponsors over 100 special field expeditions each year. The Museum is famous for its habitat groups of African, Asian and North American mammals, for the full-size model of a Blue Whale suspended in the hall of oceans, for the Haida carved and painted war canoe from the Pacific Northwest, and for the ""Star of India"", the largest blue sapphire in the world. The circuit of a complete floor is devoted to vertebrate evolution, including the world-famous dinosaur replicas. The Museum's anthropological collections are also outstanding: Halls of Asian Peoples and of Pacific Peoples, of Man in Africa, Native Americans in the United States collections, general Native American collections, and collections from Mexico and Central America. One of the premiere botanical gardens in the United States, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx was modeled after the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. With 48 different gardens and plant collections, nature enthusiasts can easily spend a day admiring the serene cascade waterfall, wetlands, a 50 acre (200,000 m²) tract of old-growth oaks, American beeches, cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees — some more than two centuries old. Garden highlights include an 1890s-vintage, wrought-iron framed, ""crystal-palace style"" greenhouse; the Peggy Rockefeller memorial rose garden (originally laid out by Beatrix Farrand in 1916); a Japanese rock garden; a 37 acre (150,000 m²) conifer collection, extensive research facilities including a propagation center, 50,000-volume library, and a herbarium archive of hundreds of thousands of botanical specimens dating back more than a century. At the heart of the Garden are 40 acres (162,000 m²) of virgin woodlands which represent the last stretch of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest itself is split by the Bronx River and includes a riverine canyon and rapids, and along its shores sits the landmark Lorillard snuff-grinding mill dating back to the 1840s. The Brooklyn Children's Museum is a general purpose museum in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Founded in 1899, it was the first museum in the world to cater specifically to children. The museum is currently undergoing extensive renovation and expansion. The New York Hall of Science is a hands-on science and technology center with more than 400 exhibits exploring biology, chemistry, and physics. It is located in one of the few remaining structures of the 1964 New York World's Fair. The Rubin Museum of Art is a museum dedicated to the collection, display, and preservation of the art of the Himalayas and surrounding regions, especially that of Tibet. It is located at 150 West 17th Street between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue in the Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City. The Education Department at the Rubin Museum of Art fosters a deeper experience with the art of the Himalayas through close observation, discovery, thinking, and emotion and encourage visitors to consider the interplay between art and culture, and to make personal connections to visual art through meaningful interactions. Scientific research. New York is a center of scientific research, particularly in medicine and the life sciences. The city has 15 nationally leading academic medical research institutions and medical centers. These include Rockefeller University, Beth Israel Medical Center, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, Mount Sinai Medical Center (where Jonas Salk, developer of the vaccine for polio as an intern) and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the medical schools of New York University. In the Bronx, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a major academic center. Brooklyn also hosts one of the country's leading urban medical centers, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, an academic medical research institution and the oldest hospital-based medical school in the United States. Professor Raymond Vahan Damadian, a pioneer in magnetic resonance imaging research, was part of the faculty from 1967 to 1977 and built the first MRI machine, the Indomitable, there. The New York Structural Biology Center, in upper Manhattan, is a highly regarded federally funded medical research center with the largest and most advanced cluster of high-field research magnets in the United States. More than 50 bioscience companies and two biotech incubators are located in the city, with as many as 30 companies spun out of local research institutions each year. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is a component laboratory of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Earth-Sun Exploration Division and a unit of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. Current research at GISS emphasizes a broad study of global climate change. It also conducts basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs. Rockefeller University, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and physics. Founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1901, the university has been the site of many important scientific breakthroughs. Rockefeller scientists established that DNA is the chemical basis of heredity, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can cause cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, developed methadone maintenance for people addicted to heroin, devised the AIDS ""cocktail"" drug therapy, and identified the weight-regulating hormone leptin. Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners have been associated with the university, an amazing figure considering that Rockefeller University houses a relatively small amount of labs. The Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory in The Bronx, built with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New York State and New York City, and named for its largest private donor, is a major new research institution at the New York Botanical Garden opened in 2006. The laboratory is a pure research institution, with projects more diverse than research in universities and pharmaceutical companies. The laboratory's research emphasis is on plant genomics, the study of how genes function in plant development. One question scientists hope to answer is Darwin's ""abominable mystery""; when, where, and why flowering plants emerged. The laboratory's research also furthers the discipline of molecular systematics, the study of DNA as evidence that can reveal the evolutionary history and relationships of plant species. Staff scientists also study plant use in immigrant communities in New York City and the genetic mechanisms by which neurotoxins are produced in some plants, work that may be related to nerve disease in humans. A staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time from all over the world; since 1890s scientists from the New York Botanical Garden have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions across the planet to collect plants in the wild. At the plant chemistry laboratory chemical compounds from plants are extracted to create a library of the chemistry of the world's plants and stored in a DNA storage room with 20 freezers that store millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species. To protect them during winter power outages, there is a backup 300-kilowatt electric generator. "
wikipedia-3926004," Dinosaur Island  Dinosaur Island is an island that has appeared in various comic book series published by DC Comics. The island is not the same ""Dinosaur Island"" that appeared in ""Batman"" #35 (June 1946). That story by Bill Finger and Bob Kane involved a ""Dinosaur Island"" amusement park that contained robotic dinosaurs. Publication history. In ""Star-Spangled War Stories"" #90 (April 1960), Robert Kanigher created the Dinosaur Island that is in use in the DC universe today for his feature ""The War That Time Forgot"". It is located in the South Pacific of DC's main shared universe and it is populated by living dinosaurs. Fictional history. Dinosaur Island seems to have first been discovered by Enemy Ace in 1927 when he flew Bat Lash, Biff Bradley, General Joseph Stilwell, and ""Chop-Chop"" (presumably the father of the Blackhawks member) to the island on a mission for Chiang Kai-shek. The island had long been a legend to the Chinese people (known as Dragon Island at the time) and was believed to hold the mystical Swords of Fan. During this mission, the adventurers encounter Vandal Savage and Miss Fear, in addition to the dangerous dinosaurs. This tale appears in the ""Guns of the Dragon"" mini-series. During World War II, several United States submarines seemingly disappear after encountering an area of seismic disturbances. Marines land on a nearby island hoping to find survivors, but instead find that the earthquakes has awakened the remote island's resident dinosaur population. The prehistoric beasts had been preserved via suspended animation for centuries. With their weapons essentially useless, the squad of Marines barely escapes to tell the tale. Despite the presence of dinosaurs, the U.S. government consider the island a valuable strategic location in its war against Japan. Several expeditions and operations take place at the island. The island is also used as a proving ground for the automated soldiers designated G.I. Robot, which prove to be no match for the dinosaurs' ferocious might. The Creature Commandos, the Flying Boots, and the original Suicide Squad all take part in missions on the island during World War II. Post-War expeditions have theorized that the island exists in a state of temporal flux. Black Canary of the Birds of Prey lands on the island in modern times only to find it still inhabited by Japanese soldiers who are keeping Gunner and Sarge of ""The Losers"" in a P.O.W. camp. The ""Suicide Squad"" series reveals that a post-War mission to the island by Sgt. Rock (allegedly) and Bulldozer explains why they haven't aged as much since World War II due to temporal fluctuations. The veracity of this story may be in dispute, as Bulldozer later cryptically announces that Sgt. Rock died in World War II. Writer/artist Darwyn Cooke uses the island in his out-of-continuity series ', where he connects the island with the dawn of the Silver Age. In this series, the island is portrayed as the main antagonist, a sentient being called the Centre which has existed on the Earth since before the dawn of the human race. Feeling threatened by humanity's development of nuclear weapons, the Centre decides to end all life on Earth. In New Frontier, the Centre is portrayed as a living island with the ability to hover over great distances and spawn grotesque mutant dinosaurs to attack or defend itself. The island is currently the setting of the twelve-part series ""The War That Time Forgot"". "
wikipedia-3926218," Trimethadione  Trimethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant. It is most commonly used to treat epileptic conditions that are resistant to other treatments. Fetal trimethadione syndrome. If administered during pregnancy, fetal trimethadione syndrome may result causing facial dysmorphism (short upturned nose, slanted eyebrows), cardiac defects, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and mental retardation. The fetal loss rate while using trimethadione has been reported to be as high as 87%. Chemistry. Trimethadione, 3,5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, may be synthesized by methylating 5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione with dimethylsulfate. Starting 5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione is in turn synthesized by the cyclocondensation of the ester of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid with urea. "

wikipedia-3926430," Box of Rain  ""Box of Rain"" is a song by the Grateful Dead, from their 1970 album ""American Beauty"". The song was composed by bassist Phil Lesh and lyricist Robert Hunter, and sung by Lesh. In later years, the song was a favorite and the crowd would shout ""Let Phil sing!"" to hear the song. The song. ""Box of Rain"" is a song that is drawn from American folk and country musical roots. This is true of many Grateful Dead tunes, and most of the songs on ""American Beauty"" and their other 1970 release ""Workingman's Dead"". As the first song on ""American Beauty"", it was also the first Grateful Dead song released on record to feature Phil Lesh as the lead vocalist. The song also featured two musicians who are not in the band. Dave Torbert played bass, while Lesh played acoustic guitar. David Nelson (of New Riders of the Purple Sage) plays the lead guitar with a Fender Telecaster equipped with a Parsons/White B-Bender, while Jerry Garcia plays the piano. Lyrics. According to lyricist Hunter, Lesh ""wanted a song to sing to his dying father and had composed a piece complete with every vocal nuance but the words. If ever a lyric 'wrote itself,' this did—as fast as the pen would pull."" Lesh practiced the song driving to the nursing home where his father lay with terminal cancer. Many of the lyrics to this song are reminiscent of the song ""Ripple"", which opens the second side of the album. Images of water abound in both, as well as references to ""broken"" or ""hand-me-down"" ""thoughts"". The image of a ""box of rain"" originates, according to Hunter: ""By 'box of rain,' I meant the world we live on, but 'ball' of rain didn't have the right ring to my ear, so box it became, and 'I don't know who put it there.'"" The line ""moth before a flame"" echoes several proverbs, such as ""the fate of the moth in the flame""—Aeschylus, ""Fragments"" (Fragment #288). The line ""long long time to be gone and a short time to be there"" echoes the old-time classic ""Little Birdie"", which includes the line ""I've a short while to be here, and a long time to be gone."" In one of Carl Hiaasen's novels, the main character is in a shelter for children stranded by the hurricane, and in a particularly tender moment, sings Box of Rain to the child. Performance history. ""Box of Rain"" debuted on September 17, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City during the acoustic portion of the show. That performance was (perhaps significantly given the song's emotional burden for Lesh) its sole appearance for nearly two years. The Grateful Dead reintroduced it during the Fall of 1972 and played it on and off during 1972 and 1973, then dropping it and only reviving it 750+ performances later, playing it on March 20, 1986, at the Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. After that, the song was frequently played in response to chants from the audience. Before the death of Jerry Garcia, ""Box of Rain"" was the last song ever performed live at a Grateful Dead concert during the final encore at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 9, 1995. "
wikipedia-3926553," Same-sex marriage in Portugal  Same-sex marriage has been legal in Portugal since 5 June 2010. The government of Prime Minister José Sócrates introduced a bill for legalization in December 2009; it was passed by the Assembly of the Republic in February 2010. The bill was declared legally valid by the Portuguese Constitutional Court in April 2010. On 17 May 2010, President Aníbal Cavaco Silva ratified the law and Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and the eighth country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. The law was published in the official journal Diário da Republica on 31 May 2010 and became effective on 5 June 2010. Constitutional Court ruling. On 1 February 2006, a lesbian couple applied for a marriage licence. Their application was refused, but the couple, Teresa Pires and Helena Paixão, promised to challenge the ban in court, saying that it discriminated against them on the basis of sexual orientation, where this type of discrimination is banned by the 1976 constitution. Discrimination based on sexual orientation was made illegal in 2004. In May 2007, the court rejected the motion and they appealed to the Portuguese Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court received the case in July 2007. Helena and Teresa's lawyer, Luís Grave Rodrigues, presented their allegations on 19 October 2007, including seven legal opinions (""pareceres"") from Portuguese professors of law arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. On 31 July 2009, the Constitutional Court decided on a 3–2 vote that the constitution does not demand the recognition of same-sex marriage, but also does not oppose it, and that the decision must be made by the Assembly of the Republic. Legislative action. The BE and PEV's 2008 bills. Two bills to legalize same-sex marriage were presented to Parliament on 10 October 2008. The bills were introduced separately by the Left Bloc (BE) and Green Party (PEV). Both bills were rejected by parliament on opposition from the governing Socialist Party and the main opposition Social Democratic Party. The Government's 2009-2010 bill. Prime Minister José Sócrates stated on 18 January 2009 that, if re-elected in the September 2009 elections, he planned to introduce a bill to allow same-sex couples the right to marry. While the bill did not contemplate adoption, most LGBT organizations in Portugal supported the measure as an important step towards equality. In March 2009, Jorge Lacão, the Secretary of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, confirmed that the Socialist government intended to legalize same-sex marriage if re-elected in 2009. Manuela Ferreira Leite, the leader of the conservative Social Democratic Party, expressed her disapproval on the recognition of same-sex marriage. In May 2009, a grassroots movement, ""The Movement for Equality in Access to Civil Marriage"", was formed to campaign for the proposed same-sex marriage law. It attracted the support of several Portuguese celebrities, including Nobel Prize winner José Saramago and the Mayor of Lisbon António Costa. In October 2009, the newly re-elected José Sócrates made an assurance that the Socialist Party would move ahead with its campaign promise of same-sex marriage. The proposition received strong support from the Left Bloc, with its parliamentary leader presenting a proposed amendment to the Family Code which would make the definition of marriage gender-neutral. In mid-October 2009 Jorge Lacão said it would be likely that same-sex marriage would be legalised in early 2010. On 3 November 2009, José Ribeiro e Castro, a member of the CDS-PP, called for a referendum but the Socialist Party and Left Bloc rejected that idea. On 4 November Francisco Assis, the parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party, said same-sex marriage bill would be voted soon and confirmed that the bill would not allow same-sex couples to adopt children. On 17 December 2009, the Government approved the same-sex marriage bill. On 8 January 2010, after a debate, which included the intervention of the Prime Minister, the Portuguese Parliament passed the bill establishing same-sex marriage in its first reading. On 10 February, the Constitutional Affairs Committee of Parliament approved the bill. The final parliamentary vote took place on 11 February, with the bill being approved. On 24 February 2010, the Constitutional Affairs Committee sent the bill to the Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva.  On 13 March 2010, the President asked the Constitutional Court to verify whether the bill was constitutional. On 8 April 2010, the Portuguese Constitutional Court ruled (11–2) for the constitutionality of the bill, with three members concluding that the Constitution required the recognition of same-sex marriages. The ruling was published in the official gazette on 28 April, giving President Aníbal Cavaco Silva twenty days to sign, or veto, the bill.  On 17 May 2010, the President signed the bill. The law was published in Diário da República on 31 May 2010 and became effective on 5 June 2010. On 7 June Teresa Pires and Helena Paixão became the first lesbian same-sex couple to marry in Portugal. Same-sex adoption bills. On 24 February 2012, the parliament rejected two bills allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. However, on 17 May 2013, the Parliament passed a law allowing same-sex married couples to adopt their partner's children (i.e. step-child adoption). A law allowing full joint adoption was defeated on a 104-77 vote. Opposition. A number of groups opposed legalizing same-sex marriage during the process of discussion and continue to do so after ratification.  The Catholic Church in Portugal was opposed to the law and, while Portugal is a constitutional secular country, its status as a historically Catholic country was also a reason for the media sensationalism which heightened the controversy over the law.  On 8 January 2010, the parliament rejected a motion calling to the national referendum about same-sex marriage.  In February, 5,000 people demonstrated against legalization of same-sex marriage in a march in Lisbon.  On 13 May 2010, during an official visit to Portugal four days before the ratification of the law, Pope Benedict XVI, affirmed his opposition to same-sex marriage, describing it as ""insidious and dangerous"". Marriage norms. On 19 July 2010, Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado published the following rules on marriage: - Marriages conducted abroad must be transcribed by civil registries even if they were made before the approval date of marriage equality; - Marriages performed under alternative legislation to civil marriage, such as civil partnerships and civil unions, can not be transcribed; - Foreign nationals can marry even if marriage between same-sex couples is not recognized in their country of origin; - Same-sex foreign nationals can marry in Portugal without the need to establish residency; - Co-adoptions with same-sex couples performed abroad are not recognized in Portugal.

wikipedia-3926645," Ilie Dumitrescu  Ilie Dumitrescu (; born 6 January 1969 in Bucharest) is a Romanian former football player and coach, who was last manager of Steaua Bucureşti. A tricky forward, he shot to fame when his frontline partnership with Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Răducioiu led the Romania national team to the 1994 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal, eliminating Argentina en route. Football career. Dumitrescu joined the Steaua Bucureşti Academy in 1977 at the age of 8, making his way through all the youth teams and play for the first squad in April 1987. Even now he is renowned as the best player Steaua Bucureşti Academy ever produced along with Dan Petrescu. After making his debut in Divizia A he is loaned to FC Olt to gain more experience. At Steaua, a team which won the European Cup in the previous year was no room for an 18-year-old. But at FC Olt was a different story, as Dumitrescu did catch the first eleven from the very beginning, playing as left full back. This was not, however, a position he enjoyed, as he was a creative player. During his time with FC Olt, Mircea Lucescu the famous Romanian coach noticed him and predicted a fruitful career. It was just like Lucescu said. Once returned to Steaua Bucureşti, full with talent and ambition, he makes himself way to the first eleven at the age of only 19, becoming an important part of the squad, playing alongside big names such as Marius Lăcătuş and Gheorghe Hagi. In 1989 he makes debut for Romania, being used as a substitute in a game against Greece. From there the 1990 FIFA World Cup was only one step away, an opportunity he could not miss. Despite playing two games in Italy, Dumitrescu's services are not requested by a Western European club and he returned to play for his old team and, as captain, leads it to winning the championship in 1993 and playing in the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners' Cup in the same year. 1994 was a World Cup year and Dumitrescu was there, playing all the five games his team played in America and scoring two very important goals against Argentina in their famous 3–2 victory. The first after 11 minutes, a stunning free kick from a tight angle curled over the Argentine goal keeper. Minutes later Argentina had drew level through a penalty converted by Batistuta but slick passing in a counter-attack with Hagi resulted in another fine goal for Dumitrescu just 7 minutes after his first. Dumitrescu was also instrumental in the 3rd goal. He played the ball after a great run to Hagi who scored a vital goal which proved to be the winner. His performance opened the doors to the quarter-finals, the best performance Romania ever gained. Impressed by his performance in America, the representatives of Tottenham Hotspur were keen to offer him a contract. The North London side paid £2.6 million for Dumitrescu.[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-tottenham-sign-dumitrescu-for-pounds-26m-ardiles-shows-ambition-by-buying-romanian-world-cup-hero-and-chasing-two-brazilians-as-venables-prepares-for-latin-test-1416799.html] Just days after becoming a Tottenham Hotspur player, Dumitrescu found his name involved in a scandal. The British tabloid newspaper News of the World wrote an article about Dumitrescu chasing the services of prostitutes. The story later proved to be untrue, but Tottenham were unwilling to play Dumitrescu during the scandal and he was loaned out to Sevilla FC, with the La Liga side given an option to buy him during the loan. Dumitrescu had a good time in Southern Spain but the club baulked at the transfer fee Tottenham demanded. Dumitrescu returned to England. After playing in the first half of the 1995 – 96 Premiership season and failing to impress, Dumitrescu was sold to West Ham United, where Harry Redknapp wanted to make him the player he once was. Dumitrescu played only 10 games before encountering problems with his work permit. His contract with West Ham was broken, leaving him free agent. In the summer of 1996 he signed a contract with Club América in Mexico and then after one year he switched to their rivals Atlante F.C.. After two years in Mexico, Dumitrescu returned to Steaua Bucureşti in 1998. Halfway through the season he announced his retirement as a professional player aged only 29. Career as player agent. In 1998 he established a company called ""Sport & Business World"", as he was keen to start a new career as a player agent. It was however a very short career without any relevant success. Career as coach. In 2000 he was made manager of Oţelul Galaţi, from Romania's Divizia A. It was the beginning of a new career for Dumitrescu. From Galaţi he moved to FC Braşov and then Cypriot side Alki Larnaca in 2001–02. Here he won promotion to the Cypriot First Division and his team started the season very well, beating some of the best sides in Cyprus. However at the end of the season his team finished 11th. He then took the head coach role of the Romanian Under 21 side. But Dumitrescu lasted only 6 weeks in the role [http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=38123.html].  Subsequently he took control of FCM Bacău in Divizia A. However, after a disappointing season, Dumitrescu resigned in May 2003, leaving FCM Bacău in the relegation zone. Dumitrescu went again to Cyprus, this time for Apollon Limassol. By playing the Italian defensive system catenaccio, they won 12 of their first 13 matches and Dumitrescu was named the best manager in Cyprus for the year 2004. Dumitrescu soon moved on to his 6th club side, being named manager of the Greek side AEK Athens FC in February 2004. His roving managerial career continued as he left AEK to join Egaleo, also from the Greek Super League. The next three years found him at three other Greek clubs: Akratitos, Kallithea and PAOK. Dumitrescu was criticised for his style of play by PAOK fans. Despite only joining the club in February, he resigned in October. After 3 years without a club he became manager of Panthrakikos in May 2009, but was sacked after only one game. On 11 August 2010 he returned to Romania to take the manager post at Steaua Bucureşti only to leave the post six weeks later, citing ""I can't stay somewhere I'm not wanted,"". Dumitrescu had managed 13 teams in only 9 years. Trivia. Dumitrescu is an art lover and has his own art gallery in Bucharest. "
wikipedia-3926661," Florin Răducioiu  Florin Valeriu Răducioiu (born 17 March 1970 in Bucharest) is a former Romanian football striker, who played for Dinamo Bucureşti, A.C. Milan, Brescia Calcio, West Ham United, RCD Espanyol, VfB Stuttgart and A.S. Monaco. He played for Romania at the 1990 FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy, the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, and England's UEFA Euro 1996. Club career. Răducioiu was a product of Dinamo Bucureşti. Mircea Lucescu, former Dinamo coach, saw his skills and, as a feature of his philosophy towards football to promote young players, gave Răducioiu the chance to play at the highest level at the age of 17 years. By the beginning of 1988–1989, Răducioiu was first-choice in Lucescu's team. He made an impressive debut in European football by reaching the quarterfinals of the 1988–89 Cup Winners' Cup (ousted by U.C. Sampdoria in the quarterfinals, on away goals) and finishing second in the league. By 1989–90, Răducioiu was one of Romania's finest players, and that year was to be the most significant of his early career. He won the Romanian championship and the cup (hat-trick in the final against Steaua), reaching the semifinals of the 1989–90 Cup Winners' Cup, where Dinamo was defeated by RSC Anderlecht. After two seasons in Serie A, Răducioiu joined A.C. Milan in 1993–94, making only seven appearances and scoring two goals, but winning the UEFA Champions League. In 1994 he went to Spain to play for RCD Espanyol. Having scored his country's only goal in Euro96 manager Harry Redknapp signed him for West Ham United in 1996. Most famously, he scored a goal against Manchester United after being criticized by Harry Redknapp for going shopping with his wife at Harvey Nichols on a previous match day; a claim Răducioiu denies. Despite showing promise, he never adapted to the pace and competitive nature of the English game, making no real impact at Upton Park. He scored three goals during his spell with the Hammers. In addition to his goal against Manchester United he scored against Stockport County in the League Cup and Sunderland in the league. After his short underachieving spell at the East London club, having fallen out with manager Redknapp, he was transferred back to Espanyol, having scored just two goals in the Premier League. Răducioiu retired in 2004, after a short stint with modest French side US Créteil-Lusitanos. He had a short spell as a sports agent and as sporting director at Dinamo Bucharest. He is one of the two professional football players (alongside Christian Poulsen) to have plied his trade in the top five European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France). International career. Răducioiu debuted for the Romania in a friendly game against Israel on 25 April 1990, playing for 58 minutes before he was replaced. Răducioiu made his FIFA World Cup debut in 1990 against the Soviet Union at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, aged 20. Appearing in three games for Romania, he finished the tournament without scoring, and Romania fell to the Republic of Ireland in the second round, in a penalty shootout. Răducioiu had to wait until the last game of 1990 to score his first goal. He scored for Romania in a 6–0 victory over San Marino on 5 December in a qualifying match for Euro 1992, only to double his account in the next game in San Marino, as the Romanians won 3–1. The year 1993 would be significantly more successful for Răducioiu internationally, as he scored two goals against Czechoslovakia in Košice, even though Romania lost 5–2. Răducioiu's second goal came in the 55th minute, to tie the game at 2–2. However, Slovak player Peter Dubovsky scored a second half hat trick to beat Romania. His first goal came just four minutes after Răducioiu's second, and in the final eight minutes, Dubosky scored twice to win the game, even though the Czechoslovak had had two players sent off. An even greater success for Florin would come three months later when in Toftir, he managed to score all four of Romania's goals against the Faroe Islands, becoming the first Romanian player to score four goals for the national team in modern times, a record equaled only by Gheorghe Popescu in 1997 against Liechstenstein. Florin also scored a penalty kick against Belgium in the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup. In the last group game of qualifying, Răducioiu scored another goal against Wales finishing a nice team effort after a pass from Ilie Dumitrescu. This late goal, coming in the 83rd minute, sent Romania to the top of its group from the potential third place in the case that the game had ended 1–0. This win sent Romania to the 1994 World Cup. There, Răducioiu would help Romania to its most successful World Cup campaign ever, scoring four goals in the tournament. In 1994, he fared even better, scoring four goals in the tournament as Romania advanced to the quarterfinals. Răducioiu scored two goals against Colombia during the qualifying round, and later plugged two more in a quarterfinal loss to Sweden. Due to rule changes, had the match against Sweden been played two years later, Romania would have advanced to the semifinals; Răducioiu's second goal was the first scored during extra time, and under later rules, this tally would have been considered a golden goal (instead, Kennet Andersson also scored in the additional period, tying the game, and Sweden eventually won 5–4 on penalties, as Răducioiu scored on the first penalty attempt for Romania). In Euro 1996, as Romania lost all three group stage matches, Răducioiu netted the nation's only goal, in a 1–2 loss against Spain. "
wikipedia-3926700," Lapel  Lapels are the folded flaps of cloth on the front of a jacket or coat, and are most commonly found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric around the back of the neck. There are three basic forms of lapels: notched, peaked and shawl. Notched lapels, the most common, are usually seen on business suits. Peaked lapels are more formal, and nearly always used on double breasted jackets or coats. Shawl lapels are usually carried by dinner jackets. Types of lapel. Notched lapel. The notched lapel (American English), step lapel or step collar (British English) is sewn to the collar at an angle, creating a step effect. This is the standard on single breasted suits, and is used on nearly all suit jackets, blazers, and sports jackets. The notched lapel double-breasted jacket is a rare setting. The size of the notch can vary, and a small notch is called ""fishmouth"". This was the first type of lapel to appear. Peaked lapel. The peaked lapel (American English), double breasted style lapel or pointed lapel (British English), is the most formal, featuring on double-breasted jackets, all formal coats such as a tailcoat or morning coat, and also commonly with a dinner jacket (both single and double breasted). In the late 1920s and 1930s, the single breasted peaked lapel jacket was considered a very stylish design. The feature was carried into day clothing by the increasing popularity of the peaked dinner jacket. The ability to properly cut peak lapels on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors. Shawl lapel. The shawl lapel, roll collar, or shawl collar is a continuous curve. Originally seen on the Victorian smoking jacket, it is now most common on the dinner jacket (tuxedo). This similarly began as informal eveningwear, and was then made in both more and less formal versions, depending on the situation in which it was to be used. Lapel features. Lapels have a buttonhole on the left, which is intended to hold a boutonnière, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. To hold the flower properly, a loop is fixed to the back of the lapel. For symmetry, double breasted suits often have a button hole on each lapel. A lapel pin is also sometimes worn. The width of the lapel is a widely varying aspect of suits, and has changed widely over the years. Some designers maintain however that most stylish lapel width does not change, and that the lapel ""should extend to just a fraction less than the halfway mark between the collar and shoulder line"". Origin. The ""usual"" style of lapel (the notched lapel) originated in older types of jacket or coat that buttoned to the neck, by unbuttoning and turning back the upper part of the closure at an angle indoors or in hot weather, and then removing the upper buttons. The upper points are derived from the end corners of the collar. This can be duplicated by similarly turning back the closure in a modern button-to-the-neck garment such as an outdoor coat or a boilersuit. Sometimes when caught outside in bad weather in a lapelled jacket and nothing over it, its wearer may unfold the lapels and hold them that way to temporarily reproduce the ancestral to-the-neck closure. As tailcoats evolved rapidly among the wealthy during the Regency period, various styles of closure saw popularity, from fastenings at the top, the middle, or even hanging open. The turn-down collar popular on earlier garments like the frock was succeeded by long lapels folded down to below the waist (fashionably tightly nipped in). Invariably, there were long rows of buttons down the front, most of which did not fasten; in fact even into the late Victorian era, all frock coats had a long row of button holes on the lapel, long since obsolete. As buttoning styles changed, the loosely folded front of the coat correspondingly shifted shape, and the ""V"" then formed by the meeting of the fold and the collar continues now in the traditional shape of notched and peaked lapels, both of which originate from that period. Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased and their form was more static, varying only in details such as height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then lengthened to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period was the use of the revers in the construction of the lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch to morning coats and lounge suits. Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts. Some historians of dress such as Bernard Rudofsky have ridiculed the evolution of jacket lapels into ""vastly unnecessary flaps"" and ""decorative rudiments,"" while others have celebrated the transformation of lapels into ""fetishes"" as part and parcel of fashion as expression. Lapelless jackets. Though less common among men's suits in the west, other jacket styles feature no lapels. Jackets with mandarin collars, also called stand collars, band collars or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, such as the British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and ghillie collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit. "
wikipedia-3926798," Galactic Milieu Series  The Galactic Milieu Series of science fiction novels by Julian May is the sequel (and prequel) to her ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"". It comprises four novels: ""Intervention"", ""Jack the Bodiless"", ""Diamond Mask"" and ""Magnificat"". The series involves several religious and philosophical themes, including references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The novels. The series begins with ""Intervention: A Root Tale to the Galactic Milieu and a Vinculum between it and The Saga of Pliocene Exile"" (ISBN 0-395-43782-2, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987). This was released in one volume in the UK, but in mass market paperback in the USA as two volumes: ""Surveillance"" and ""Metaconcert"". May calls ""Intervention"" a ""vinculum"", or link-tale, between the ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"" and the Milieu trilogy proper. However, it is a near-essential introduction to the Milieu trilogy as well as a balanced stand-alone work.  ""Jack the Bodiless"" (ISBN 0-679-40950-5, New York: Knopf, 1991) is the first book of the trilogy proper, followed by ""Diamond Mask"" (ISBN 0-679-43310-4, New York: Knopf, 1994), and ""Magnificat"" (ISBN 0-679-44177-8, New York: Knopf, 1996). Religious and philosophical themes. The series includes multiple references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, including the concepts of the Omega Point and the Noosphere, which are applied to May's description of galactic mental Unity. The series title echoes Teilhard's 1957 book ""Le Milieu Divin"". The Remillard family are Catholic, and on several occasions family members discuss their faith. The most notable example occurs in the first part of Chapter 24 of ""Jack the Bodiless"", where Teresa Kendall explains Christianity to her unborn son. ""Jack the Bodiless"" begins with a set of quotations, including the Spanish proverb ""God writes straight with crooked lines."" This proverb summarises the plot of the whole series, in which tragedies and disasters (particularly the Metapsychic Rebellion) result in ultimate good (particularly the repentance and transformation of Marc Remillard, through which the Galactic Milieu is formed). The Rebellion is thus a ""Felix culpa"". Julian May's description of ""metapsychic"" abilities explicitly refers to the concepts of auras (particularly in Part III of ""Intervention"") and chakras (particularly in discussing the feeding of the ""Hydra""). Aspects of May's Universe. Alien races. The Lylmik are the oldest race in the Galaxy, having been shepherded to mental Unity or ""coadunation"" by the entity known as Atoning Unifex. They created the Galactic Milieu and in turn mentored the Krondaku, Gi, Simbiari, and Poltroyans. The Krondaku are large tentacled invertebrate ""monsters"", the Gi are feathered hermaphrodites with a well-developed aesthetic sense, the Simbiari are green and slimy, while the Poltroyans are small purple humanoids who most resemble human beings both physically and mentally. Planets. Events of the novels take place on several planets: Earth; the Concilium Orb, an artificial planet constructed by the Lylmik, and the seat of the galactic Council; Hibernia, an Irish-dominated human colony; Caledonia, a Scottish-dominated human colony; Denali, a snow-covered planet popular as a holiday destination; and the human colony of Okanagon. Apart from the home planets and colonies of the alien races, a number of other planets are also mentioned in passing. ""Metapsychic"" powers. Julian May describes five categories of ""metapsychic"" powers in the series: creation, coercion, psychokinesis, farsensing and redaction. Each of these powers is associated with a colour, as originally described in the ""Saga of Pliocene Exile"". Creativity is the ability to create illusions and manipulate energy. In its strongest form, it can involve permanent changes of matter from one kind to another, as when Jack creates flowers from waste. The same level of power can also be used to create mental lasers, and the ""Metapsychic Rebellion"" causes considerable damage with such mental weapons, produced by brains amplified with cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment. Rogi possess creative abilities, though unreliable ones, and these occasionally help him in moments of need. Coercion is the ability of metapsychic mind control over other people. For example, in ""Magnificat"", Denis uses metapsychic coercion to manipulate Rogi to climb Mt. Washington. Psychokinesis (PK) is the ability to move physical objects through space metapsychically. Farsensing is the ability to communicate with others and to sense remotely via metapsychic means, much like telepathy, clairvoyance, or remote viewing. In ""Intervention"", the ability of farsensing (initially called ""ultrasensing"") to locate hidden weapons becomes geopolitically important. Finally, Redaction provides the ability for mental healing. Dorothea MacDonald has very strong redactive powers. These five mental powers can be latent, meaning that, while present, they cannot be consciously used. On the other hand, operant powers are available for conscious, controlled use. Higher capabilities within operancy include Master, Grand Master, and Paramount Grand Master levels. Jack, Marc, and Dorothea are all (eventually) Paramounts. Julian May describes collaborative as well as individual mental powers. A metaconcert is a synchronised use of mental powers by more than one person, as when Jack and Dorothea tackle the geological problems of Caledonia. The ultimate extension of such collaboration is the mental Unity which the Lylmik are fostering in the galaxy. Plots of the novels. Intervention. The book follows the Remillard family of New Hampshire from the years immediately after World War II through an increasingly turbulent world, in which various ""metapsychic"" humans manoeuvre in secret to direct the destiny of the human race. The Remillards play a central role in this story, though the narrator, Rogatien ""Uncle Rogi"" Remillard, is often an alienated observer rather than a central participant. At the same time, the earth is under surveillance by representatives of a galactic culture (the ""Galactic Milieu"" of the series title), who monitor the human race's fitness for admission into the wider galactic community. Interwoven with this narrative are glimpses of the time after the main action of the series, drawing together threads from it and the Pliocene Exile series. ""Intervention"" climaxes with the Great Intervention, the revelation of this wider galactic society. This sets the stage for the more focused story May has to tell in the remainder of the series.  This deals with the history of several family lines with strong metapsychic potential, especially the Remillards. This line begins with twins Rogatien (Rogi) and Donatien (Don), whose mother died giving birth to them. They discover that they have unusual mental abilities (which admittedly turn out to be far less than those of later generations of metapyschics). Rogi is a milder mannered man, who becomes sterile through mumps. Don is distrustful and malicious, but handsome and charming, and steals Rogi's girlfriend Marie Madeleine ""Sunny"" Fabré. From an early age, Rogi was visited by an entity he called ""the Family Ghost"", and it is this entity who commanded Rogi to write his memoirs. The Ghost first rescued Rogi as a child, and many years later rescued Don after Rogi tried to kill him in a rage for stealing his girlfriend. The Ghost tells Rogi that he is sterile, but would have an important role in guiding Don's key descendants. Rogi becomes close to Don and Sunny's firstborn child Denis. Denis is a precocious child, and quickly learns to master many metapsychic faculties, greatly exceeding those of Rogi and Don, in addition to excelling intellectually. Rogi becomes like a real father to him, while Don is always out getting drunk at night. Rogi and Denis start to search for people with similar powers. Don become jealous of Denis's powers but, though Denis's young coercion, is rendered unable to hurt him. Meanwhile, Don and Sunny raise their nine other children, including the monstrously evil second-born Victor, who terrorizes his younger siblings and suppresses their mental powers. Don focuses upon Victor as Denis grows up, seeming to shape him into a vigorous athletic counterpart to Denis's intellectual existence. The more sinister nature of Victor's influences becomes apparent in later volumes. Don reacts against Rogi's influence upon his children, but cannot overcome Denis's attachment to his uncle. Rogi leaves for a job as a hotel manager, where Denis can visit during the holidays. Rogi worries about Denis's education, as his local school is not challenging, but Don does not see education as something to invest in for his children - especially for Denis. Rogi learns of a Jesuit monastic school and manages to get Don to allow him to send Denis there. This leads to Denis attending Dartmouth College due to a new program for ""special students."" He becomes prominent in many fields, particularly psychology and the understanding of ""metapsychic"" abilities, eventually becoming the ""Grandfather of Metapsychology"". Subsequent research yields results in many places in the world and Denis organizes yearly meetings within the secret metapsychic community.  At the same time, Victor is plotting with the sociopathic gangster metapsychic Kieran O'Connor to bring down the government with their metapsychic powers. This culminates in a showdown at the end of the book where Denis calls out to all the present and absent metapsychics of goodwill to join in a ""metaconcert"" against an attack by Victor and Kieran. The watching Milieu agents invisible in the sky hear this call, and the subsequent metaconcert, and therefore intervene. Victor, meanwhile, goes after Rogi who has learned too much. Through his metapsychic power of ""creativity"", Rogi uses a mental laser to put Victor into a vegetative state. Rogi never understood how he could have overcome such a powerful metapsychic as Victor, until the Family Ghost reveals decades later that he assisted. Jack the Bodiless. As the Milieu trilogy proper begins with ""Jack the Bodiless"", humankind, led by the Remillard family, is awaiting acceptance into the Galactic Milieu. With Earth's government being overseen by one of the alien races (Simbiari) ultimately under the authority of the Galactic Milieu, harsh laws (including eugenics laws) are instituted, which fuels feelings of suspicion in both earth's normal and metapsychic population. Denis by now has fathered many children, the youngest of whom (Paul) is elected leader of Humanity. Marc, (Paul's firstborn with Teresa — a grandchild of Don's via Rogi's quondam amoureuse, Elaine) is the most powerful human metapsychic known at that time, who also has a genius-level intellect. Paul & Teresa started Marc's education while he was still in utero, which was by then becoming an accepted practice.  Also born, at Victor's deathbed, was Fury. This is a sociopathic entity that has its own agenda for the Galactic Milieu and the Remillard family in particular. Fury in turn ‘created’ from the minds of five unborn metapsychic fetuses, a physical monster called The Hydra to do its bidding. Following a number of failed pregnancies' Teresa has her reproductive license revoked (under the interdict, metaphysics must have permission to have children). Teresa then loses her ability to sing, and thereby loses Paul’s attention.  Sometime later Teresa regains her voice and becomes illegally pregnant with the last of their children, and when Marc farsenses emotional problems over her pregnancy he visits his mother to investigate. Upon learning of his mother’s pregnancy, Marc takes it upon himself to hide Teresa and his future brother in the icy Canadian wilderness. Marc realises that Rogi is the only family member that would be empathetic enough to help, and recruits him for this purpose. Marc fakes a “canoeing accident” so that the Remillard family and the Magistratum of the Milieu believe them dead, and after many months in the wilderness, Rogi assists Teresa in the birth, and Jon Remillard, the future “Saint Jack the Bodiless”, is born. Although Jack has the outward appearance of a normal human child, his intellect and mental prowess rapidly set him apart from the rest of humankind, as does the fact that his body begins to generate inoperable and incurable tumours that are slowly overwhelming him. Despite the fact that Jack possesses each of the five higher mindpowers (also known as metafaculties) at the highest known level (Paramount Grand Master), he is incapable of effecting change in his own physiology. The Lylmik, the oldest and most powerful of the alien races in the milieu, veto his euthanasia and leave it up to Jack. An attack by Fury on Jack as he lies in his hospital room, leads to an evolutionary jump in which Jack discards his physical form and metamorposes into his final state as a disembodied brain. Diamond Mask. The second book deals mainly with Dorothea MacDonald on the Scottish world of Caledonia. Dorothea lives with her father and her brother amid several step brothers and sisters. Dorothea's mother and other relatives are killed in an attack by the entity known as Hydra, a “metapsychic entity” that Fury uses as an assassin. Hydra consists of four (formerly five) metapsychics who can mind-meld into a powerful vampiric metaconcert when not leading their normal lives. After this, Dorothea realises that she is a latent metapsychic — one with inherent potential but mental blocks that prevent her using her powers, as opposed to the “operant” metapsychics. However, she starts to overcome her blocks and is able to use her mind to protect and heal herself. Meanwhile, Paul Remillard is preparing for Human entry into the Milieu and is in line to become the inaugural First Magnate of the Concillium. When his rival's wife is killed after being shoved into a trash compactor in an apparent suicide disguising her murder by Hydra, a hold is put on Human entry into the Milieu for 1,000 Galactic Days. The Krondaku investigators suspect the Remillards to be involved. Dorothea turns out to be another Paramount, with incredibly strong redactive powers and resistance to metapsychic probes and attacks. Young Marc Remillard is not able to probe her mind even when his powers are enhanced by the cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment that he has invented, although CE allows him to resist counterprobes. She even manages to slip into Denis's mind, but he quickly throws her out before she can find out much. Dorothea and Jack have a role in saving an inhabited planet from a diatreme eruption, using their paramount powers aided by CE. But her lower face is terribly deformed in this heroic act, so after this she always wears a diamond-studded half-mask, and acquires her nickname “Diamond Mask”. Magnificat. By the third book in the series, Marc has matured into a highly capable metapsychic and is regarded as a Paramount. Through manipulated dreams, Marc conceives an idea called 'Mental Man' which would create a new subspecies of Man called ""Homo summus"". It would use selective breeding, surgical modification, mental training (through induced pain) and technological enhancement to create hundreds of humans with the powers — and disembodiment — of Marc's younger brother Jack. This project has been kept highly secret for several years, but peers and competitors of Marc begin to get suspicious. He develops several increasingly powerful CE devices. These amplify a human's inherent metapsychic ability by orders of magnitude. The CE device is discussed in the debates of the Concilium, and is deemed too dangerous to be generally used. Marc disagrees, his research continues in secret although outlawed, and culminates in devices capable of 600x amplification. Marc's increasing ambition draws him to side with a rebel faction of the Concillium — those that do not wish to join 'Unity' with the other races and therefore with the Galactic Mind itself. The rebel faction determinedly opposes this as they believe humans will lose their individuality and privacy and will become thralls to the other races.  By this time, only two out of the original five Hydra units remain, Parnell Remillard and Madeleine Remillard — Marc's cousin and sister (it is revealed that the Hydra heads were the unborn children present at the vigil around Victor, where Fury corrupted their infant minds). One wet night, Anne Remillard — a staunch loyalist and advocate of Unity — visits Rogi's bookshop. She has deduced that Denis is Fury. Rogi doubts this but when Anne is attacked and nearly killed, he realises that he must inform Jack and Dorothea of the identity of Fury. The only opportune moment seems their upcoming wedding.  After Rogi divulges the information on Fury/Denis to Jack and Dorothea, the Remillard dynasty assembles in order to 'exorcise' Denis. Denis is tricked into making himself vulnerable, and they attempt to remove the Fury element of his psyche. This goes disastrously wrong, and Denis/Fury vanishes. He is later realised to have ""D-Jumped"" — teleported — a first for man and most aliens, although it is revealed in the Saga of the Pliocene Exile that the Shipspouses of Lene had this ability.  Marc, previously totally chaste, falls madly in love with Cyndia Muldowney, the daughter of Rory, an opponent of Paul's, and the two marry. After several events, Denis manages to briefly gain control from his Fury persona, and communicates with Cyndia. He reveals that the Mental Man babies (which were created from Marc and Madeleine's sperm and eggs) have become hundreds of Hydra by Madeleine's influence. Denis D-Jumps inside the complex and destroys all the children. Marc is dumbstruck, yet finds a way to terminate the Hydra-infested project while retaining the possibility of a new start. He mind-lasers Madeleine, aided by the CE, and has her frozen so that her ovaries may be used.  Denis travels to Mt. Washington, where he has manipulated Rogi using metapsychic coercion to journey to the summit. Bad weather hits the mountain and Rogi is shepherded into a shack by his nephew. Denis persuades Rogi to kill him with his yogic technique, as he fears Fury will regain control. None of his children could manage that even though they have strong metapsychic powers, because children seem to have a block against using their powers to attack their parents. And as Denis regards Rogi as a father figure, he hopes that Fury cannot use his powers against Rogi. Rogi feebly manages to start the technique but cannot muster the power. However, Fury does regain control and tries to kill Rogi physically, since the mental block against using metapsychic powers against parent figures does indeed apply. This act of violence gives Rogi the necessary desperation to trigger his operancy, and he vaporises Denis, to his great grief.  Marc in the meantime, continues his quest for Mental Man, but realises that the Metapsychic rebellion is too near for Mental Man to be present to ensure victory. Cyndia discovers Marc's plans, is horrified, and decides to remove all available sources of the new Mental Man. She acquires a sonic apparatus that will render Marc sterile, and triggers it by a telepathic command. However, Marc detects this impulse, realises what the device has done, and kills Cyndia by reflex. He mourns more because of his sterility than the loss of the wife he once loved greatly. Paul, father of Jack and Marc, is the leader of the Pro-Unity camp, and Jack decides to campaign against the rebels. As tension builds and several children start to co-adunate, the rebels' long-laid plans move into action. Marc has equipped hundreds of individuals with his CE devices, and his colleagues arm many ships. The rebels decide to demonstrate their power by destroying a planet — Molakar: the Krondaku planet from which the intervention was staged. Billions die in several seconds as the joined minds of the Rebels superheat the crust of the planet. A massive wave of metapsychic suffering and grief overwhelms the minds of the entire milieu. The response is not what Marc expects. Jack, Dorothea and his father, Paul, decide to confront him peacefully and will not let him take war to the galaxy. Marc decides to fight regardless, but the three pacifists call out to all the metapsychics in the galaxy to help join in Unity and stop the Rebels. One of Marc's main allies is Patricia Castellane, the leader of the cosmopolitan planet Okanagon. During the attack, the rebels accidentally lose control of another explosive device and it explodes, setting off Okanagon's unstable crust. The resultant geological catastrophe kills the entire population of two billion people. Jack telepathically asks his once-idolized brother, ""What have you done?!"" Jack and Dorothea manage to halt the rebel fleet, thanks to their ability to conjoin the powers of all the pro-Milieu operant humans. But these two and Paul die as a result. Many of the Rebels are also killed when their CEs overload, and Marc and a number of the leaders are badly hurt. The deaths of the people of Okanagon, however, propel humanity into the state of mental co-ordination (called ""coadunation"") which is the precursor to a benevolent joining of minds across the galaxy which the member races of the Milieu refer to as Unity. After the rebel faction is defeated, their leaders flee through a unique one-directional gate in France 6 million years back in time, to the Pliocene period. They were aided by a Lylmik who was powerful enough even to freeze Marc in his tracks, as he had done many years previously when Marc was a boy. There they stay in exile, and the events of the Saga of Pliocene Exile take place. Marc Remillard survives all those years (thanks to his ""immortality gene"", a trait shared by most members of the Remillard clan in differing degrees) and eventually evolves to the 3rd stage of mental evolution, where he brings purpose to the Lylmik to create the milieu. He thoroughly repents of his great evil, and becomes the enlightened leader of the same galactic society that starts the intervention, calling himself Atoning Unifex. Marc is evidently the Lylmik who appeared to his past self, and turns out to be the incorporeal ""Family Ghost"" who appears to Rogi for several years, driving him to finish his memoirs as a unique document of the Metapsychic rebellion. Marc, according to the family tree, passes on to the next stage of existence / evolution leaving Rogi to be healed and back in a relationship with Elaine. Some of the Lylmik have human bodies now as well and the future of what happens next is, as yet, unknown. "
wikipedia-3926881," Slab allocation  Slab allocation is a memory management mechanism intended for the efficient memory allocation of kernel objects which displays the desirable property of eliminating fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. Slab allocation was first introduced in the Solaris 2.4 kernel by Jeff Bonwick and now is widely used by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD and Linux (where it was the default allocator until 2.6.23 when SLUB allocation became the default). Basis. The primary motivation for slab allocation is that the initialization and destruction of kernel data objects can actually outweigh the cost of allocating memory for them. As object creation and deletion are widely employed by the kernel, mitigating overhead costs of initialization can result in significant performance gains. The notion of object caching was therefore introduced in order to avoid the invocation of functions used to initialize object state. With slab allocation, memory chunks suitable to fit data objects of certain type or size are preallocated. The slab allocator keeps track of these chunks, known as caches, so that when a request to allocate memory for a data object of a certain type is received it can instantly satisfy the request with an already allocated slot. Destruction of the object, however, does not free up the memory, but only opens a slot which is put in the list of free slots by the slab allocator. The next call to allocate memory of the same size will return the now unused memory slot. This process eliminates the need to search for suitable memory space and greatly alleviates memory fragmentation. In this context a slab is one or more contiguous pages in the memory containing pre-allocated memory chunks. Implementation. Understanding the slab allocation algorithm requires defining and explaining some terms: When a program sets up a cache, it allocates a number of objects to the slabs associated with that cache. This number depends on the size of the associated slabs. Slabs may exist in one of the following states : Initially, the system marks each slab as ""empty"". When the process calls for a new kernel object, the system tries to find a free location for that object on a partial slab in a cache for that type of object. If no such location exists, the system allocates a new slab from contiguous physical pages and assigns it to a cache. The new object gets allocated from this slab, and its location becomes marked as ""partial"". The allocation takes place quickly, because the system builds the objects in advance and readily allocates them from a slab. Slabs. A slab is the amount that a cache can grow or shrink by. It represents one memory allocation to the cache from the machine, and whose size is customarily a multiple of the page size. A slab must contain a list of free buffers (or bufctls), as well as a list of the bufctls that have been allocated (in the case of a large slab size).  Large slabs. These are for caches that store objects that are not less than 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. The reason for the large slabs having a different layout from the small slabs is that it allows large slabs to pack better into page-size units, which helps with fragmentation. The slab contains a list of bufctls, which are simply controllers for each buffer that can be allocated (a buffer is the memory that the user of a slab allocator would use). Small slabs. The small slabs contain objects that are less than 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. These small slabs need to be optimized further from the logical layout, by avoiding using bufctls (which would be just as large as the data itself and cause memory usage to be much greater). A small slab is exactly one page, and has a defined structure that allows bufctls to be avoided. The last part of the page contains the 'slab header', which is the information needed to retain the slab. Starting at the first address of that page, there are as many buffers as can be allocated without running into the slab header at the end of the page. Instead of using bufctls, we use the buffers themselves to retain the free list links. This allows the small slab's bufctl to be bypassed.  "
wikipedia-3926894," Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs  The Under Secretary for Political Affairs is the third ranking position in the United States Department of State, after the Secretary and the Deputy Secretaries. While the positions of Secretary and Deputy Secretary are occupied by political appointees, the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs is usually (but not always) occupied by a career Foreign Service Officer, making the occupant the highest-ranking member of the Foreign Service. The current Under Secretary is Wendy Sherman. The Under Secretary serves as the day-to-day manager of overall regional and bilateral policy issues, and oversees the bureaus for Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, the Near East, South Asia, the Western Hemisphere, International Organizations, and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. The Under Secretary is advised by Assistant Secretaries of the geographic bureaus, who guide U.S. diplomatic missions within their regional jurisdiction.  The political bureaus were first overseen in 1949 by a Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Prior to the creation of the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs assisted the Secretary and Under Secretary of State in the formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy. After August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs served as a focal point for interdepartmental relations, especially those dealing with politico-military issues. During 1969, the Department discontinued the position and created a new Bureau for Politico-Military Affairs, which exists today as the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs under another Under Secretary. Wendy R. Sherman was appointed to this post by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 21, 2011. "
wikipedia-3926896," Chest injury  A chest injury is any form of physical injury to the chest including the heart and lungs. Chest injuries account for 25% of all deaths from traumatic injury. Typically chest injuries are caused by blunt mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions or penetrating mechanisms such as stabbings. Classification. Chest injuries can be classified as blunt or penetrating. Blunt and penetrating injuries have different pathophysiologies and clinical courses.  Specific types of injuries include: Diagnosis. Most blunt injuries are managed with relatively simple interventions like tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and chest tube insertion. Diagnosis of blunt injuries may be more difficult and require additional investigations such as CT scanning. Penetrating injuries often require surgery, and complex investigations are usually not needed to come to a diagnosis. Patients with penetrating trauma may deteriorate rapidly, but may also recover much faster than patients with blunt injury. "

wikipedia-3938336," Golden Corral  Golden Corral is an American family-style restaurant chain serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, and featuring a large buffet and grill offering numerous hot and cold dishes, a carving station and their Brass Bell Bakery. It is a privately held company headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, with locations in forty states. History. In 1971, James Maynard and William F. Carl Gavone Siamese conceived the idea that became Golden Corral after several unsuccessful attempts to acquire a franchise with other companies. Golden Corral was incorporated in 1972 and the first Golden Corral Family Steak House opened on January 3, 1973, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The company has since expanded to over 480 locations across the United States; about 100 of them are company-owned. The others are franchised stores. Gross sales are over $1.53 billion. The company had more than 500 restaurants by 1987. That year, they decided to begin franchising by licensing 55 distressed restaurants to their most successful general managers. Because of poor training, nationwide concerns about the consumption of red meat, and a shift in market shares to upscale restaurants, sales were falling. The company added salad bars to all of its location, sacrificed seating in most, and in others sacrificed part of the parking lot to make additions to the buildings. In 1991, the first seven ""Metro Market"" concept restaurants opened. They were and seated between 400 and 450 customers. These new Golden Corral restaurants more than doubled the size of the old, which were typically with a capacity of 175 people. There was the addition of the Brass Bell Bakery, named for the brass bell which rang every fifteen minutes to signal that fresh bread, rolls, and pastries were coming out of the oven. An expanded buffet, dubbed the Golden Choice Buffet, was also added, which had a new layout to showcase its items. The location of these new restaurants, the majority of which were in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and North Carolina, was also a change for the company, moving away from small towns and into metropolitan areas. In 2001, system-wide annual sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time. As of 2008, there were 485 restaurants in 41 states. In April 2009, Golden Corral entered New England with a restaurant in Springfield, Massachusetts. The company's most recent restaurant concept, called ""Strata"", was rolled out during the mid-2000s in an effort to bring more of the food preparation into view of the guests. In all locations, guests serve themselves, including requesting made-to-order items such as Belgian waffles, omelets and char-broiled steaks. Many locations offer a ""To-Go"" service, which allows customers to pack anything they want into a ""To-Go"" container and then pay for it by the pound. Many restaurants also offer reserved parking. Controversy. Salmonella outbreak. In 2003, an outbreak of salmonella was linked to a Golden Corral restaurant in Kennesaw, Georgia. Twenty-three people were affected by the outbreak. The salmonella bacteria was found in a floor drain, leading health inspectors to believe that it had been washed off of equipment earlier. No original source was found. A similar outbreak occurred in Wyoming and Orlando, Florida, in late 2012. Norovirus outbreak. In 2012, an outbreak of norovirus was linked to a Golden Corral restaurant in Casper, Wyoming. Over 344 illnesses, with 282 primary cases, were reported by the Wyoming state epidemiologist. The virus got a push from 31 sickened food handlers at the restaurant who mostly kept working their normal shifts. Allegations of improper food storage. On July 1st, 2013 a YouTube video was uploaded alleging that during a health inspection, the Port Orange, Florida location was improperly storing prepared and raw food next to their dumpster. Items included, among other things: pot roast, gravy, hamburger patties, and raw baby back ribs. These items were still on their prep trays and bins, as well as on a speed rack. The employee in the video alleges that this is a common practice for the restaurant, and insinuated that the food was to be served later that day. On July 8, 2013, Golden Corral posted a response on YouTube, saying that the food was never served to the customers, the employee in the video was trying to make money off of the video, and the manager of the location has been fired. Philanthropy. Between 2001 and 2007, in support of the Veterans Day holiday, Golden Corral served more than 2.5 million free meals to active duty and retired military personnel, and has raised more than US$4.1 million for disabled veterans through its Military Appreciation Monday. The company also sponsors Children's Miracle Network with each store donating money to local children's hospitals. Internet domain. In January 2002, the National Arbitration Forum ordered that the domain ""www.goldencorralrest.com"" be transferred to Golden Corral from an unapproved domain service based in Russia. Racing sponsorship. From 2004 to 2006 the restaurant sponsored the Golden Corral 500, a NASCAR Sprint Cup spring race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and was the main sponsor for the 2009 season of ""WindTunnel with Dave Despain"" on Speed Channel. Golden Corral also sponsored the No. 28 Yates Racing Ford of Travis Kvapil during select NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events in the 2009 season. Dave Blaney was to use Golden Corral as one of his sponsors for the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. In 2011, Golden Corral sponsored two drivers for the Daytona 500. Dave Blaney earned primary sponsorship for his Tommy Baldwin Racing entry. Brian Keselowski received associate sponsorship after his surprise finish in the qualifying races. If a Golden Corral-sponsored driver finishes in the top ten, the chain honors a ""Kids Eat Free"" promotion. Dave Blaney finished third at the 2011 fall Talladega race. J.J. Yeley finished tenth at the 2013 Daytona 500, a promotion Golden Corral honors after the remaining races where the chain is the primary sponsor of the No. 36 Tommy Baldwin Racing entry. "
wikipedia-3938339," Short People  ""Short People"" is a song by Randy Newman from his 1977 album ""Little Criminals"". The verses and chorus are lyrically constructed as a pointed attack on the short. The bridge (sung by Glenn Frey), in contrast, states ""short people are just the same as you and I."" Newman interprets the song to be about ""prejudice"", as was widely thought, but added that it was ""about a lunatic"". As with many of his songs, such as ""Rednecks"", Newman wrote the song from the point of view of a biased narrator. Like Dire Straits' 1985 hit single ""Money for Nothing"" which used the same lyrical technique, the song was misunderstood by many listeners, who wrongly assumed that it reflected the performer's personal viewpoint.  Newman would later grow to dislike the song and its success, eventually calling it a ""bad break"", a ""novelty record like The Chipmunks"", and said it caused him to receive several threats regarding its misinterpreted message. However, it ended up being included in almost every one of his greatest hits albums. Although Newman had never charted a single before, and his previous album ""Good Old Boys"" had been his first to reach the Billboard Top 150, ""Short People"" soon gained attention as a novelty song. The song consequently became a major hit on radio, staying at number two on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and being only kept from reaching number one by Player's ""Baby Come Back"" and the Bee Gees's ""Stayin' Alive"". It follows a basic musical formula, with bass and drums centering on Newman's catchy pop piano line in the key of A. A small brass section and an electric guitar occasionally rise into the mix. In 1978, legislation was introduced in the state of Maryland to make it illegal to play ""Short People"" on the radio. Contrary to popular myth, the bill did not obtain enough votes to pass. Appearances in popular culture. The song was performed by actor James Coco on a 1978 episode of ""The Muppet Show"". A ""MADtv"" sketch parodying Newman's songwriting abilities also made references to the song. The Side Street Ramblers performed a version of this song. The song choice highlighted the height difference between the lead and bass singers: 5' and 6'5"" respectively.  In the film ""Semi-Pro"", Will Ferrell sings the song on the bus. It is also featured in the 1994 feature-length adaptation of ""The Little Rascals"", ""The Chipmunks Go to the Movies"" episode ""Funny We Shrunk the Adults"" as performed by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and in the ""Ally McBeal"" episode ""Boy to the World"". This song is heard on a ""Toy Story"" sing-along cassette tape (Newman composed the score to the film). The song is mistakenly mentioned as one of Michael Scott's favorite Bruce Springsteen songs in US version of the ""The Office"" episode ""Crime Aid,"" however, it is comically implied the character of Michael Scott does not realize this is not a Bruce Springsteen song. In 2009, the song was parodied by conservative political satirist Paul Shanklin as ""Old People"" with Shanklin doing a voice impersonation of American President Barack Obama on the health care reform debate in the United States. Andrew Hansen, an Australian satirical comedian, also performed this song on the comedy show Good News Week. Initially in the show he disclaimed the lyrics stating that he didn't hate short people—it was Randy Newman's lyrics (a reference to a skit he earlier participated in that questioned the legitimacy of charities for sick children and caused him, and his group The Chaser, to be temporarily suspended from television). Later in the show he performed the song again with his own lyrics referring to Adolf Hitler, Centrelink and popular television personalities including the show's host Paul McDermott. ""The Cleveland Show"" featured the song in the episode ""A Short Story and a Tall Tale"". The song was used in a good-humored, self-referential manner by Thomas Quasthoff, the great classical and jazz singer marked with heavy birth defects. The song appears in an episode of The Simpsons in its 22nd season. A sample of this song also appears on the diss track ""Say My Name"" featuring Eminem and Xzibit referring to Jermaine Dupree. "
wikipedia-3938438," EL84  The EL84 is a thermionic valve of the power pentode type. It has a 9 pin Noval base and is used mainly in the power output stages of audio amplification circuits, most commonly now in guitar amplifiers, but originally in radios and many other devices of the pre-transistor era. The EL84 is comparable electrically to the octal 6V6, widely used in the USA until the 1960s. An interchangeable North American type is the ""6BQ5"".  It was developed to eliminate the need for a driver tube in radios, and has rather more gain than is usual in a power pentode, producing full output from a relatively small drive signal. This eliminated the need for a preamplifier triode in radios, making them cheaper to produce. As the EL84 itself is a 9 pin Noval, it was also cheap to produce and manufacturers were quick to adopt it in general use, and they are found in many old European valve radios and other audio equipment. A single EL84 was used in low-cost equipment, and a push-pull pair for lower distortion and higher power. In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the Mullard-Philips tube designation, it has a heater voltage of 6.3V. It is capable, when used at its plate rating of 300 volts maximum, of producing 17 watts output in Class AB1 in push-pull configuration. Many guitar amplifiers routinely run EL84 tubes in excess of 400VDC, with the Traynor Guitarmate reportedly putting out 25w RMS with 2 EL84's in a push pull configuration and a B+ between 400-420VDC. Developed by Philips in 1953 for use in the British Mullard 5-10 amplifier, the EL84 came to prominence when used in Watkins (and later the Vox) amplifiers preferred by many British invasion bands of the 1960s. When overdriven, the EL84 power tubes in these amplifiers produce a distinctive chiming, articulate, treble-heavy sound when compared to 6L6 tubes more commonly used in American amplifiers of the era such as those from Fender. Other equivalent tubes are the 7189, an extended-ratings version of the tube for industrial applications, E84L (7320) long life, professional version with more than 10000 hours expected lifetime and the directly equivalent 6P14P (Cyrillic: 6П14П) produced in the USSR by the Reflektor plant. a slightly modified version of the 6P14P was manufactured in Russia for Sovtek. An extended-ratings version of the 6P14P is also available - 6P14P-EV (Cyrillic: 6П14П-ЕВ) and is known among US guitar players as ""EL84M"" or the ""Russian military EL84"".

wikipedia-3938470," History of public international law  The history of public international law examines the evolution and development of public international law in both state practice and conceptual understanding. Modern international law developed out of Renaissance Europe and is strongly entwined with the development of western political organisation at that time. The development of European notions of sovereignty and nation states would necessitate the development of methods for interstate relations and standards of behaviour, and these would lay the foundations of what would become international law. However, while the origins of the modern system of international law can be traced back 400 years, the development of the concepts and practises that would underpin that system can be traced back to ancient historical politics and relationships thousands of years old. Important concepts are derived from the practice between Greek city-states and the Roman law concept of ius gentium (which regulated contacts between Roman citizens and non-Roman people). These principles were not universal however. In East Asia, political theory was based not on the equality of states, but rather the cosmological supremacy of the Emperor of China. Early history. Basic concepts of international law such as treaties can be traced back thousands of years. Early examples of treaties include around 2100BC an agreement between the rulers of the city-states of Lagash and Umma in Mesopotamia, inscribed on a stone block, setting a proscribed boundary between their two states. Around 1000BC, an agreement was signed between Ramses II of Egypt and the king of the Hittites establishing ""eternal peace and brotherhood"" between their two nations: dealing with respect for each other’s territory and establishing a form of defensive alliance. The ancient Greeks before Alexander the Great formed many small states that constantly interacted. In peace and in war, an inter-state culture evolved that prescribed certain rules for how these states would interact. These rules did not apply to interactions with non-Greek states, but among themselves the Greek inter-state community resembled in some respects the modern international community. The Roman Empire did not develop an international law, as it acted without regard to any external rules in its dealings with those territories that were not already part of the empire. The Romans did, however, form municipal laws governing the interactions between private Roman citizens and foreigners. These laws, called the ""jus gentium"" (as opposed to the ""jus civile"" governing interactions between citizens) codified some ideas of basic fairness, and attributed some rules to an objective, independent ""natural law."" These ""jus gentium"" ideas of fairness and natural law have survived and are reflected in modern international law. Nation-states. After the fall of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire into independent cities, principalities, kingdoms and nations, for the first time there was a real need for rules of conduct between a large international community. Without an empire or a dominant religious leadership to moderate and direct international dealings, most of Europe looked to Justinian's code of law from the Roman Empire, and the canon law of the Catholic Church for inspiration. International trade was the real catalyst for the development of objective rules of behavior between states. Without a code of conduct, there was little to guarantee trade or protect the merchants of one state from the actions of another. Economic self-interest drove the evolution of common international trade rules, and most importantly the rules and customs of maritime law. As international trade, exploration and warfare became more involved and complex, the need for common international customs and practices became even more important. The Hanseatic League of the more than 150 entities in what is now Germany developed many useful international customs, which facilitated trade and communication among other things. The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals. Treaties—agreements between governments intended to be binding—became a useful tool to protect commerce. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War, meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities. Hugo Grotius. International practices, customs, rules and treaties proliferated to the point of complexity. Several scholars sought to compile them all into organized treatises. The most important of these was Hugo Grotius, whose treatise ""De Jure Belli Ac Pacis Libri Tres"" is considered the starting point for modern international law. Before Hugo Grotius, most European thinkers treated law as something independent of mankind, with its own existence. Some laws were invented by men, but ultimately they reflected the essential natural law. Grotius was no different, except in one important respect: Unlike the earlier thinkers, who believed that the natural law was imposed by a deity, Grotius believed that the natural law came from an essential universal reason, common to all men. This rationalist perspective enabled Grotius to posit several rational principles underlying law. Law was not imposed from above, but rather derived from principles. Foundation principles included the axioms that promises must be kept, and that harming another requires restitution. These two principles have served as the basis for much of subsequent international law. Apart from natural-law principles, Grotius also dealt with international custom, or voluntary law. Grotius emphasized the importance of actual practices, customs and treaties—what ""is"" done—as opposed to normative rules of what ""ought to be"" done. This positivist approach to international law strengthened over time. As nations became the predominant form of state in Europe, and their man-made laws became more important than religious doctrines and philosophies, the law of what ""is"" similarly became more important than the law of what ""ought to be."" Treaty of Westphalia. The Westphalian treaties of 1648 were a turning point in establishing the principle of state sovereignty as a cornerstone of the international order. However the first attempts at formulating autonomous theories of international law occurred before this, in Spain, in the 16th century. Most prominent among the early theorizers were the Roman Catholic theologians Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Suárez. Suárez is especially notable in this regard in that he distinguished between ius inter gentes and ius intra gentes which he derived from ius gentium (the rights of peoples). Ius inter gentes corresponds to modern international law. In 1625, Hugo Grotius followed with the first systematic treatise on international law, ""de iure belli ac pacis"", which dealt with the laws of war and peace. One important aspect of Grotius's treatment of international law is that he no longer bases it exclusively upon natural law, but also accepts that states among themselves can also create binding rules of law (ius voluntarium).  Still, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea of natural law as a basis for international law remained influential, and were further expressed in the works of Samuel von Pufendorf and Christian Wolff. Yet, in the second half of the 18th century, a shift occurs towards positivism in international law. In addition, the idea of international law as a means for maintaining international peace is challenged due to the increasing tensions between the European great powers (France, Prussia, Great-Britain, Russia and Austria). This tension between legal norms and political imperatives is well reflected in the century's most important treatise on international law, Emer de Vattel's ""Du Droit des Gens"" (1758). At the end of the century, Immanuel Kant believes that international law as a law that can justify war does not serve the purpose of peace anymore, and therefore argues in ""Perpetual Peace"" (""Zum Ewigen Frieden"", 1795) and the ""Metaphysics of Morals"" (""Metaphysik der Sitten"", 1797) for creating a new kind of international law.  After World War I, an attempt was made to establish such a new international law of peace, of which the League of Nations was considered to be one of the cornerstones, but this attempt failed unfortunately. The Charter of the United Nations (1945) in fact reflects the fact that the traditional notion of state sovereignty remains the key concept in the law of nations.  In the historiography of international law, some German authors, most notably among them Wilhelm Grewe and Karl-Heinz Ziegler, have argued that several periods can be distinguished, such as the Spanish era (1494–1648), the French era (1648-1789/1815), the English era (1789/1815-1919) and the American era since 1919. The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645–48), the treaties of Ryswick and Utrecht (1697/1714), Vienna (1814–15), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945). The League of Nations. Following World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions. The League of Nations, established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used ""external aggression"" to invade or conquer other member states. An international court was established, the Permanent Court of International Justice, to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war. Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences. International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs. Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it. The postwar era. After World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re-attempted through another treaty organization, the United Nations. The postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law. International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal. Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter. Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war. International law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war. Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like. Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned. The rules are rarely disputed. But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated. This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights. Modern customary international law. An important development in modern international law is the concept of ""consent."" Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule. Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty. An evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law. Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the ""opinio juris"" of what states believe international law requires them to do. Customary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it. At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions. As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them. When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it. Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting. Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage. Customary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty. For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations. Modern treaty law. Treaties are essentially contracts between countries. They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound. If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept. So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously. Modern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties. The first step is signing the treaty. Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement. The second step is ratifying the treaty. A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it. This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion. A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it. Each country ratifies treaties its own way. The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree. In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound. Modern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it. The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith. This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking. It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding ""preamble."" In the modern world, international law is more important than ever. Even the most powerful countries rely on it, and seek to comply with it—and suffer consequences if they ignore it. "

wikipedia-3938542," A Date with Elvis  A Date with Elvis is the eighth album by Elvis Presley, issued on RCA Victor Records (LPM 2011) in July 1959. It is a compilation of previously unreleased material from an August 1956 recording session at 20th Century Fox Stage One, two from Radio Recorders in Hollywood, and multiple sessions at Sun Studio. The album reached #32 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. It is currently out of print. Content. After Presley's induction into the army on March 24, 1958, RCA and his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, were faced with the prospect of keeping his name before the public for two years with no possibility of live performances, no movies, and with few unissued marketable recordings in the vault. A recording session was arranged for two days in June, which yielded enough items for five more single sides, singles being the commercial focus for rock and roll in the 1950s. Four of those tracks would be issued on 45s in 1958 and 1959 during his absence while doing military service. Presley, however, also did well in the albums market, all but one of his previous seven LPs charting no lower than #3, and RCA wished to continue promoting albums by Presley given his sales record. Much of Presley's material had not been released on LP, and for this album RCA collected material previously unavailable on album. Like its predecessor ""For LP Fans Only"", this album featured tracks that had been issued on Sun Records with limited release, and were almost impossible to locate beyond certain parts of the south. The remaining five tracks derived from three different EPs issued in 1956 and 1957. Even by the standards of the late 1950s and early 1960s, where long-playing albums often ran to only about 35 minutes, this was a very short album at twenty-three minutes, and as such became the lowest charting Presley LP of the decade. RCA would squeeze one more album in 1959 out of previously issued material, the second singles collection, but it too would be a lower seller by previous standard. Presley would return from overseas in 1960 to commence proper recording again. this album also folds out to be a calendar for the year 1960. A different version of the album, duplicating six tracks from the American release, but expanding the track list to a healthy fourteen, was issued in Australia on vinyl in September 1959. RCA issued the original 10 track album on compact disc in 1989. Audiophile CD recordings are available on import in the United States, including the version from Japan in 2005. "

wikipedia-3938749," Aeroflot Flight 593  Aeroflot Flight 593 was a Moscow–Hong Kong passenger service operated by ""AeroflotRussian International Airlines"" flown with an Airbus A310-300 that crashed into a hillside of the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, on 23 March 1994. There were no survivors. No evidence of technical malfunction was found. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders revealed the presence of the pilot's daughter and son on the flight deck. The children apparently had unknowingly disabled the A310 autopilot's control of the aircraft's ailerons while seated at the controls. The aircraft had then rolled into a steep bank and near-vertical dive from which the pilots were unable to regain control. Unlike Soviet planes, with which the crew had been familiar, no audible alarm accompanied the autopilot's partial disconnection, and consequently the crew remained unaware of what was happening. Aircraft. The aircraft involved in the accident was a leased Airbus A310-304, registration , msn 596, that was delivered new to Aeroflot on 11 December 1992. Powered with two General Electric CF6-80C2A2 engines, the airframe had its maiden flight as on 11 September 1991, and was one of five operating for ""Russian Airlines"", an autonomous division of ""AeroflotRussian International Airlines"" that was set up for serving routes to the Russian Far East and Southeast Asia. On average, the crew of three operating the aircraft had logged 900 hours on the type. Description of the accident. The jet was en route from Sheremetyevo International Airport to Hong Kong Kai Tak International Airport with 75 occupants aboard, of whom 63 were passengers. Most of the passengers were businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan who were looking for economic opportunities in Russia. The relief pilot, Yaroslav Kudrinsky (), was taking his two children on their first international flight, and they were brought to the cockpit while he was on duty. Aeroflot allowed families of pilots to travel at a discounted rate once per year. Five people were in the cockpit: Kudrinsky, copilot Igor Peskaryov, Kudrinsky's son Eldar (), his daughter Yana, and another co-pilot that the official investigation report identified as V. E. Makarov. With the autopilot active, Kudrinsky, against regulations, let them sit at the controls. First his daughter Yana took the pilot's left front seat. Kudrinsky adjusted the autopilot's heading to give her the impression that she was turning the plane, though she actually had no control of the aircraft. Shortly thereafter Eldar occupied the pilot's seat. Unlike his sister, Eldar applied enough force to the control column to contradict the autopilot for 30 seconds. This caused the flight computer to switch the plane's ailerons to manual control while maintaining control over the other flight systems. A silent indicator light came on to alert the pilots to this partial disengagement. However, the pilots, who had previously flown Russian-designed planes which had audible warning signals, apparently failed to notice it. The first to notice a problem was Eldar, who observed that the plane was banking right. Shortly after, the flight path indicator changed to show the new flight path of the aircraft as it turned. Since the turn was continuous, the resulting predicted flight path drawn on screen was a 180 degree turn. This indication is similar to the indications shown when in a holding pattern, where a 180 degree turn is intentional to remain in one place. This confused the pilots for nine seconds. During this confusion, the plane banked past a 45-degree angle (steeper than it was designed for). This increased the g-force on the pilots and crew, making it impossible for them to regain control. After the plane banked to 90 degrees, the remaining functions of the autopilot tried to correct its plummeting altitude by putting the plane in an almost vertical ascent, nearly stalling the plane. The co-pilot and Eldar managed to get the plane into a nosedive, which reduced the g-forces and enabled the captain to take the controls. Though he and his co-pilot did regain control and level out the wings, their altitude by then was too low to recover, and the plane crashed at high vertical speed, estimated at . All aboard were killed.  The aircraft crashed gear up, and all passengers had been prepared for an emergency, as they were strapped into their seats. No distress calls were made prior to the crash. Despite the struggles of both pilots to save the aircraft, it was later concluded that if they had just let go of the control column, the autopilot would have automatically taken action to prevent stalling, thus avoiding the accident. The wreckage was located on a remote hillside approximately east of Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia; the flight data recorders were found on the second day of searching. Families of western victims placed flowers on the crash site, while families of Chinese victims scattered pieces of paper with messages written on them around the crash site. The airline originally denied that children were in the cockpit. The Moscow-based magazine ""Obozrevatel"" (Обозреватель ""Observer"") published the transcript on the week of Wednesday, 28 September 1994. The ""Associated Press"" said that, according to the transcript, ""the Russian crew almost succeeded in saving the plane"". ""The New York Times"" said that ""A transcript of the tape printed in the magazine Obozrevatel shows that the Russian crew nearly managed to save the Airbus plane and the 75 people on board, but that it was hampered by the presence of children and its unfamiliarity with the foreign-made plane.""

wikipedia-3938775," Push–pull converter  A push–pull converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter that uses a transformer to change the voltage of a DC power supply. The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push–pull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications. Circuit operation. The term ""push–pull"" is sometimes used to generally refer to any converter with bidirectional excitation of the transformer. For example, in a full-bridge converter, the switches (connected as an H-bridge) alternate the voltage across the supply side of the transformer, causing the transformer to function as it would for AC power and produce a voltage on its output side.  However, ""push–pull"" more commonly refers to a two-switch topology with a split primary winding. In any case, the output is then rectified and sent to the load. Capacitors are often included at the output to buffer against the inevitable switching noise. In practice, it is necessary to allow a small interval between powering the transformer one way and powering it the other: the “switches” are usually pairs of transistors (or similar devices), and were the two transistors in the pair to switch simultaneously there would be a risk of shorting out the power supply. Hence, a small wait is needed to avoid this problem. This wait time is called ""Dead Time"" and is necessary to avoid transistor shoot-through. Transistors. N-type and P-type power transistors can be used. Power MOSFETs are often chosen for this role due to their high current switching capability and their inherently low ON resistance. The gates or bases of the power transistors are tied via a resistor to one of the supply voltages. A P-type transistor is used to pull up the N-type power transistor gate (common source) and an N-type transistor is used to pull down the P-type power transistor gate. Alternatively, all power transistors can be N-type, which offer around three times the gain of their P-type equivalents. In this alternative the N-type transistor used in place of the P-type has to be driven in this way: The voltage is amplified by one P-type transistor and one N-type transistor in common base configuration to rail-to-rail amplitude. Then the power transistor is driven in common drain configuration to amplify the current. In high frequency applications both transistors are driven with common source. The operation of the circuit means that both transistors are actually pushing, and the pulling is done by a low pass filter (coil) in general, and by a center tap of the transformer in the converter application. But because the transistors push in an alternating fashion, the device is called a push-pull converter. Timing. If both transistors are in their on state, a short circuit results. On the other hand if both transistors are in their off state, high voltage peaks appear due to back EMF. If the driver for the transistors is powerful and fast enough, the back EMF has no time to charge the capacity of the windings and of the body-diode of the MOSFETs to high voltages. If a microcontroller is used, it can be used to measure the peak voltage and digitally adjust the timing for the transistors, so that the peak only just appears. This is especially useful when the transistors are starting from cold with no peaks, and are in their boot phase. The cycle starts with no voltage and no current. Then one transistor turns on, a constant voltage is applied to the primary, current increases linearly, and a constant voltage is induced in the secondary. After some time T the transistor is turned off, the parasitic capacities of the transistors and the transformer and the inductance of the transformer form an LC circuit which swings to the opposite polarity. Then the other transistor turns on. For the same time T charge flows back into the storage capacitor, then changes the direction automatically, and for another time T the charge flows in the transformer. Then again the first transistor turns on until the current is stopped. Then the cycle is finished, another cycle can start anytime later. The S-shaped current is needed to improve over the simpler converters and deal efficiently with remanence. "

A right-handed batsman and a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he plays first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Patel made his One Day International debut for England in August 2008, however was later dropped from the side after failing to meet fitness levels. After an absence of 2 and a half years, he returned to the ODI side in 2011 and made his Twenty20 International debut, before becoming the 651st player to represent England at Test cricket by winning his first cap on the tour of Sri Lanka. Early and personal life. Samit Patel was born in Leicester on 30 November 1984, to Rohit and Sejal. His parents originated in India where he has relatives. Patel's brother Akhil (b. 1990) has also played for Nottinghamshire, making his debut in 2009. Patel was educated at Eastwood Comprehensive School but later studied at Worksop College in north Nottinghamshire where he was a member of the 1st XI cricket team for five seasons. Whilst at the College, Patel represented England at under 15, under-17 and under-19 levels. He helped them record wins over such schools as Repton, Manchester Grammar School and Shrewsbury School and such clubs as the MCC. Career. Since making his début for Nottinghamshire at the age of 16, Patel has featured consistently in the team, in both first class and List A matches. He became the only man in the history of the English Twenty20 competition to claim a double-wicket-maiden, when Nottinghamshire played Derbyshire at New Road, Worcester in 2006. He scored 887 runs in the County Championship in 2007 including four centuries – he also took 10 wickets and topped the county's bowling averages. In the 2008 season, Patel made a steady start to Nottinghamshire's first-class campaign, scoring a century against Durham and three half-centuries. International breakthrough. Patel made his debut for England's senior one-day team in a match against Scotland on 18 August 2008. His first wicket was that of Neil McCallum and he finished with figures of 1/22 from seven overs; he also took a catch and ran out the Scotland captain, Ryan Watson. Patel remained part of England's ODI team for the series against South Africa later that summer, taking the notable wicket of Herschelle Gibbs in the first ODI of the series at Headingley. He recorded figures of 5/41 and scored 31 runs off 49 balls in the third ODI to win the man of the match award as England claimed the series. In September 2008, it was announced that Patel and six other players – the group was mostly made up of ODI specialists – would be given incremental contracts with the England Cricket Board (ECB). Having been previously included in England's ODI and T20 squads for the tour of the West Indies in March and April 2009, Patel was dropped over fitness concerns. Hugh Morris, the director of English cricket, stated that ""Samit Patel is a talented cricketer but he, like every other player who joins the senior England team, must be aware of the strict fitness criteria that will be set. It is extremely frustrating that Samit has not heeded the warnings of his county, Nottinghamshire, and Geoff Miller selector as well as the England management and strength and conditioning team. In the circumstances we had no option but to de select him from the tour ... his fitness levels have regressed between his first assessment during the build up to the England Lions tour and the second Test during the first week in New Zealand."" Despite the setback, in April 2009 Patel was selected for England's 25-man performance squad. Having worked to improve his fitness, Patel said ""I have had to accept some difficult truths ... I don't want to be in a position again where I miss out on selection because of a lack of fitness"". Initially included in the 30-man preliminary squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Patel failed to make the final 15-man squad because of ongoing fitness problems. Geoff Miller commented ""I'm disappointed for us and for him, but we've laid down the rules and players have to abide by them. He feels he's been putting the work and time in, but he cannot explain it – the figures are there"". Nottinghamshire were runners-up to Durham in the 2009 County Championship; from 15 matches Patel scored 712 runs (the 4th most for the club that year) at an average of 30.95, with a highest score of 95. He also took 32 wickets at an average of 47.84, with two five wicket hauls. In January 2010, Patel signed a three-year deal with Nottinghamshire. He part funded a journey to the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy in Australia where he spent February and March, part of which was aimed at improving his fitness. When Nottinghamshire won the County Championship in 2010, Patel contributed fewer runs: 641 from 16 matches at an average of 26.70, making him the club's 6th highest run-scorer in the year's competition. His solitary century in the competition, an innings of 104 from 185 balls, came in a defeat to Somerset in July. On England's fringes. In September 2009, a year after he was granted an incremental contract with the ECB, Patel's England contract was not renewed for 2009–2010. He remained on the fringes of selection, however his level of fitness prevented his selection. In January 2010, Miller stated that ""He knows what is required ... the ball is in his court now and he has to go away and understand what is necessary"". When England's provisional 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup was announced in December that year, Patel was included. England coach Andy Flower had commented that Patel's style of play would be well suited to the pitches in the Indian subcontinent, which was hosting the tournament, however persistent fitness problems meant he was not selected in the final squad of 15 and not called up when the squad sustained injuries. Patel was recalled to the England squad in June 2011 to face Sri Lanka in a T20I and five ODIs. Miller explained that Patel had been selected due to ""excellent form and plenty of hard work"". He made his Twenty20 International debut on 25 June against Sri Lanka; Patel was run out without scoring and bowled two wicketless overs as England succumbed to a nine-wicket defeat. For the fifth and final match of the ODI series, Patel returned to play his first ODI since November 2008. He scored eight runs and took 1/49. When England beat India 5–0 in the September ODI series, Patel played three matches. He took a solitary wicket and scored nine runs from a single innings. In October, England toured India for five ODIs and a T20I. Though England lost the series 5–0, Patel scored 160 runs and took four wickets at an average of 45.50. During the third ODI Patel scored his maiden half-century, 70 from 43 balls, beating his previous highest score in the format of 42. Patel had been in the preliminary list for the player auction ahead of the 2012 Indian Premier League but opted to withdraw to concentrate on English domestic cricket as participating would have meant missing up to seven County Championship matches. The new year began with Patel's inclusion in the England Lions squad to tour Sri Lanka in late January and early February 2012 for a one-day series. Patel played in all five matches and scored 128 runs with a highest score of 50, and was the leading wicket-taker on either side in the series with 12 wickets. When the ODI squad to face Pakistan was announced in February Patel was included. During the series, which England won 4–0, Patel was given an incremental contract by the ECB. England had suffered a 3–0 defeats in the Tests against Pakistan and when they toured Sri Lanka in March, struggling batsman Eoin Morgan was dropped and Patel was selected in the Test squad for the first time. Patel played in both Tests against Sri Lanka, batting at number 7 each time and making scores of 2, 9, and 29 and was dismissed each time by a spin bowler. He bowled 59 overs, taking 3/122. Patel began the English season in April with a run of low scores, amassing 33 runs from his first four innings. "
wikipedia-3939022," Wild World  ""Wild World"" is a song written and recorded by English singer-songwriter Cat Stevens. It first appeared on his fourth album, ""Tea for the Tillerman"", recorded and released in 1970 and, continuing the change in Stevens' sound, after leaving Deram Records and signing with Island Records. ""Mona Bone Jakon"" was his first album released after a debilitating year of recovery from tuberculosis. As he convalesced, Stevens filled his time whilst still on bedrest, finding himself becoming a far more prolific songwriter, and after such a dramatic brush with death began to focus on his purpose in life after some unpleasant and stressful dealings with his previous record label. Favouring a newfound ""stripped down"" folk rock sound and bucking the heavily orchestrated constraints from his previous contract with Deram Records' Mike Hurst, he instead chose Paul Samwell-Smith (formerly of The Yardbirds) as his producer. With Samwell-Smith supportive of his judgement, Stevens once again began turning out hit records with a different meaning and depth, both lyrically and melodically, beginning with ""Mona Bone Jakon"" and continuing to ""Tea for the Tillerman"", where ""Wild World"" became a popular hit song both in the United Kingdom and the United States. Both critics and Stevens himself agree that this album and the songs to come from it are some of Stevens' best work. Song meaning. Stevens developed a relationship with a young American woman, Patti D'Arbanville, and the two were a pair throughout a period of two years or so. During that time, he wrote several songs about her, including the hit song ""Wild World.""  The song is in the form of the singer's words to his departing lover, inspired by the end of their romance. Stevens later recalled to ""Mojo"": ""It was one of those chord sequences that's very common in Spanish music. I turned it around and came up with that theme- which is a recurring theme in my work- which is to do with leaving, the sadness of leaving, and the anticipation of what lies beyond."" Released as a single in late 1970, it just missed becoming Stevens' first top ten hit in the U.S., peaking at #11 on the ""Billboard Pop Singles"" chart. ""Wild World"" has been credited as the song that gave Stevens next album, ""Tea for the Tillerman"" ""enough kick"" to get it played on FM radio; and Island Records' Chris Blackwell has been quoted as calling it ""the best album we’ve ever released"" to that date. In November 2008, the Tea for the Tillerman CD was re-issued in a deluxe version which included the original demo of Wild World. Cover versions. The song has been covered by many artists, with many of the covers becoming hits of their own. Jimmy Cliff's version, released a few months after Stevens released the original version, reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. Surprisingly, Stevens' version was not released as a single in the UK. Some of the subsequent covers have also been in the reggae style, indicating that they may be covers of Cliff's version, as opposed to direct covers of Cat Stevens' original arrangement. An example of this would be Maxi Priest's version of the song. Recorded and released as a single in 1988, this version also did well on the charts, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart and #25 on the US Billboard Pop Singles Chart. In 1993, the band Mr. Big released a cover of the song as a single, charting at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100, #33 on the Top 40 Mainstream #33 and #12 on the Mainstream Top 40. In 1970, Australian band Fourth House released a cover version of ""Wild World"" as their one and only single. It reached #16 on the Australian charts. In 1971 Barry Manilow recorded Could It Be Magic, which features the same refrain melodically and lyrically (""Baby, I love you"").  In 1987, Jonathan King accused Pet Shop Boys of plagiarising the melody of ""Wild World"" for their UK #1 single ""It's a Sin"". He made the claims in ""The Sun"", for which he wrote a regular column during the 1980s. King also released his own cover version of ""Wild World"" as a single, using a similar musical arrangement to ""It's a Sin"", in an effort to demonstrate his claims. This single flopped, while Pet Shop Boys sued King, eventually winning out-of-court damages, which they donated to charity. In 2000, Brazilian pop group Pepê & Neném recorded a version of the song in Portuguese, ""Nada me faz esquecer"" (Nothing makes me forget). In 2006, ""Littlest Things,"" the third single released by Lily Allen from her debut album, ""Alright, Still"", was noted as having similarities with Wild World in its introduction. On July 7, 2007, the song was performed twice at the Live Earth concerts. James Blunt sang it at Wembley Stadium in London, England, while Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens) himself sang it in Hamburg, Germany. "

wikipedia-3939498," Rakhine people  The Arakanese (, Rakhine pronunciation ; ; formerly Arakanese), is a nationality in Myanmar forming the majority along the coastal region of present day Rakhine State. They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total population but no accurate census figures exist. Arakanese people also live in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong and Barisal Divisions. A group of Arakanese descendants, living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are known as the Marma people. These Arakanese descendants have been living in that area since the Arakanese kingdom's control of the Chittagong region. Arakanese descendants spread as far north as Tripura state in India, where their presence dates back to the ascent of the Arakanese kingdom when Tripura was ruled by Arakanese kings. In northeast India, these Arakanese people are referred to as the Mog, while in Bengali, the Marma (the ethnic Arakanese descendants in Bangladesh) and other Arakanese people are referred to as the Magh people. Etymology. According to the Rakhine Chronicles, the name ""Rakhine"" or ""Rakhine"" was originated from Pali word ""Rakhapura"" meaning the land of the people of Rakshasa (Rakshasa > Rakha > Rakhine) who were titled this name in honour of preservation on their national heritage (""a myo"") and or morality (""sila""). The word Rakhine means ""one who maintains his own race."" Nevertheless, the Arakanese have over the centuries been called many things by different visitors and their neighbours, including ""Burmese"" during the colonial period. Culture. The Arakanese are predominantly Theravada Buddhists and are one of the four main Buddhist ethnic groups of Myanmar (the others being the Bamar, Shan and Mon). They claim to be one of the first groups to become followers of the Buddha in Southeast Asia. The Arakanese culture is similar to the dominant Burmese culture but with more Indian influence, likely due to its geographical isolation from the Burmese mainland divided by the Rakhine Roma and closer proximity to South Asia. Traces of Indian influence remain in many aspects of Arakanese culture, including its literature, music, and cuisine. Language. The Arakanese language is a divergent form of Burmese. It is still generally mutually intelligible with standard Burmese, however, Arakanese retains the /r/ sound, which is now a /j/ sound in Burmese. Modern Arakanese script, aside from few vocabulary differences, is essentially the same as standard Burmese script. (The northern Brahmi-based Rakhawunna script found in stone inscriptions in the Vesali (Wethali) era is no longer in use.) History. The people of Rakhine claim a history that began in 3325 BC and archaeological evidence has been found for the beginning of the 1st century AD at the excavations at Dhanyawadi. According to the chronicles, the first independent Rakhine kingdom was established in 3325 BC by King Marayu. The name of the kingdom “Dhanyawadi” means ""the land blessed with abundant grain."" Buddhism was introduced into Rakhine during the lifetime of the Buddha himself. According to Rakhine chronicles, Buddha in his lifetime visited the city of Dhanyawadi. In 554 BC, the Rakhine King Sandar Surya (Moon Sun) requested Buddha to leave an image of Himself. After casting the Great Image Mahamuni, (Great Sage) Buddha breathed upon it which resembled the exact likeness of the Blessed One. Dhanyawadi. Ancient Dhanyawadi lies west of the mountain ridge between the Kaladan and Le-mro rivers. Its city walls were made of brick, and form an irregular circle with a perimeter of about 9.6 km, enclosing an area of about 4.42 square km. Beyond the walls, the remains of a wide moat, now silted over and covered by paddy fields, are still visible in places. The remains of brick fortifications can be seen along the hilly ridge which provided protection from the west. Within the city, a similar wall and moat enclose the palace site, which has an area of 0.26 square km, and another wall surrounds the palace itself. From aerial photographs we can discern Dhanyawad I's irrigation channels and storage tanks, centered at the palace site. Mrauk-U. Mrauk-U, the last kingdom of independent Arakan founded by King Mong Saw Mon in 1430, has become the principle seat of Buddhism, has reaching at zenith of the golden age. Mrauk-U was divided into three periods: the earliest period (1430–1530), the middle period (1531–1638), and the last period (1638–1784). In Arakan antiquities at the Mrauk-U seems to give rational evidence as to where Buddhism was settled down. The golden days of Mrauk U city, those of 16th and 17th centuries, were contemporary to the days of Tudor kings, the Moghuls, the Ayuthiya kings and Ava (Inwa), Taungoo and Hanthawaddy kings of Myanmar. Mrauk U was cosmopolitan city, fortified by a 30-kilometer long fortification and an intricate net of moats and canals. At the centre of the city was the Royal Place, looming high over the surrounding area like an Asian Acropolis. Waterways formed by canals and creeks earned the fame of distinct resemblance to Venice. Mrauk U offers some of the richest archaeological sites in South-East Asia. These include stone inscriptions, Buddha images, the Buddha's foot-prints and the great pagoda itself which, stripped its later-constructed top, would be of the same design as the Gupta style of ancient India. In the city of golden Mrauk-U there are scattering innumerable temples and pagodas which preserved as places, thereby exerting a great influence on spiritual life of the people. Historical artifacts. The 243 Rakhine kings ruled Arakan for a long period of 5108 years. The oldest artefact, stone image of Fat Monk inscribed ""Saccakaparibajaka Jina"" in Brahmi inscription comes to the date of first century AD. An ancient stone inscription in Nagari character was discovered by renowned Archaeologist Dr. Forchhammer. Known as Salagiri, this hill was where the great teacher came to Rakhine some two thousand five hundred years ago. Somewhere from eastern part of this hill, a stone image in Dhamma-cakra-mudra now kept in Mrauk-U museum, was found earlier in 1923. This relief sculpture found on the Salagiri Hill represents Buddha preaching King Chandra Suriya belongs to 4th century AD; five more red sandstone slabs with the carving were found close by the south of this Salagiri Hill in 1986. They are the same type as the single slab found earlier in 1923. These carving slabs of Bhumispara-mudra, Kararuna-mudra, Dhammacakra-mudara, and Mmahaparinibbana-mudra represent the life of Buddha. These sculptures provide earliest evident about the advent of Buddhism into Rakhine; during the lifetime of the Buddha and these discoveries were therefore assumed as the figures of King Chandra Suriya of Dyanawadi, who dedicated the Great Maha Muni Image. These archaeological findings have been studied by eminent scholars and conclusion is that the Maha Muni was made during the king Sanda Suriya era. The founder of Vesali city, King Dvan Chandra carved Vesali Paragri Buddha-image in 327 A.D and set a dedicatory inscription in Pali verse That Buddha-image is carved out by a single block and the earliest image of Vesali. The meaning of Ye Dhamma verse is as follow. The verse, which is considered as the essence of Theravada spirit, bears testimony to the fact that Buddhism flourished to an utmost degree in Vesali. The relationship of Vesali with foreign countries especially Ceylon would be established for Buddhism. The stone inscriptions are of Sanskrit, Pali, Rakhine, Pyu languages. Anandachandra Inscriptions date back to 729 AD originally from Vesali now preserved at Shitethaung indicates adequate evidence for the earliest foundation of Buddhism. Dr. E. H. Johnston's analysis reveals a list of kings which he considered reliable beginning from Chandra dynasty. The western face inscription has 72 lines of text recorded in 51 verses describing the Anandachandra's ancestral rulers. Each face recorded the name and ruling period of each king who were believed to have ruled over the land before Anandachandra. Archaeology has shown that the establishment of so many stone pagodas and inscriptions which have been totally neglected for centuries in different part of Rakhine speak of popular favored by Buddhism. The cubic stone inscriptions record the peace making between the governor of Thandaway (Sandoway) Mong Khari (1433–1459) and Razadhiraj the Mon Emperor in Rakhine inscription. This was found from a garrison hill at the oldest site of Parein. A stone slab with the alleged figure of the Buddha preaching, King Chandra Suriya bore testimony to the Salagiri tradition, depicting of the advent of the Teacher to Dyanyawaddy. Convention of the Buddhist Council in Rakhine. The crowing event in the history of Rakhine was the Convention of the Buddhist Council at the top of golden hill of Vesali under the royal patronage of King Dhammawizaya in 638 AD through joint effort of two countries, Rakhine and Ceylon. This momentous triumph of the great council was participated by one thousand monks from Ceylon and one thousand monks from Rakhine kingdom. As a fitting celebration of the occasion, the lavish construction of pagodas, statues and monasteries were undertaken for the purpose of inscribing the Tripitaka. After Vesali, Pyinsa was found by Lemro dynasty in 818 AD; the great king of dynasty (AD 818-1430) was King Mim-Yin-Phru, who turned his attention towards the development of Buddhism, and in 847 AD he convened the second Buddhist council in Rakhine attended by 800 Arahants. Rakhine chronicles report that therein the Tripitaka and Atthakatha were inscribed on the golden plate and enshrined. Never has there been impediment in the practice of Theravada Buddhist faith since it has been introduced in Rakhine. The copious findings of inscription Ye Dhamma verse were practical evidence that Theravada was dominant faith if epigraphic and archaeological sources were to be believed. The Royal patronage has always been significant factor contribution to stability and progress of the religion in Rakhine. Architecture. Arakanese chronicle records that more than six million shrines and pagodas flourished in Mrauk-U. In fact, they formed the pride of golden Mrauk-U. Dr. Forchhammer in his book entitled ""Arakan"", ""in durability, architectural skill, and ornamentation the Mrauk-U temples far surpass those on the banks of Arrawaddy"". Buddhist arts both in the field of architecture and Buddha-image constructions are on the same line of flourishing. An illustrative example of this fact can be seen in the temple of Chitthaung pagoda and colossal Dukekanthein temple. Gold and silver coins serve as the priceless heritage of the Mrauk-U period. The tradition of coin-making was handed down from the Vesali kings who started minting coins around the fifth century. The coins so far found are of one denomination only. Inscribed on the coins are the title of the ruling king and his year of coronation; coins before 1638 had Rakhine inscriptions on one side and Persian and Nagari inscriptions on the other. The inclusion of the foreign inscriptions was meant for the easy acceptance by the neighboring countries and the Arab traders. Twenty-three types of silver coins and three types of gold coins have so far been found. All the kings who ascended the throne issued coins. City walls, gates, settlements, monastery sites, fortresses, garrisons and moats are the other priceless heritages left to the safe keeping of today's Rakhine people. Stone rubbles of proud mansions of that period are also priceless reminders of Rakhine glory. It is no wonder that Mrauk U is properly known as the ""Land of Pagodas"" and Europeans remarked Mrauk U as ""The Golden City"". The Rakhine of those days were proud of Mrauk U. They were entirely satisfied to be the inhabitants of Mrauk U. The history shows what happened in the city in early times. Foreign invasion. The country had been invaded several times, by the Mongols, Mon, Bamar and Portuguese and finally the Bamar in 1784 when the armies led by the Crown Prince, son of King Bodawpaya, of the Konbaung dynasty of Burma marched across the western Yoma and annexed Rakhine. The religious relics of the kingdom were stolen from Rakhine, most notably the Mahamuni Buddha image, and taken into central Burma where they remain today. The people of Rakhine resisted the conquest of the kingdom for decades after. Fighting with the Rakhine resistance, initially led by Nga Than Dè and finally by Chin Byan in border areas, created problems between British India and Burma. The year 1826 saw the defeat of the Bamar in the First Anglo-Burmese War and Rakhine was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Yandabo. Sittwe (Akyab) was then designated the new capital of Rakhine. In 1852, Rakhine was merged into Lower Burma as a territorial division. Independence movement. Rakhine was the center of multiple insurgencies which fought against British rule, notably led by the monks U Ottama and U Seinda. During the Second World War, Rakhine was given autonomy under the Japanese occupation and was even granted its own army known as the Arakan Defense Force. The Arakan Defense Force went over to the allies and turned against the Japanese in early 1945. In 1948, Rakhine became a division within the Union of Burma. Shortly after, violence broke out along religious lines between Buddhists and Muslims. Later there were calls for secession by the Arakanese, but such attempts were subdued. In 1974, the Ne Win government's new constitution granted Rakhine Division ""state"" status but the gesture was largely seen as meaningless since the military junta held all power in the country and in Rakhine. 2012 Rakhine State riots. The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya people and Arakanese in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. The riots came after weeks of sectarian disputes and have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict. The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Rohingyas by Arakanese as the main cause. Whole villages have been ""decimated"". Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Bingali Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June, 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced. According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between Arakanese Buddhists and Rohingyas, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed. It also displaced more than 52,000 Rohingya people. The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the regions. On June 10, state of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region. The Burmese army and police have been accused of targeting Bingali Muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence. A number of monks' organizations that played vital role in Burma's struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Bingali community. In July 2012, the Myanmar Government did not include the Rohingyas–-classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and therefore the government says that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.

In the film, he is a ""Brooklyn-loving"", sports-loving, die-hard New York Knicks fan. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, ""Mars Blackmon"" became the primary pitchman in Nike commercials for ""Air Jordans"", the basketball shoes worn by Michael Jordan. As of January 2011, Nike has resumed using the character for its Air Jordan ""Spiz'ike"" line of shoes. In the April 30, 2010 episode of the genealogy television show ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" that focused on Spike Lee's search for his mother's ancestors, Spike said that he had called his grandmother to ask for a name for the character. His grandmother had given him the name ""Mars"". In the episode, Spike's research finds that Mars was the name of his great-great-grandfather (his grandmother's grandfather). "
wikipedia-3939538," Doctor of Nursing Practice  The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) is a terminal professional degree that focuses on the clinical aspects of a disease process. The curriculum for the DNP degree generally includes advanced practice, diagnoses, and treatment of diseases. The DNP is intended to prepare a registered nurse to become an independent primary care provider. Furthermore, the DNP is intended to be a parity degree with other health care doctorates such as psychology, medicine, and dentistry. Primary practice roles in nursing include the nurse practitioner (NP), certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), certified nurse midwife (CNM), and the clinical nurse specialist (CNS). Although approximately 52% of nurse anesthetist programs will award the DNP, the remaining 48% may use the title Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP) for their terminal degree. Education requirements in the United States. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), transitioning advance practice registered nursing programs from the graduate level to the doctoral level is a ""...response to changes in health care delivery and emerging health care needs, additional knowledge or content areas have been identified by practicing nurses. In addition, the knowledge required to provide leadership in the discipline of nursing is so complex and rapidly changing that additional or doctoral level education is needed."" According to the AACN, ""...benefits of practice-focused doctoral programs include: Transitioning toward the doctorate. The AACN recommends that all entry-level nurse practitioner educational programs be transitioned from the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree to the DNP degree by the year 2015. The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists has followed suit, requiring the DNP (or DNAP-Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice) degree for entry-level nurse anesthetist programs by the year 2025. Nurse practitioners and nurse anesthetists currently practicing with either an MSN or certificate will not be required to obtain the DNP for continued practice. There are two terminal doctorate-level degrees in nursing: The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Previous doctorate level degrees have been, or are in the process of being, phased out and converted to one of the two terminal degrees. The Doctor of Nursing (ND, not to be confused with Naturopathic Doctor ""ND"") and the (DrNP) have transitioned into the DNP whereas the Doctor of Nursing Science (DNSc, DNS or DSN) has transitioned into the PhD. The PhD in nursing is generally considered the academic and research-oriented degree, whereas the DNP is the practice-oriented or professional terminal degree. Controversy in the United States. DNP and the use of the ""Doctor"" title. Currently there is a controversy over the title “Doctor” being used within the clinical setting by the DNP. Although MDs, DOs, and DNPs all nominally hold a doctorate degree by education, in a medical setting the term ""doctor"" has historically referred to Doctors of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), Podiatrists (DPM), Dentists (DDS or DMD), and Optometrists (OD) but not to Nurse Practitioners (NP) since they generally did not hold doctorate degrees. However, the DNP has evolved much like the other clinical doctorates, and, some argue, that the public uses the term ""doctor"" generically to describe that person who is a licensed professional and is in the primary decision making role for their care. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing and six other professional nursing organizations contend that the term ""doctor"" is an appropriate term to describe a Doctor of Nursing Practice. However, a 2008 survey revealed considerable confusion among Americans regarding the credentials and qualifications of many healthcare providers, and that an overwhelming majority favor all healthcare providers to clearly designate their skills, training, and level of education. These findings prompted the American Medical Association to launch the ""Truth in Advertising Campaign"" in 2011 to promote transparency in how all healthcare providers market themselves, stating, ""Patients deserve to know who is providing their care."" They further contend that ""Confusion among Americans about who is and who is not qualified to provide specific patient care undermines the reliability of the healthcare system and can put patients at risk."".  As of 2013, only a few states specifically prohibit DNP's from using the title ""Doctor"" with their patients (Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon), while four more states require them to clarify that they are not physicians (New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Virginia). Masters vs Doctorate. Although controversial, the adequacy of existing master's-level education is further supported by other articles that show that in resource poor areas with Medicaid clientele, nurse practitioners provide a level of care that is rated similar to that of physicians in comparable level. It is however, unclear whether patient rating of care correlates with equal outcomes. In contrast, the level of training between physicians board certified in an area of specialty and a DNP working as a primary care provider is not intended to be comparable. A physician will typically have 4 years of undergraduate education, 4 years of medical school, and 3 to 8 years in paid residency (e.g. family practice, internal medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, etc.). Physicians often continue by doing a subspecialty or fellowship (e.g. cardiology, nephrology, oncology, etc.). In contrast a typical DNP will have 4 years of undergraduate education, experience as a registered nurse, and 4 years of advanced practice education (e.g. women's health, pediatrics, anesthesia, etc.). Additionally, the prolonged education of physicians through specialty residencies has compounded primary care shortages in the United States and therefore the DNP offers a practical solution with its primary care emphasis and streamlined clinical focus. Nurse practitioner vs Physician Assistant. There is much controversy between the DNP and the Physician assistant, in that each have a similar scope of practice. The DNP in general has more autonomy as a health care provider. The greater autonomy for the DNP largely comes from education requirements and the governing bodies that influence each professions scope of practice. The PA scope of practice is largely determined by the American Medical Association, individual State, and physician delegation. While the DNP scope of practice is determined by the individual State Board of Nursing. However, the DNP has a licensing exam which is determined by the practicing state (commonly administered by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners). PA programs have transitioned to a master's level with an average length of 27 months. The nurse practitioner may complete a bachelors degree in nursing, practice as a nurse for at least one year, and then either completes the master's level NP in 2 years or the DNP in 3 years. However having a bachelors degree in nursing and practicing as a nurse before entry into the program are not required to become an NP; not all NPs have previous nursing experience. The requirements vary widely depending on the NP program. Overall, the scope of practice of a DNP and a PA vary from state to state and depend ""entirely"" on the law of the practitioner's state. Nurse practitioner vs physician. In the United States, patient choice between physicians and nurse practitioners has become a point of contention, especially as nurse practitioners gain greater autonomy. "

wikipedia-3939583," Kirk Bloodsworth  Kirk Noble Bloodsworth (born October 31, 1960) is the first American sentenced to death row who was exonerated by DNA, although his death sentence had already been commuted to two consecutive life sentences by the time his exoneration based upon DNA evidence was in the works.  Imprisonment. An honorably discharged former Marine and Maryland resident, Bloodsworth was convicted in 1985 of sexual assault, rape, and first-degree premeditated murder for the 1984 rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in Rosedale, Maryland. Even though five eyewitnesses had placed him with the victim, he continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent incarceration. In 1992, while in jail, Bloodsworth read an account of how DNA fingerprinting had led to the conviction of Colin Pitchfork in the killings of Dawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann; hoping to prove his innocence, he pushed to have the evidence against him tested by the then-novel method. Initially, the available evidence in the case — traces of semen in the victim's underwear — was thought to have been destroyed; however, when eventually located (in a paper bag in the judge's chambers), testing proved that the semen did not match Bloodsworth's DNA profile. In 1993, Bloodsworth was released; by that time, he had spent almost nine years in prison, two of them on death row. Though released from prison, Bloodsworth was not formally exonerated. In 2003, nearly a decade after Bloodsworth's release, prisoner DNA evidence added to state and federal databases identified the real killer, Kimberly Shay Ruffner. A month after the 1984 murder, Ruffner had been sentenced to 45 years for an unrelated burglary, attempted rape and assault with intent to murder, and had in fact been incarcerated in a cell one floor below Bloodsworth's own cell. In light of the new evidence, Ruffner was charged with the crime for which Bloodsworth had been wrongfully convicted, and in 2004 Ruffner pled guilty to the 1984 murder.  Life After Prison. While in prison, Bloodsworth converted to the Catholic Church from Protestantism. Today, Bloodsworth is a Program Officer for The Justice Project, and he has been an ardent supporter of the Innocence Protection Act (IPA) since its introduction in Congress in February 2000. The IPA established the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program, a program that will help states defray the costs of post-conviction DNA testing. Further reading.

wikipedia-3940091," HP-10C series  The HP-10C series calculators were introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1981. Also known as the ""Voyager"" series, all are programmable, use Reverse Polish Notation, and feature continuous memory. Nearly identical in appearance, each model provided different capabilities and was aimed at different user markets. The HP calculators 10C series consisted of five models (with original retail price and years of production): The HP-12C remains in widespread use today. HP-10C. The HP-10C is the last and lowest-featured calculator in this line, even though its number would suggest an earlier origin. The 10C was a basic scientific programmable. While a useful general purpose RPN calculator, the HP-11C offered twice as much for only a slight increase in price. Designed to be an introductory calculator, it was still costly compared to the competition, and many looking at an HP would just step up to the better HP-11C. Poor sales led to a very short market life making it one of the most difficult of the series to find today. HP-11C. The HP-11C is a mid-range scientific programmable calculator. HP-12C. The HP-12C is a popular financial calculator. It was such a successful model that Hewlett-Packard redesigned it from scratch, added several new functions, and introduced it as the HP-12C Platinum in 2003 and a limited 30th anniversary edition in 2011. The HP-12C is HP's longest and best-selling product, in continual production since its introduction in 1981. Due to its simple operation for key financial calculations, the calculator long ago became the de facto standard among financial professionals – for example, most investment banks issue HP-12Cs to the members of each incoming class of its investment banking analysts and associates. Its popularity has endured despite the fact that even a simple, but iterative, process such as amortizing the interest over the life of a loan—a calculation which modern spreadsheets can complete almost instantly—can take over a minute with the HP-12C. Later HP financial calculators are many times as fast with more functions, but none has been as successful. The HP-12C's programming mode is very intuitive and works like a macro operation on a computer. Basically, the keys one would press in the calculating mode to arrive at a solution are entered in the programming mode along with logical operators (""if"", ""and"", etc.) applicable to the solution. After the programming is complete, the macro will run in computation mode to save the user steps and improve accuracy. There are 99 lines of programmable memory on the HP-12C, and 400 lines on the HP-12C Platinum. The HP-12C Platinum is a revision to the successful 12C. The 12C Platinum is visibly distinguished by its silver-colored upper half as opposed to the gold-colored plate on the original 12C. The Platinum has a faster processor, larger memory and more built-in functions including the option of algebraic entry. In 2008 HP quietly supercharged the HP-12C with an Atmel AT91SAM7L128 microprocessor (based on an ARM 7TDMI 32-bitmicroprocessor core), running at 30MHz when executing code. The processor runs the HP-12C code in emulation mode delivering performance 50-150 times faster than the original, and 10-20 times faster than the Platinum version that continues to be available. HP-15C. The HP-15C is a high-end scientific programmable with a root-solver and numerical integration. It is able to handle complex numbers and matrix operations. Although out of production, its popularity has led to high prices of US$200–400 on the used market and a petition asking HP to restart production. The HP-15C was a replacement for the (LED Display based) HP-34C. On September 1, 2011, HP announced that a limited edition 15C based on the ARM hardware used in the modern 12C would be released. HP-15C Limited Edition. The HP-15C Limited Edition is a reproduction of the 15C based on the modern ARM powered 12C hardware, released at the same time as the 30th Anniversary Edition HP-12C. This model is powered by 2 CR2032 batteries, and can easily be differentiated from original production run (1982–89) 15Cs by the ""Limited Edition"" script below the HP 15C logo, and the black text on brushed metal back label, as opposed to the white text on black of the original. HP-16C. The HP-16C is a computer programmer's calculator, designed to assist in debugging. It can display numbers in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary, and convert numbers from one base to another. A number of specialized functions are provided to assist the programmer, including left- and right-shifting, masking, and bitwise logical operations. HP has (as of 2013) never made another programmer's calculator, but has incorporated the 16C's functions in later calculator models. Arithmetic. One of the least-known features of this calculator series is the quality of the arithmetic inside them. Hewlett-Packard retained the well-known numerical analyst Prof William Kahan, from UC Berkeley, the architect of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, to design the numerical algorithms implemented by the calculators. He also wrote parts of the manuals. Programming. The HP 10c series calculator are keystroke programmable, meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. These keystroke programs, in addition to performing any operation normally available on the keyboard, can also make use of conditional and unconditional branching and looping instructions, allowing programs to perform repetitive operations and make decisions. The available programming features differentiate between the various HP 10c series calculator systems. Clones: DM-1XC. The DM-1x series is a series of credit-card-sized calculators made by Swiss Micros (not affiliated with HP) running Voyager series firmware and looking like miniature versions of their HP equivalents. The series consists of DM-15, DM-16, DM-12, DM-11, DM-10. All calculators use the same hardware, but differ in keyboard and firmware (which can be changed with an upgrade port). These devices are essentially functional clones of the original HP models. "

wikipedia-3913007," History of Rangers F.C.  Rangers F.C., formed in 1872, are the first club in the world to win more than 50 league titles, currently 55. The club is also the most honoured in the world winning 116 trophies in total. Over its 141 years history, Rangers have only been managed by thirteen different men. This article tells the story of the club from its beginnings to the European Cup Winners Cup success, the 1902 and 1971 Ibrox disasters, the Nine in a Row league championship wins, and the collapse and insolvency following gross financial mismanagement. The history is divided into sections regarding the manager of the club rather than sections of major events. There are some overlaps between managers tenures, namely the Nine in a Row success which began with Graeme Souness and continued under Walter Smith. Formation and early years. In 1872, the club was formed by a group of rowing enthusiasts, Peter Campbell, William McBeath and brothers, Peter and Moses McNeil saw a group of men playing football on Glasgow Green's Flesher's Haugh. Indeed the team's first game was at Flesher's Haugh in May 1872 against Callander, which resulted in a 0–0 draw. Moses McNeil suggested the name Rangers after seeing the name in a book about English Rugby. Rangers only played two matches in their birth year and their second match, with the team donned in light blue shirts, was a comprehensive 11–0 win over a team named Clyde (not the present Clyde). Rangers began to grow into a more formal football club and in 1876, for the first time, a player was called up to play international football as Moses McNeil made his Scotland debut against Wales. In 1888 the now famous Old Firm fixture was born as Rangers met Celtic for the first time in a friendly match. Celtic beat Rangers 5–2 with a team composed largely of ""guest players"" from Hibernian. The 1890–91 season saw the inception of the Scottish Football League, and Rangers were one of ten original members. By this time Rangers were playing at the first Ibrox Stadium. Rangers' first ever league match took place on 16 August 1890 and resulted in a 5–2 victory over Heart of Midlothian. After finishing equal-top with Dumbarton a play-off was held at Cathkin Park to decide the who would be champions. The match finished 2–2 and the title was shared for the only time in its history, the first of Rangers' world record 54 championships. Rangers had to wait until 1894 to taste their first Scottish Cup success after losing to Vale of Leven in 1877 and 1879 but finally lifted the trophy for the first time after a 3–1 win over Celtic. Rangers even came close to winning the English FA Cup in 1887 when they lost to Aston Villa in the semi-final. Rangers ended the nineteenth century with further Scottish Cup wins 1897 and 1898 and a League Championship win in 1899 during which they won every one of their 18 league matches. Rangers formally became a limited company on 27 May 1899 and the then match secretary William Wilton was appointed as the clubs first manager. This also enabled Ibrox stadium to be constructed that same year. The club also appointed its first board of directors under the chairmanship of James Henderson. By the turn of the century Rangers had won two league titles and three Scottish Cups and were well on their way to becoming one of Scotland's top clubs. The Wilton years. Rangers were in the ascendancy at the turn of the century, winning the championship seven times between 1900 and 1918 (with four League title in a row). The season of 1898–99 was particularly memorable, in that it saw the Gers win all 18 league games to establish a perfect record. But between 1902 and 1910, Celtic took over as the dominant force, and though Rangers had the chance to foil a third League and Cup double in 1909, the Scottish FA withheld the Cup due to disgraceful scenes after a pitch invasion by drunken fans. The Hampden Riot had written itself a sorry page in the history books, and both clubs were ordered to compensate hosts Queen's Park for the damage caused by their so – called fans. Having lost the title in 1919 they responded in 1920 with one of the best seasons in their history as manager William Wilton and his right hand man Bill Struth retained the title netting 106 goals in 42 league games. However, in May 1920 the clubs first ever manager, William Wilton, died in a boating accident and Bill Struth was subsequently appointed manager. Struth's era. The key statistic of the 1930s was three consecutive Scottish Cup wins from 1934, 1935, 1936. History was there to be made in 1937 when they set out on the trail of a fourth win, only to lose in the First round to lowly Queen of the South. Ironically, this was the first Rangers game ever to be immortalised on film. The post-war seasons saw Rangers well on top, but not before a boardroom coup in the summer of 1947. The board of Rangers had previously been an amateur body made up of former players, but when chairman James Bowie suggested a 71-year-old Struth retire in order to allow a younger man to take charge, a revolution occurred. Bowie was forced out the chair and was said never to have set foot in Ibrox ever again such was his disdain for the circumstances of his departure. Struth went on to steer Rangers to 18 league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and 2 League Cups in his 34 year tenure as manager. He was also the first Rangers manager to win the domestic treble when it was achieved for the first time in Scottish football history in season 1948–49, the success based on the so-called Iron Curtain defence which remained virtually unchanged from 1946 to 1953. After Bill Struth collected two more domestic doubles in 1950 and 1953, Scot Symon was appointed as Rangers third manager on 15 June 1954. Under Symon. Symon continued Struth's success winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups. He also became the second manager to win the domestic treble in season 1963–64. Another purple patch began at the end of the 1950s: from 1957 until 1965. Rangers achieved four League titles, plus an equal number of wins in both League and FA Cups. This was the era of Slim Jim Baxter, a superb ballplayer who was by turns exhilarating and exasperating. But though Baxter was to depart for England in 1965, there was a player who had been a first – team regular for the past couple of seasons who would mature into an inspirational leader, a stalwart in the dark blue of Scotland and would eventually manage the club. John Greig was that man, and though Rangers would play out the decade in the shadow of their European Cup – winning neighbours, the foundations were being laid for future success. In season 1956–57 Symon took Rangers into the European Cup for the first time but it ended abruptly, going out on to French team Nice. The following season however saw Rangers suffer their worst ever defeat to their arch rivals Celtic, losing 7–1 in the League Cup final of 1957. They did however reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960 losing eventually to German club Eintracht Frankfurt by a record aggregate 12–4 for a Scottish team. In 1961 Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the Cup Winners' Cup final against Italian side Fiorentina, only to lose 4–1 on aggregate. Rangers suffered yet more despair in the final of the same competition in 1967, losing 1–0 after extra time to Bayern Munich. After these disappointments, the pressure was on Symon and he paid the penalty of Celtic's success in Scotland and Europe in October 1967, giving way to his former assistant Davie White after rejecting a move to make him general manager with White in charge of team affairs. White takes charge. David White was installed as Rangers' fourth manager on 1 November 1967. He had initially come to Rangers as assistant to manager Symon as part of a grooming process, giving him time to learn the ropes and take over when he was ready. However, it didn't turn out that way and the responsibility came too early. White was on his own and in charge after just five months at the club and aged just 34-years-old. When White took up the reins at Rangers, the team had failed to win the league championship in three seasons, the longest title drought in 50 years. He also happened to be up against one of the greatest ever Celtic managers, in Jock Stein, and teams, the 1967 European Cup Final side. White started incredibly well and went on to win 19 of his first 20 league matches in charge, amassing 39 out of a possible 40 points. The only blemish being a 2–2 draw at Celtic Park on 2 January, which happened to be the sides third game in only four days. The Scottish Cup gave White his first defeat as Rangers manager. A third round replay against Hearts on 13 March looked to be heading for extra time, when in the 87th minute, Donald Ford struck the winner for Hearts. Rangers were out the Cup. Incredibly, this was White's only loss in his first 30 domestic games in charge. A couple of draws in April, and White's first league defeat in the final minute of the final game of the season, 3–2 at home to Aberdeen, cost Rangers the title by two points. Despite accumulating the highest percentage of points won by any Rangers side since Bill Struth's first season and collecting 61 points, which would have won the title in 11 of the past 12 seasons, Rangers were beaten by Celtic. Their Old Firm rivals amassed 63 points and following the Ne'erday derby draw gone on to win all of their remaining league fixtures. In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign that season Rangers reached the quarter-finals, meeting Leeds United in March 1968. After a 0–0 draw at Ibrox, two goals in six minutes at Elland Road in the second leg were enough to see Leeds progress 2–0 aggregate. Leeds United went on to win the Fairs Cup. The 1968–69 season was to be White's one and only full season in charge at the club. He made two major signings at the start of the season. The first was when he broke the Scottish transfer record and outbid the English Champions Everton to buy Colin Stein from Hibernian for £100,000. Secondly he paid St. Johnstone £50,000 for Alex MacDonald. The league campaign till the end of November was inconsistent, 4 draws and 3 defeats from 13 matches, although the side did win the first Old Firm match 4–2 at Celtic Park. Rangers went on a run from December until April where they lost only once in all competitions, 3–2 away to Airdrieonians in the league. The seemed to be unstoppable, an example being one week in the middle of March (15th–22nd), when Rangers beat Clyde 6–0 at Ibrox in the league on the Saturday, with Stein scoring hat-trick before being sent-off, four days later the side beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 at home in the Fairs Cup then followed this three days later by hammering Aberdeen 6–1 in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Stein's disciplinary record caught up with him and he was suspended from the end of March until the end of the season. Without his goals the team dropped six points from the final six league games and conceded the title to Celtic by five points. The route to the 1969 Scottish Cup Final saw Rangers dispose of Hibernian, Hearts and Airdrieonians before meeting Aberdeen in the semi-final. In the final, with Stein suspended, White opted to play Alex Ferguson rather than Sandy Jardine, purely because of the aerial threat of Billy McNeill at corners. Ferguson was blamed for a goal that Rangers conceded only two minutes into the match in which he was designated to mark goalscorer McNeill. Two horrendous mistakes from Örjan Persson and Norrie Martin minutes before the interval, were both seized upon by the 20-year-old George Connolly, resulted in two goals to give Celtic a 3–0 lead at half-time. Rangers lost the game 0–4 and Ferguson was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side. The Fairs Cup proved fertile once again. Rangers went all the way to the semi-finals, defeating FK Vojvodina (2–1 on aggregate), Dundalk (9–1 on aggregate), DWS Amsterdam (4–1 on aggregate), Bilbao (4–3 on aggregate) before losing 0–2 to Newcastle United on aggregate. The tie was basically lost at Ibrox as Rangers were held to a 0–0 draw, despite numerous chances and yet another missed penalty from Andy Penman. Newcastle United went on to win the trophy. Having brought the legendary Jim Baxter back home at the start of the 1969–70 season, White's faith was repaid immediately when in his first game back at Ibrox, Baxter masterminded a famous 2–1 comeback victory over Celtic in the League Cup sectional round that had the crowd in raptures. In the Cup Winners Cup we beat Steau 2–0 at home, and held out in Bucharest for a 0–0 draw where White cleverly employed John Greig in a sweeper's role. In the second round, despite losing 1–3 away to Górnik Zabrze, confidence was still high that the Rangers could overcome them at Ibrox. He was promising to, ""attack, attack, attack!"" in order to progress. Baxter scored a stunning goal after 18 minutes, and it all looked to be going to plan as Rangers sustained pressure continued for the first hour, and then the game changed. Gornik started to play and scored three quite brilliant goals in the final half hour as they toyed with Rangers, looking as if they could score at will. Gornik were applauded off the park. The next day, 27 November 1969, White's assistant Willie Thornton took over as caretaker and the club began to look for a new manager. The lack of honours during White's reign at Ibrox, however, masks the fact that he did improve the team during a difficult period. Celtic, under Stein, were at the peak of their success and White, as Rangers' first track suit manager working on the pitch with the players every day, did not fail through any lack of tactical knowledge. In his two seasons in charge Rangers had finished 2 points and 5 points behind Celtic. White was replaced by Willie Waddell, the former Rangers legendary winger, who had also won the Championship as a manager in 1965 with Kilmarnock, before returning to journalism with the Daily Express, where he was heavily critical of Rangers, and White in particular, referring to him as 'the Boy David'. With Waddell in charge, the next three seasons saw Rangers finish 12, 15 and 16 points adrift of Celtic in the Championship – 2 points for a win back then. The team also failed to beat Celtic in 10 of the 11 games it played with Waddell at the helm. European success and national tragedy. William Waddell, a former player who had made himself a name both in journalism and as the manager of Kilmarnock's championship-winning side of 1964–65, was appointed as Rangers manager on 8 December the same year. In 1972 he guided Rangers to their first, and to date only, European triumph when they defeated Dynamo Moscow 3–2 in the Cup Winners' Cup final at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Due to a pitch invasion at the end of the match, the team were presented with the trophy in the dressing room. Following pressure exerted by the Spanish Government of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, UEFA banned Rangers from defending the cup. This was perceived by some as a disproportionate and politically motivated decision, as evidenced by Barcelona's decision to invite Rangers to participate in their pre-season Trofeo Joan Gamper tournament (named after the club's founder) in 1974, alongside the Basque team Athletic Club de Bilbao. The triumph in the European Cup Winners' Cup came less than two years after the 1971 Ibrox disaster, when 66 people died leaving the east terrace at staircase 13. Within weeks of their European success, Waddell moved to the general manager position and his coach Jock Wallace was appointed as manager. The reasons for the 51 year-old Waddell relinquishing the reins at Rangers were never fully explained but he probably saw the coaching of players as a younger mans job. He also became determined to complete the reconstruction of Ibrox Stadium. Waddell's spell can only be seen as a unique achievement. In just little over two years he had enforced discipline and order to the club. This in turn brought European success and broke the dominance of Celtic, if only in the League Cup. Waddell also oversaw the recovery after the second Ibrox disaster, helping the families of the victims and forging strong links with supports' clubs. Wallace becomes manager. Jock Wallace's managership of Rangers saw the club achieve a period of sustained success. His first season as manager, 1972–73 was the club's centenary year. After taking over the first-team managers position on 31 May 1972, Wallace set about reshaping the side. He moved on Colin Stein and Willie Johnston to Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion respectively, bringing in Quinton Young, Joe Mason and Tom Forsyth. After a stuttering start to the league campaign, three defeats and a draw from the first six matches, the sides fortunes greatly improved. From October to the end of the season Rangers suffered only one league defeat, at home to Hearts on 2 December 1972, and went on a run of sixteen wins. However this run was not enough to become league champions as the side finished second, one point behind Celtic. In the cup competitions, the Scottish Cup campaign was to culminate in a 3–2 win over Celtic. The final was attended by Princess Alexandra along with 122,714 other spectators. It was Rangers first Scottish Cup win in seven years. The League Cup run was ended in the semi-finals at the hands of Hibernian after a 1–0 defeat. This season also saw compete in the first ever European Super Cup. The side played the European Cup holders Ajax in January 1973. The Dutch side were the only continental opposition the side faced that season due to the club's European competition ban. In the end Ajax proved to strong and recorded a 6–3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1–3 at Ibrox and 3–2 in Amsterdam. In the summer of 1973 Rangers chairman John Lawerence retired and was replaced by vice-chairman Matt Taylor. A nine-year period of Celtic dominance in the league was ended in 1974–75 as Rangers captured what was to be the last championship of its kind. The new ten-team Scottish Premier Division saw Rangers crowned inaugural champions, as part of a triumphant domestic treble. A barren subsequent season in 1976–77. Wallace presided over the club's fourth domestic treble and second in three years in 1977–78. During the close season Rangers spent heavily in the transfer market, bringing in Davie Cooper from Clydebank for £100,000 and Gordon Smith from Kilmarnock for £65,000. They were joined at the club by Bobby Russell who arrived from Shettleston Juniors for free. Despite these expensive signings the side did not make the best start to the league campaign, losing the opening two matches to Aberdeen and Hibernian. Order was restored the following week with a 4–0 defeat of Partick Thistle. A resounding 3–2 win over Celtic in the first Old Firm match of the season set the tone of the season. Rangers had been 2–0 down at half-time but recovered to win the game after outclassing Jock Stein's side in the second 45 minutes. In March 1978, second placed Aberdeen won 3–0 at Ibrox to set up a tense title run in. Rangers dropped seven points from twenty-one but held on winning the final four fixtures and the league. The League Cup was won by defeating Celtic 2–1 after extra time. Goals from season new boys Davie Cooper and Gordon Smith completed the first leg of the treble. The 2–1 1978 Scottish Cup Final win over Aberdeen made Wallace the only Rangers' manager to win two domestic treble's. Surprisingly despite this unprecedented success Wallace resigned from his position on 23 May 1978. The reason for his departure was never revealed but it is widely believed that a breakdown in the working relationship between Wallace and general manager William Waddell was the cause. At a time when Ibrox Park was undergoing extensive redevelopment the transfer budget was to suffer. Waddell was suspected of vetoing many signings, Alan Hansen from Partick Thistle and David Narey from Dundee United among them, in favour of investing in the rebuilding project. The burst of success under Wallace in the mid-1970s saw Rangers once again established as Scotland's most successful club. When Wallace, suddenly and unexpectedly, announced his resignation, Rangers turned to another of the stalwarts of the great side of the mid-to-late 1970s, the captain John Greig. Greig: Captain to manager. After the departure of Wallace the board acted quickly to replace the void with club captain Greig being promoted to first-team manager. Greig took a phone call on the day of Wallace's resignation from general manager Waddell. Greig was playing golf with team-mate Sandy Jardine when Waddell called him to offer him the job. On 24 May 1978 Greig was confirmed as the seventh manager of Rangers. Greig's tenure began promisingly. The 1978–79 season could so easily have mirrored the previous. Despite a fixture pile-up which resulted from the club playing three league games in nearly three months, and some overly negative tactics from Greig, Rangers came close to winning a quadruple of trophies. Unfortunately it was not to be and the season ended with just the domestic cup double. Wallace's treble-winning team of the previous season performed ably in the European Cup. Rangers eliminated Juventus after defeating the Italians 2–1 on aggregate – the first time Rangers had ever recovered from a first-leg defeat to win a two-legged European tie. Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, the then UEFA Cup holders, were overcome in the next round (the club's first home defeat in European competition), before an injury-stricken Rangers side lost to Cologne at the quarter-final stage. The early season league form was terrible as the team failed to win any of the first six league matches but a run was put together. Things began to unravel, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind champions Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4–2 Old Firm defeat a Parkhead. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final over Hibernian required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3–2. The 1979 Scottish League Cup Final ended in a 2–1 win for Rangers over a strong Aberdeen with goals from Alex MacDonald and Colin Jackson. The following the season finished trophyless. Rangers finished an embarrassing fifth in the league, eleven points behind champions Aberdeen. The main cause for such a poor showing in the league was pointed at the teams away form, only ten points from eighteen matches. Aberdeen also knocked Rangers out of the Scottish League Cup over a two-legged third round tie. Rangers did reach the 1980 Scottish Cup Final only to lose out to Old Firm rivals Celtic, 1–0 thanks to a deflected George McCluskey shot in extra time. The European Cup Winner's Cup campaign was ended by the eventual winners Valencia CF after having seen off Lilliestrom and Fortuna Düsseldorf in previous rounds. The summer of 1980 saw Greig bring in Jim Bett from Lokeren for £150,000. Bett was joined by Colin McAdam a £165,000 signing from Partick Thistle. The side got off to a good start in the league, going on a fifteen match unbeaten run, including two Old Firm wins, was to end in November. A disastrous run in November and December all but ended the title challenge as the team finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup campaign was halted after a controversial defeat to Aberdeen in a match where the Dons were awarded two contentious penalties. Due to having no European participation, Rangers entered the Anglo-Scottish Cup which led to humiliation and embarrassment at the hands of English minnows, Chesterfield. The third division side held Rangers to a 1–1 draw at Ibrox before thumping Rangers 3–0 in the away leg at Saltergate. Rangers did win the 1981 Scottish Cup Final after beating Dundee United 4–1 in a final replay. After a tedious 0–0 draw where Ian Redford missed a last minute penalty, Rangers won the replay with goals from Davie Cooper, a John MacDonald double and Bobby Russell. Greig's fourth season in charge, 1981–82, ended yet again without the league championship. Rangers finished third, twelve points behind Old Firm rivals Celtic who were champions. There was an apparent lack of ambition at the club due a lack of transfer funds which were being directed towards the redevelopment of Ibrox Park. There was the surprise signing of Northern Ireland international John McClelland from Mansfield Town. The Ulsterman proved to be a shrewd acquisition and later became the club captain. European participation was halted by Dukla Prague who soundly beat the team 3–0 in Prague and a 2–1 second leg win for Rangers was not enough for the team to progress. The domestic cup competitions proveded successful ground as Rangers reached both finals. The team lost the 1982 Scottish Cup Final 4–1 to Aberdeen despite leading for the majority of the match. A late Aberdeen equaliser took the game into extra-time before the Dons added a trio. Rangers did win the 1982 Scottish League Cup Final by defeating Dundee United 2–1 with goals from Davie Cooper and Ian Redford. Greig made big-money signings in the pre-season 1982–83 with renewed hope that they could at least mount a serious title challenge, but once again, the season ended in trophyless failure. Dave MacKinnon – £30,000 from Partick Thistle, Craig Paterson – £200,000 from Hibernian, Robert Prytz from Malmö FF and Sandy Clark from West Ham United, were all welcomed to the club. The early signs were positive. Rangers reached the 1983 Scottish League Cup Final scoring en route 29 goals in their ten games and eliminated Borussia Dortmund from the UEFA Cup. The opening eight league games saw the side unbeaten but the final match saw Rangers lying in fourth, a massive eighteen points behind champions Dundee United. The team was knocked out of Europe after suffering a 5–0 defeat from Cologne. The 1983 Scottish Cup Final was lost to an Aberdeen side that had won the European Cup Winner's Cup ten days earlier. The 1983–84 season would signal the end of John Greig's managerial career. The league season began badly, one point from the first four league games, although the team did win their six League Cup games under Greig. A fruitful brief run in the European Cup Winner's Cup saw Rangers win the second round, first leg 2–1 over F.C. Porto after the team's record breaking 18–0 aggregate win over Maltese champions Valletta. After the first nine league games, Greig's team had collected just ten points from twenty-seven. In the end the pressure was to much and Greig resigned from his post on 28 October 1983. Greig's efforts to restructure the team inherited from Wallace proved, for the most part, fruitless. The early years of the 1980s were ones of repeated frustration as the club continually failed to mount a challenge not only to Celtic, but to the resurgent New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United. The gloom of under-performance in the league was punctuated only by periodic cup triumphs. The Scottish Cup win of 1981, in particular, saw a triumphant performance by the enigmatic winger, Davie Cooper. The League Cup proved fertile territory for Rangers throughout the fallow years of the early 1980s, but it was the failure to add to the league triumph of 1978 that saw the growing pressure on Greig culminate in his resignation as manager in October 1983. During this period attendances at Ibrox dwindled from an average 25,628 in season 1978–79 to 17,681 in 1982–83. Return of Wallace. Rangers hoped to rekindle success by bringing Jock Wallace back to the club, following his exile in England with Leicester City. Wallace, though, was not the club's first choice: Jim McLean and Alex Ferguson, the then managers of the New Firm clubs, both rebuffed Rangers' advances. McLean's brother Tommy was appointed caretaker manager and four games passed before a permanent manager was in position. On 10 November 1983, Jock Wallace was persuaded by the Rangers board to leave Motherwell and return to the club. His aim was to restore the glory years of the treble-winning sides of the late 1970s. Wallace's initial impact was positive, boosting morale and fitness. He made changes to the coaching staff, bringing in Alex Totten as first team coach with Tommy McLean, David Provan and Joe Mason leaving. Wallace also added to the squad during the season, Bobby Williamson arrived from Clydebank, Nicky Walker from old club Motherwell and Stuart Munro from Alloa Athletic. Wallace's first match in command was at Pittodrie on 12 November 1983. The game ended in a 3–0 defeat but the side went on a 22 match unbeaten run in all competitions until March 1984. Yet, Rangers still ended that season fourth in the league, fifteen points behind champions Aberdeen. The club did win a trophy, the 1984 Scottish League Cup. It was a thrilling extra time victory over Celtic, with Ally McCoist getting a hat-tick, in a 3–2 win that won them the cup. The 1984–85 season, Wallace's first full season in charge since his return, was almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. Rangers again finished fourth in the league but it was by a record twenty-one point margin behind champions Aberdeen. This disappointing performance was not caused due to a lack of investment in the playing squad. A total of £495,000 was spent bringing in Iain Ferguson and Cammy Fraser from Dundee, Ted McMinn from Queen of the South and bringing back Derek Johnstone from Chelsea. The club won the Scottish League Cup for the second season in a row defeating Dundee United in the final. A solitary Iain Ferguson strike gave Rangers a 1–0 win. A reasonable start was made to Wallace's second full season in charge. Five wins out of six matches in the league plus a further two wins in the League Cup. However, things quickly began to sour as a fall out between manager and then club captain, John McClelland saw the latter stripped of the captaincy. McClelland was soon sold to Watford in November 1985 for £265,000. The Ulsterman was missed and the team's form was to suffer. By the turn of the year Rangers were in third position in the league. From 1 January 1986, the side won only a quarter of the remaining sixteen league fixtures. With no hope of a trophy, after defeats in the Scottish Cup third round and the League Cup semi-final, things looked bleak for the club. So perhaps it came as no surprise that on 7 April 1986, Jock Wallace resigned as manager of the club. He was to jump before being pushed by the then newly appointed Rangers chairman David Holmes. Holmes had gone on record saying that the slump the club was in could not be allowed to go on. Wallace's side might have won the League Cup twice in a row, but the league form remained indifferent. The continuing dominance of the great Aberdeen side of the 1980s, coupled with strong Dundee United and Celtic teams that offered periodic challenges to Aberdeen's ascendancy, placed Wallace under increasing pressure. By the 1985–86 season Rangers had slipped to fifth place in the league and, with little evidence of improvement since the Greig era, it was inevitable that Wallace would be removed as manager. However, the search for Wallace's replacement was a brief one. The Souness Revolution. In April 1986, Graeme Souness was appointed as Rangers' first player-manager by chairman David Holmes. Souness had previously been playing in Italy with U.C. Sampdoria and made the move to Glasgow for a £300,000 fee. This was the first of many big money transfer deals to be made at Rangers. Although the first deal Souness was involved with was regarding his backroom staff. He brought in Walter Smith, from Dundee United as his assistant and ex-Coventry City manager Don Mackay as reserve-team coach. Souness' first flurry into the transfer market resulted in a £175,000 purchase, Colin West. The investment made in West was small compared to that made in other members of the playing staff. Souness took advantage of the European competition ban imposed by UEFA on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Due to this, plus a sizeable transfer kitty, he was able to attract the cream of English sides talent. The first of many international players arrived in the shape of Chris Woods, followed by the likes of England deputy captain Terry Butcher and former Manchester United defender Jimmy Nicholl. The 1986–87 season would be the first time in eight seasons that Rangers finished top of the Scottish Premier Division. But the season began eventfully with player-manager Souness being sent-off in the first league match of the season on 9 August 1986. A violent foul on Hibernian's George McCluskey meant Souness had to watch the 2–1 defeat from the stands. But forty-three matches; thirty-one wins, seven draws and five defeats later Rangers were the champions. The league crown was not Souness' first Rangers trophy however, a 2–1 win over Celtic gave them a 1986 Scottish League Cup Final win. He also won the Glasgow Cup thanks to an Ally McCoist hat-trick. That same season, goalkeeper Chris Woods set the then British football shut out record of 1196 minutes. From 26 November 1986, when he conceded a goal in a UEFA Cup 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, until 14 games later on 30 January 1987 when Adrian Sprott of Hamilton Academical knocked Rangers out of the Scottish Cup by a single goal. The following season Rangers could not build on the success of the previous. Despite the arrival's of Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins, Mark Walters, Mark Falco, John Brown and Richard Gough, who became Scotland's first £1 million player. The title defence began badly, three points from the first ten, that added with injuries and suspensions meant the club finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup Final victory was the only bright spark that season, although there was a decent run the European Cup with Dynamo Kiev and David White's foes Górnik Zabrze as scalps. A final against Aberdeen saw Rangers win 5–3 on penalties after drawing 3–3. The Scottish Cup ended in the fourth round at the hands of Dunfermline Athletic. Nine in a row. Rangers had previously won nine titles in a row before during the period directly before and following into the Second World War. However the league championships won during wartime are not officially recongised. Due to the depletion of the squads as players left to help with the war effort, the Scottish Football Association suspended legitimate competitions and set up regional league competitions in their place. Souness years. The 1988–89 season was to start what would be one of the most successful spells of Rangers history. When Souness' side regained the league championship by a margin of six points from second-placed Aberdeen, few could predict that would be the first of many. The club had again invested heavily in the playing staff. Again the club imported players from English sides with Gary Stevens joining from Everton and Kevin Drinkell from Norwich City. A pre-season spent in Italy was the perfect build-up to the new season. The team were unbeaten in all competitions in August and September, including a 5–1 mauling of Celtic at Ibrox. The initiative gained was never really lost and Rangers collected fifty-six points from thirty-six games, twenty-six of which were victories. The League Cup was again at Ibrox as the side again beat a determined Aberdeen team. The final came just a fortnight after the sides met in the league, Rangers lost 2–1 in the Granite City. During the game Aberdeen's Neil Simpson inflicted a terrible tackle on Rangers midfielder Ian Durrant which left the latter with a knee injury for over three years. But for a 1–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1989 Scottish Cup Final, the treble would have rested at Ibrox that season. The arrival of businessman David Murray in 1988 continued the Rangers' resurgence. Murray had acquired Rangers for £6 million from the club's then owner, the Nevada-based Lawrence Marlborough on 23 November 1988. History could have been very different however, had he not been rejected by home town club Ayr United. Murray officially became chairman on 2 June 1989, replacing David Holmes. Murray retained the ambitious strategy he had inherited from Holmes. This was demonstrated on 10 July 1989 when Rangers, acting on Souness' say so, purchased former Celtic striker Mo Johnston from French club Nantes for £1.5 million. The fact Rangers signed an ex-Celtic player would have been a big enough story but the fact Johnston was a high-profile Roman Catholic made the move unprecedented. The transfer angered both sides of the Old Firm's support, Rangers because Johnston was an ex-Celt and Catholic (Rangers, seen as the Protestant club in Glasgow and signing Catholics was a rare occurrence) and Celtic fans saw Johnston as a turncoat who had already committed to re-join Celtic from Nantes before Rangers made known their interest. When the season began, Rangers did not. Three matches played in the league, no wins and two defeats. However, the team slowly got into gear, despite only two wins from the first eight games. New arrival Johnston netted the crucial winner during an Old Firm game on 4 November 1989. Scoring the goal in the dying minutes of the match meant Johnston was all but forgiven by the Rangers support. Come May 1990, Rangers' name was on the trophy for the second time in as many seasons but the club again failed to win the Scottish Cup, losing to Celtic in the fourth round, and for once did not win the League Cup. The side lost to Aberdeen by 2–1 in the final. The 1990–91 season would be Souness's last season in charge. On 16 April 1991, the fiery Scot departed for his former club Liverpool before the league campaign reached its dramatic culmination, saying he had ""gone as far as he would be allowed to go"". A last-day victory over Aberdeen at Ibrox gave Rangers ""Three in a Row"". Souness assistant Walter Smith was in charge that day. Before his departure Souness had made sure to fall out with and sell on club captain Terry Butcher and spend big money on striker Mark Hateley, winger Pieter Huistra and forgotten man Oleg Kuznetsov. Sadly for Souness though he was never to win a Scottish Cup with Rangers as the team went down 2–0 to Celtic at Parkhead, for the second season in a row. The 1990 Scottish League Cup Final ended in another victory however. The Souness years were marked by both achievement and conflict. Under Souness's stewardship, Rangers' preeminence in the Scottish game was restored. At a time in which English clubs were excluded from European competition, the club also gained arguably a higher profile in the British game than at any time in its history. This was fuelled by the purchase of a succession of English internationals, including Ray Wilkins, Terry Butcher and Chris Woods. It was also fuelled by the controversial signing of Roman Catholic and former Celtic player Mo Johnston, who was persuaded to change his mind at the last minute and sign for Rangers rather than their bitter city rivals. Johnston's signing led to outrage from some fans of the traditionally Protestant club as he became the first high-profile Catholic to sign for Rangers in modern times. Despite his success, Souness was never part of the Scottish footballing establishment. His managership saw countless run-ins with the footballing authorities. He was sent off in his debut and suffered more than one touchline ban. Souness's departure met with mixed reactions amongst Rangers supporters. Many were disappointed, some bemoaned what they saw as his betrayal of the club, all however, were united in viewing the Souness revolution as amongst the most dramatic period in Rangers history. Smith's tenure. The ninth manager of Rangers was a man who had previously worked as assistant to the eighth, Walter Smith. He was appointed manager on 19 April 1991, a day before a crucial Scottish Premier Division match away to St. Mirren. Smith guided the side to a 1–0 win and followed that with a similar result at home to Dundee United before a devastating 3–0 loss away to Motherwell nearly derailed the sides championship hopes. A last supreme effort was required if the club was to claim a third league title in succession. The final league game of the season was at home to title challengers Aberdeen, with a draw being all that was needed by the Dons to be crowned champions. A tense match ensured but a Mark Hateley brace in front of a 37,652-strong Ibrox crowd gave Rangers the win and the league championship. In his first full season in charge, Smith began to make changes. He brought in Archie Knox from Manchester United, as his assistant and also altered the playing personnel. Smith moved on Trevor Steven for a fee of £5.58 million to Olympique Marseille. Amongst those who also left were Chris Woods, Mo Johnston, Mark Walters to Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Liverpool respectively. Smith, with the financial backing of Chairman David Murray, signed Andy Goram, Alexei Mikhailichenko, Stuart McCall, David Robertson and the perhaps less successful pair of Dale Gordon and Paul Rideout. A fourth successive championship was secured that season, for the first time in over sixty years. Rangers topped the Division with a total of seventy-two points, nine ahead of second-placed Heart of Midlothian. The side scored one hundred and one goals and were victorious in nineteen of their twenty-two away fixtures. The success continued into the Scottish Cup as Rangers won the 1992 final beating Airdrieonians 2–1 to win the trophy for the first time in eleven years. The 1992–93 season was arguably one of the most successful in the club's history and the best European campaign since 1972. Not only did the team win the domestic treble but they also came to within one match of the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final. Rangers saw off English First Division champions Leeds United in a tie dubbed the Battle of Britain. Then, in the group stage, Rangers won two matches and drew four but, despite remaining undefeated, went out to the French team Olympique de Marseille, who were later found guilty of match fixing. No foul play was found with regards to the Rangers matches however. Rangers won the double the following season but missed out on a back-to-back domestic treble after losing in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final to Dundee United. It was a classic giant killing act. United had had a fairly moderate season, winning only eleven of their forty-four league matches. It was United's seventh appearance in a Scottish Cup final, having lost all six of their previous encounters. A forty-seventh minute Craig Brewster goal gave Dundee United a 1–0 win after a sloppy back pass by Dave McPherson. It was a strange end to a very successful domestic season for Rangers. The 1994–95 season saw Rangers make two big money signings, Basile Boli and Brian Laudrup, for £2.7 million and £2.4 million respectively. The latter proved to be an absolute bargain. Laudrup became a firm fans favourite during his four-year spell with Rangers and was even elected to the Rangers Hall of Fame. Boli on the other hand lasted just one season. The French defender completely failed to adapt to the rigours of the Scottish game. Despite the failure of a rather expensive footballer, Rangers continued to rack up the league titles. The sixth consecutive championship won in style. The club sat top of the Scottish Premier Division on sixty-nine points, a whole fifteen points ahead of second placed Motherwell. Yet both domestic cup competitions ended before the last eight and the failure to reached the UEFA Champions League group stage, meant that to many, the season was almost regarded as a failure. Rangers won the championship in season 1995–96 with the help of one Paul Gascoigne. The Englishman was signed 10 July 1995 from Italian side Lazio. He made an instant impact at Rangers, running almost the length of the pitch to score in an Old Firm match at Celtic Park, during the fifth league game of the season. On 30 December 1995, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne 'booked' referee Dougie Smith. Smith had dropped his yellow card and Gascoigne picked it up and showed it to the official, before returning it. Smith was not amused and booked Gascoigne. Rangers went on to win the league, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen. After Rangers went 1–0 down in the early stages, Gascoigne went on to score a hat-trick to give the club a 3–1 victory and the championship. Joining the league crown in the Ibrox trophy cabinet was the 1996 Scottish Cup which Rangers won after a 5–1 defeat of Hearts. A hat-trick from Gordon Durie and a Brian Laudrup double won Rangers their 27th Scottish Cup win. In season 1996–97 Rangers went on to win their ninth championship in a row thereby equalling Celtic's achievement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the cup competitions, they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup at the quarter-finals stage, losing 2–0 to Celtic. But the team won the Scottish League Cup, defeating Hearts 4–3. The European campaign proved to be a disaster. Although the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League after a fine 10–3 aggregate win over Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, they only recorded three points from their six group matches. The season 1997–98 proved to be Walter Smith's last season as manager and Rangers were unable to win their tenth league championship in a row. The early season form of new signing Marco Negri gave the team fresh impetus but when the manager Walter Smith announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season the team's form dipped. The side finished the league on 72 points, two behind champions Celtic after taking the title race to the last day of the season. The club ended the season trophyless for the first time in twelve seasons as they lost the Scottish Cup final to Hearts 2–1 and were knocked out League Cup in the quarter-finals by Dundee United. In Europe, the club failed to reach the Champions League group stages and fell at the first hurdle in the UEFA Cup, losing both legs 2–1 to RC Strasbourg. Smith left Rangers and joined Premier League club Everton. Many players from the Nine in a Row era left Rangers including Brian Laudrup, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Stuart McCall and captain Richard Gough. The Little General. Dick Advocaat, nicknamed the Little General, succeeded Walter Smith on 1 June 1998. Advocaat, former manager of PSV Eindhoven, was only Rangers' tenth manager and the first non-Scot to hold the position. His appointment was viewed as reflecting a desire to begin to challenge Europe's elite clubs. David Murray, the club's owner and chairman, had long proclaimed that Rangers ought to be judged not just in relation to success in Scotland, but on performance in Europe, and especially in the UEFA Champions League. But despite being given resources on a scale never before handed to a Rangers manager, success on a larger stage failed to materialise, and the costly legacy of Advocaat's time at Ibrox was a debt that would cripple the club for years. The scale of these resources made available to Advocaat initially confirmed that the Rangers management was thinking in bold, European terms. Confronted with a rump of players remaining after Smith's departure, Advocaat was furnished with an unprecedented transfer budget over the coming seasons. In total Advocaat spent over £36 million on new players in his debut season. But while Advocaat's record in transfer dealings remained mixed throughout his time at Ibrox, at first the club appeared to be beginning to deliver in playing terms, both in Scotland and (less predictably) Europe. Advocaat's first season saw another domestic treble secured. Performance in Europe was promising, with Bayer Leverkusen defeated in a solid, if unspectacular, UEFA Cup run. In the following season, Advocaat continued to spend big, bringing the likes of Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna to Ibrox. A domestic double was secured in Advocaat's second season. In Europe, too, there were signs of greatly improved performance in the Champions League, as Parma were defeated en route to qualification for the group stages of the competition. Rangers entered Advocaat's third season emboldened by the capture of five of the six domestic trophies available in his first two years. However, while the club again qualified for the Champions League group stage, performances in the league began rapidly to disintegrate. Further high-profile signings – Tore André Flo for a club record £12 million, and the Dutch internationalist Ronald de Boer on a lavish contract – could not reverse the decline. Morale amongst players and supporters plummeted amidst credible rumours of players unrest and dressing room divides. A worsening financial position exacerbated the gathering gloom. The club failed to win a major competition in the 2000–01 season, as Celtic swept the domestic board. Having continued in similar fashion in 2001–02, and with Martin O'Neill's Celtic side once more running away with the championship, Advocaat resigned as manager and took up a general manager position, which he would leave after only 11 months. Alex McLeish was appointed the new Rangers manager in December 2001. Advocaat's tenure at Ibrox had been a paradoxical one. On one hand, Advocaat spearheaded the building of Murray Park – a £14m training complex at Auchenhowie which was viewed as essential if the club was to compete with its European peers in nurturing home-grown talent and developing players. On the other hand, with the club deep in financial difficulty, there was no realistic prospect of boosting its fortunes through further expensive player acquisitions. The challenge of restoring the club to supremacy in Scotland looked to be an unenviable one for Alex McLeish. Financial hangover under McLeish. Murray appointed ex-Aberdeen defender Alex McLeish as the clubs eleventh manager on 11 December 2001, joining McLeish was assistant Andy Watson. Murray's choice of manager was met with a lukewarm reaction amongst many Rangers supporters. Many fans viewed it as symptomatic of the downsizing of the club's ambitions, while others saw in McLeish a manager whose mixed fortunes at Hibernian and Motherwell left him ill-equipped to cope with the demands of managing a high-profile club like Rangers. However, McLeish was the number one managerial target on a four man shortlist. Others said to be included on the list were the then Ipswich Town manager George Burley, former Germany coach Berti Vogts and George Graham. Fans concerns were quickly allayed as McLeish's Rangers team began to display a spirit that had been sorely lacking in the twlight of Advocaat's reign. A Scottish Cup and League Cup double in McLeish's first half-season, 2001–02, saw a renewed sense of optimism that Rangers could regain the ascendancy claimed by Celtic under the managership of Martin O'Neill. A dramatic 3–2 defeat of Celtic in the 2002 Scottish Cup Final, orchestrated by Barry Ferguson and marked by a dramatic Peter Løvenkrands last minute winner, was the perfect end to a disappointing season. In McLeish's first full season as manager, 2002–03, the club won its seventh domestic treble. The Scottish Premier League title was secured after an astonishingly tense run-in. Going into the final round both sides were equal on 94 points but Rangers had a one-goal advantage and sat top of the league. On a dramatic last day, a 6–1 victory over Dunfermline Athletic denied Celtic the title on goal difference after the Parkhead club beat Kilmarnock 4–0. The destination of the title was unknown until the dying seconds of this match as both teams had headed into the game level on points and goal difference. Only a last-minute penalty by Mikel Arteta clinched the win. A victory over Celtic in the 2003 Scottish League Cup Final in March 2003, provided the first leg of the club's latest treble. A somewhat drab and anti-climactic 1–0 victory over Dundee in the 2003 Scottish Cup Final the following May saw a triumphant finalé to the season. It was a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows Viktoria Žižkov. The following season, McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's perilous financial position in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity. The wage bill had to be slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming and unsustainable level of debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players assembled by Advocaat, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer kitty enjoyed by some of his predecessors. McLeish was to lose, from his treble winning squad, the inspirational if mistake-prone defender Lorenzo Amoruso, Scottish international winger Neil McCann and, most damagingly of all, club captain Barry Ferguson. In their place McLeish was required to rebuild with the selective use of Bosman free transfers and loan siginings. After a good start to the 2003–04 season which saw the side top of the league and qualify for UEFA Champions League (thanks to a dramatic late goal in Denmark against FC Copenhagen), the loss of Ferguson shortly afterwards led to a dramatic downturn in results and ultimately a trophyless campaign. McLeish's Bosman signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder Emerson, Norway forward Egil Østenstad and, most damaging of all, the £600,000 signing Nuno Capucho, have since entered Ibrox folklore as some of the worst players to play for Rangers. The 2004–05 season started in the same vein, with McLeish making another poor signing in Serbian midfielder, Dragan Mladenovic, for £1m. The Serb would manage less than ten games for the club. On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new UEFA Cup group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shoot out win over CS Marítimo of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution. After this, his fortunes began to turn again. Mladenovic aside, McLeish had made some canny signings in the summer, such as Nacho Novo, plus the Bosmans Dado Pršo, Jean-Alain Boumsong along with midfielder Alex Rae. Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground on O'Neill's ageing Celtic side. Boumsong, in particular, was a great success but he was sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to then Premier League side Newcastle United (managed by former boss Graeme Souness) for £8m. This cash paved the way for more signings, including Thomas Buffel, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and the return of former captain Barry Ferguson. The 2005 Scottish League Cup Final in March 2005 ended in a 5–1 victory over Motherwell . The league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (with two Old Firm wins, including a pivotal 2–0 victory at Celtic Park in what was McLeish's first win there as Rangers manager) nerves seemed to get the better of Rangers. A loss to Celtic in the last derby of the season at Ibrox, handed a five-point lead to their rivals with only four games of remaining, and seemed to end hopes of the title. However, Rangers kept its winnings way and a 3–1 Celtic home loss to Hibernian meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season. Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at Fir Park. In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously. , Motherwell overcame a 1–0 deficit with two goals in injury time from Scott McDonald to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight 1–0 win at Easter Road. For 89 minutes of the match, Rangers thought their rivals were set for the title, and once news broke of Motherwell's late intervention, ecstasy awaited for the Ibrox legions. Even the helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Motherwell so it had to turn around and fly to Edinburgh. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as ""Helicopter Sunday"". McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title. The 2005–06 season got off to a bad start, with Rangers only winning six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on, statistically, the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win. During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table. It was widely felt that chairman David Murray would let McLeish go after the European campaign had finished, and a press conference arranged two days after the final group match seemed to confirm this. However, Murray seemed to undergo a change of heart and stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely , but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. After this announcement, the team improved, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of Kris Boyd. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run. Yet, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated. Rangers lost 3–0 at home to Hibernian on 4 February to exit the Scottish Cup and end their last realistic hopes of silverware that season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman followed the game.  Overall, McLeish's four-and-a-half-year spell at Ibrox was a turbulent one, coming as it did after the wastefulness of the Advocaat era. McLeish never enjoyed access to the funds his predecessors had been given, and his managership was marked by wildly fluctuating fortunes, in part caused by forced asset stripping of his best players due to the spectre of debt from Advocaat's spending. The lack of money certainly played its part in McLeish's downfall but it is debatable, based on the money he did have to spend, whether greater sums would have been invested wisely. Indeed there is an argument that a good proportion of McLeish's signings have been among the worst in the club's entire history. However, history will look back on McLeish's reign, as a period of tremendous transition on and off the pitch. The False Dawn. After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on 9 February 2006, two days before the crucial Old Firm match, it was announced that McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005–06 season, and on 11 March, it was confirmed that former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen would succeed him at the end of the season. Murray predicted a fruitful reign under Le Guen, describing his capture as ""a massive moonbeam of success"" for the club and promising, ""we’ve got big plans."" He announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced an arrangement with sports retailer JJB Sports. Le Guen was well known for unearthing and nurturing young talent and made an immediate splash in the transfer market. The wave of expectation that was created by Le Guen's appointment was immense and he quickly went about building his own team. In the summer of 2006 he made eleven signings (of them only Saša Papac would be playing for the club the following season). Le Guen spent big money on Filip Šebo, which proved to be wasted as the Slovakian only netted twice during the whole campaign. Other signings including Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Lionel Letizi simply did not perform, while Jérémy Clément was to be in Glasgow for only six months. He signed a young South African player Dean Furman from Chelsea, and French youngsters William Stanger and Antoine Ponroy from Rennes. He allowed more experienced players to leave, Alex Rae, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Peter Løvenkrands and Ronald Waterreus. Rangers' first match under Le Guen was a friendly against Irish Premier League champions Linfield on 6 July 2006 at Windsor Park, Belfast. The side won 2–0 with first-half goals from Kris Boyd and Thomas Buffel. The squad then flew out to South Africa on 9 July for a training camp where they were to play three matches, but defender Fernando Ricksen did not take any part in the tour of South Africa due to what was described by the club as ""unacceptable behaviour"" on the flight to Johannesburg. He returned to Scotland and was subsequently loaned to Zenit St Petersburg on 9 August. Ricksen never played for the club again as his loan spell in Russia was made permanent. The Scottish Premier League season opened on 30 July with Le Guen taking his Rangers side to Fir Park where they defeated Motherwell 2–1. In Le Guen's first competitive game at Ibrox, Rangers were held to a 2–2 draw by Dundee United, and were forced to come back from two goals down. On 11 August Rangers signed Manchester United's then 19-year-old winger Lee Martin on loan for a season. Rangers also recruited the services of Austrian Vienna defender Saša Papac while Marvin Andrews, Olivier Bernard, Robert Malcolm and Hamed Namouchi all departed. With the transfer window closed and five league matches played, Rangers had collected nine points from fifteen. The following two months showed little improvement as the side had sporadic wins and lost the first Old Firm match of the season 2–0. From the seven matches played in September and October 2006, the team won just three and gathered ten points from the twenty-one available. By mid November, Rangers found themselves in third place, a full fifteen points behind leaders Celtic. The odd win was mixed with regular dropped points as the team struggled to find consistency in the early part of the season. The culmination of this poor form could be seen when the side was embarrassingly knocked out of the League Cup by then First Division side St. Johnstone. A dismal 2–0 defeat at Ibrox Stadium on 8 November led to widespread calls for Le Guen to leave. Following the League Cup defeat, there was a slightly gain in form as the side claimed sixteen points from twenty-one, including a 1–1 Old Firm draw thanks to a late-minute Brahim Hemdani equaliser. Rangers also became the first Scottish club to qualify from the UEFA Cup group stage in December 2006, after wins over Livorno, Maccabi Haifa and Partizan Belgrade. Domestic results and performances, however, continued to be inconsistent and in January 2007, Le Guen controversially stripped midfielder Barry Ferguson of the captaincy On 4 January 2007, Le Guen left Rangers by mutual consent. This made him the club's shortest-serving manager, and the only one to leave the club without completing a full season in charge. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published a book which speculated Le Guen left the club because he was being ""undermined"" by other Rangers personnel. Those named were Ferguson and the then club doctor, Ian McGuinness. Walter Smith's return. Following the departure of Paul Le Guen, a number of media sources reported an ""understanding"" that the new management structure would consist of former Rangers manager Walter Smith and former player Ally McCoist, and the SFA confirmed that Rangers enquired about the availability of the pair. However, on 8 January, the SFA rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith. On 10 January 2007, it was announced that Walter Smith was the new manager of Rangers, with Ally McCoist confirmed as assistant manager and Kenny McDowall as first team coach. Smith and his team undertook some serious surgery to the side. He signed experienced defenders David Weir, Ugo Ehiogu and Andy Webster to shore up the rocky backline. This proved to be a steadying influence on the team and they only lost three times until the end of the season, although Webster injured himself during his first training session at the club and did not make his debut until September 2007. The following summer, Smith made ten signings, including defender Carlos Cuéllar and midfielder Lee McCulloch. The early season priority, qualification for the Champions League group stage, was secured after aggregate victories over the champions of the Montenegrin and Serbian leagues, FK Zeta and Red Star Belgrade respectively. Rangers were drawn in Group E, to play FC Barcelona, French champions Olympique Lyonnais and German champions VfB Stuttgart. The campaign started well for Rangers with two victories, 2–1 at home to Stuttgart and 3–0 against Lyon at the Stade Gerland as well as a 0–0 draw against Barcelona at Ibrox Stadium. They lost match day six against Olympique Lyonnais 3–0, which ended their 2007–08 UEFA Champions League run. But the adventure continued as they progressed to the final of the UEFA Cup, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way. They beat Italian side Fiorentina on penalties to set up a final, in Manchester, against Zenit St. Petersburg, who are managed by former Gers manager Dick Advocaat. The team lost that match 2–0, amid serious disturbances caused by small sections of the 100,000-strong Rangers support. Video evidence was released by the Greater Manchester Police of suspected Rangers fans attacking officers in Manchester city centre following the defeat. An appeal was launched on BBC's Crimewatch program in January 2009 in an attempt to trace 49 men in connection with the riots. On the domestic front, the race for the Scottish Premier League continued until the final match-day of the season. Both Celtic and Rangers were tied on 86 points going into their games (against Dundee United and Aberdeen respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal difference of 57, four ahead of Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2–0 defeat away to the Dons. The club had had a ten-point lead in late March. The club appeared in its first final since 2005. They played Dundee United on 16 March 2008 and won the League Cup on penalties. The match was tied 2–2 after extra time, with both goals coming from Kris Boyd who also scored the winning spot kick. They also reached the 2009 Scottish Cup Final, the club's 50th appearance in a Scottish Cup final. The side had beaten St. Johnstone 4–3 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1–1 after extra time. The final was against Queen of the South and played on 24 May 2008. Rangers won the match 3–2 thanks to goals from DaMarcus Beasley and a double from Kris Boyd. The 2008–09 season began disastrously as the club exited the UEFA Champions League and European football altogether, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas in the second qualifying round. The first leg at Ibrox finished goalless, but the return leg ended in defeat for Rangers after an 87th-minute header from Linas Pilibaitis. The financial consequences of the failures to qualify for the Champions League were revealed when the club posted a loss of £3.9 million for the six months to December 2008, and in March decided to offer staff the option of voluntary redundancy as a way of cutting costs. There was also mounting pressure on the manager to reduce the first team squad from 28 players to a more manageable figure. The player excess was eased slightly with the departures of Chris Burke, Jean-Claude Darcheville and a couple out on loan deals but the increased debt meant that the club needed to find a cash injection. This resulted in the attempted sale of Kris Boyd to Birmingham City, which fell through due to the player's wage demands. In the first Old Firm game of the season, Rangers won 4–2, with Pedro Mendes scoring his first goal for the club, and Kenny Miller scoring a double against his former employers. But the team's league form stuttered thereafter. Despite a run of five wins from six matches following the Old Firm victory, the side trailed Celtic by seven points in the league at the turn of the year. For the first few months of 2009' both sides dropped and gained points on the other and Rangers briefly took over top spot of the Scottish Premier League on 21 February after a win against Kilmarnock. The spell as league leaders lasted less than a fortnight. A defeat and a draw, both at home, to Inverness and Hearts respectively, saw Smith's side sit second in the table, one point behind Celtic, at the split. The fourth Old Firm league meeting of the season finished with a 1–0 win to Rangers, thanks to a Steven Davis strike. This meant that, with three league games remaining, Rangers were two points ahead of Celtic. Further twists and turns followed, both Old Firm sides drew their matches against Hibernian at Easter Road, and so Rangers were ahead by two points with one round of matches remaining. Smith's side just needed a win against Dundee United to guarantee the club's 52nd league title. That is exactly what they got, goals from Kyle Lafferty, Pedro Mendes and Kris Boyd sealed a 3–0 win and the clubs first league championship in four seasons. The club played in the finals of both of the domestic cup competitions for the second season running. The 2009 Scottish League Cup Final was reached by defeating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Falkirk en route but the final ended in a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Old Firm rivals Celtic after extra time. The match was Walter Smith's first ever Old Firm final and was marred by a Kirk Broadfoot sending off deep into extra time for a foul on Aiden McGeady inside the penalty box. Celtic were subsequently awarded a penalty which McGeady himself converted. Rangers qualified for the 2009 Scottish Cup Final after beating St. Mirren 3–0 in the semi-final. The second goal of the game was scored by Kris Boyd and was his 100th goal for Rangers. The team faced Falkirk at Hampden Park on 30 May 2009 in what was the clubs 51st Scottish Cup Final appearance. A Nacho Novo strike in the first minute of the second half gave Rangers a 1–0 win and completed the domestic double. The following season saw Rangers financial problems continue. A quiet summer in terms of transfer arrivals contrasted to the outgoings. The club removed eleven players who had made first team appearances from the wage bill on permanent and loan deals. The only addition to the playing staff was Jérôme Rothen on a season loan, Rothen was the first player to sign for the club in over a year. On 26 August, chairman David Murray stepped down and was replaced by non-executive director Alastair Johnston. Johnston stated that one of his main priorities was to find a buyer for owner Murray's shares. On 24 October, Rangers manager Walter Smith was reported to say that Lloyds Banking Group, who the club was in debt to, was ""effectively running the club"". On 12 November, the extent of the clubs financial problems was shown to be £31 million in debt, a rise of £10m from the previous year. On the field, Rangers' Scottish Premier League title defence got off to a stuttering start, three wins in the league was followed by three draws, the first Old Firm victory of the season was followed by poor performances against St. Johnstone and dropped points at home to Hibernian. The side lost their first league match of the season away to Aberdeen on 28 November but then embarked on a six match winning run, scoring 26 goals in the process. At the start of 2010, Rangers sat at the top of the league. The second Old Firm fixture finished in a 1–1 draw. Rangers had a ten-point lead by mid-February. Rangers won the third Old Firm match 1–0 thanks to an injury time winner from Maurice Edu which all but secured the title. The side had to wait nearly two months to be confirmed as champions due to dropping points to St. Johnstone and Dundee United. On 25 April, Rangers won their 53rd league title after defeating Hibernian 1–0 at Easter Road. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after a 1–0 victory over St. Mirren in the final, despite being reduced to nine men with Danny Wilson and Kevin Thomson being sent off. However, Rangers were unable to retain the Scottish Cup after losing 1–0 to eventual winners Dundee United in a quarter-final replay. Rangers were seeded in pot two of the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time. The club was drawn against Spanish team Sevilla, German outfit Stuttgart and Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. A 1–1 away draw in Germany was followed by two consecutive 4–1 defeats at home to Sevilla and Unirea, the latter being regarded as one of the club's worst-ever European results. Rangers were left with a small chance of qualifying from the group after a 1–1 draw in the return leg with Unirea, a match that saw trouble in the Rangers fans section of the stadium. The club was charged by UEFA for inappropriate conduct and following an investigation fined €20,000 plus ordered to pay the cost of repairing the damage to the stadium infrastructure caused by its supporters. The side finished bottom of their group and was knocked out of European football altogether after two defeats from in the final two matches. With financial problems at the club ongoing, the summer of 2010 began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad. Smith had to decided whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven, he opted for quality. Both sides of the Old Firm began the season with eight league wins in a row, however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3-1 victory over Celtic and took early control of the league. A 1-1 draw at home to Inverness CT the following weekend ended Rangers 100% start to the season and a home defeat to Hibernian inflicted the teams first league defeat of the season, the first of five. The cold spell in the winter of 2010-11 saw many postponements and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic but with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the Old Firm, Celtic came out on top and mathematical lead the table, for the first time that season. However Celtic's advantage was short lived after a loss to Motherwell the following week. This allowed Rangers to regain top spot, but 3-2 loss to Dundee United at Ibrox followed by a 0-0 draw in the final Old Firm fixture left the title in Celtic's hands, with just four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season; on 3 May, Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness and so with three matches remaining Rangers had a one-point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring 11 goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after beating Celtic 2-1 AET. However, Rangers lost 1-0 to Celtic in the fifth round replay in Scottish Cup. The match was marked by several incidents, three Rangers players were sent off and Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist were involved in a bust-up. In Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages for the second season in a row. They drew Manchester United, Valencia and Bursaspor. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford, a 1-0 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia. A 3-0 defeat in Spain to Valencia followed by a 1-0 loss at home to Manchester United ended Rangers chances of qualifying for the last 16, but third place and a spot in the UEFA Europa League was already secured with Bursaspor having failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match, Rangers drew 1-1 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. However, Rangers did make it to the last 16 of the Europa League, beating Sporting Lisbon on away goals in the last 32 but lost to PSV Eindhoven on aggregate. On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) for £1 to Wavetower Limited, a company ultimately owned by businessman Craig Whyte. Ally McCoist and Insolvency. Smith's deputy and Rangers record goalscorer Ally McCoist was appointed manager of the club for season 2011-12. Hampered by a bizarre transfer policy under Whyte, Rangers found themselves knocked out of first the UEFA Champions League and then the UEFA Europa League by the end of August, depriving the club of income that may have been anticipated. With the new ownership there initially appeared to be some financial stability of the club. A number of first-team regulars were secured on long-term contract extensions including Steven Davis, Allan McGregor, Steven Whittaker and Gregg Wylde. When McCoist entered the transfer market, his first signing being Almería midfielder Juan Manuel Ortiz, he soon encountered difficulties. A number of highly publicised failed transfers, including deals for Wesley Verhoek and Roland Juhász, lead to many doubting Whyte’s financial prowess. Rangers' first Scottish Premier League match of the season was a home match against Jim Jefferies' Hearts, where the league flag was unfurled by then chairman Craig Whyte, as Rangers were under considerable pressure for most of the first half but managed to salvage a draw. The following week, McCoist claimed his first competitive victory as manager with a win over St. Johnstone. The season proved to be a baptism of fire for McCoist, by early October the club held a ten-point lead over Celtic, and on 5 November the lead stood at fifteen points over Celtic and twelve over second placed Motherwell. However, a draw with St. Johnstone and subsequent defeats to Kilmarnock, St. Mirren and Old Firm rivals Celtic, who then went on a run of twenty-one matches undefeated saw Rangers slip to second place where the club remained for the rest of the season. Rangers' European adventure began in the middle of the final week of July, where Rangers were defeated by underdogs Malmö 1-0 at home and Rangers crashed out of the Champions League with a bad tempered 1-1 draw in Sweden in which both Steven Whittaker and Madjid Bougherra were both given their marching orders, and ultimately relegating the Gers to the Europa League play-off round, where they faced Slovenian team NK Maribor. In cup competitions the club fared no better, a third round defeat to First Division side Falkirk in the League Cup and a fifth round exit at home to Dundee United. On 13 February 2012, Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of their intention to appoint administrators. Rangers officially entered administration on the following day, appointing London-based financial advisers Duff & Phelps as administrators. Rangers entered administration over an alleged non-payment of £9m in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs. On entering administration, the team was deducted ten-points by the SPL, a move regarded as 'effectively ending' its 2012 championship challenge. A failure then to submit accounts for 2011 meant the club was not granted a licence to play in European football in season 2012–13. In April it was revealed that the club's total debts could be as high as £134m. On 13 May it was revealed that Whyte sold his controlling interest in The Rangers Football Club Plc for £2 to a consortium led by Charles Green. Green offered the creditors a settlement, in the fom of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in an attempt to exit administration. On 12 June 2012, it emerged that HMRC would reject the CVA put forward by Green. Green's takeover of the club depended on the CVA being accepted by HMRC, which would have seen £8.5m of the total debt repaid. The formal rejection of the CVA, two days later, meant that The Rangers Football Club plc entered the liquidation process. The company's business and assets (including its History and silverware) were sold to a company called Sevco Scotland Ltd, a consortium led by Green, in a deal worth £5.5m. Sevco was subsequently renamed The Rangers Football Club Ltd at the end of July 2012. Ten of the other eleven SPL clubs voted against allowing Rangers to transfer their SPL membership share to a new company on 4 July 2012, leaving the club applying for a place in the Scottish Football League. On 13 July, 25 out of 30 SFL member clubs voted to place Rangers FC into the Third Division of the Irn-Bru Scottish Football League from the start of the season. Rangers clinched the Scottish Third Division Title on 30 March after a goalless draw away to Montrose and Queen's Park lost. Rangers are promoted to the Scottish Second Division next season. "
wikipedia-3913050," Wojtek Wolski  Wojtek Wolski (pronounced: ""VOY-tek VOL-skee""; born February 24, 1986) is a Polish-Canadian professional ice hockey left winger currently playing for the Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). In the NHL, he has played for the Colorado Avalanche, Phoenix Coyotes, New York Rangers, Florida Panthers, and the Washington Capitals. During the 2012 NHL lockout, he played for KH Sanok in the PLH, the top-tier hockey league in Poland. While he holds dual citizenship, Wolski is a product of the Canadian training system and is currently ineligible to represent Poland internationally. Playing career. Junior. Wolski was drafted in the first round, 21st overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Colorado Avalanche. It was originally believed that he would be the 10th-15th pick, but some teams passed on him because he was charged with assault causing bodily harm by Toronto police shortly before the draft. Wolski allegedly beat and hospitalized another young man his age at a birthday party. The case was dismissed when it was learned that Wolski was defending his girlfriend, who had been pushed off a porch.  Prior to being drafted, Wolski attended St. Michael's College School and played for the Buzzers hockey team in 2001–02. Before making the Avalanche roster, he recorded 14 franchise records as a member of the OHL's Brampton Battalion, and earned the award for Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2006. Wolski was the OHL Player of the Month an unprecedented four months in a row (December, January, February, and March). He was also an Alternate captain for Ontario's Under-17 team at the 2003 Canada Winter Games. Wolski suited up for Team Canada in the 2004 Canada/Russia Series and was voted Player of the Game (Team Cherry) for 2004 CHL Top Prospects Game. Professional. Wolski made his Avalanche debut in the 2006 playoffs and marked a sensational debut with three points (one goal, two assists). In his first full professional season, Wolski played in the NHL YoungStars Game on January 23, 2007, a part of the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game festivities held in Dallas. He recorded two points (two assists) for the Western Conference. In the 2008-09 season, Wolski demonstrated his scoring talent in shootouts. At season's end, he would score 10 times out of 12 attempts, establishing a single season record in percentage of shootout goals scored. His 14 goals and 28 assists would be good enough to finish third on the Avs with 42 points, behind Milan Hejduk and Ryan Smyth. On March 3, 2010, Wolski was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes for Peter Mueller and Kevin Porter. In his first game with the Coyotes, he scored the game-winning goal against his former team, the Avalanche, with just 22 seconds left in the 3rd period. Three days later, in his second game with the Coyotes, he scored again in a 4-0 win against the Anaheim Ducks. On June 28, 2010, Wolski resigned a two-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. Since joining Phoenix, he switched from the number 8 he wore in Colorado (already in use by Scottie Upshall) to number 86, becoming the second NHL player to wear that number (Jonathan Ferland played 7 games for Montreal in 2006 wearing number 86). In the 2010-11 season, Wolski failed to recapture his scoring pace from after last years trade from Colorado. With a steadily diminished role with the Coyotes he was traded for the second time within a year to the New York Rangers for Michal Rozsival on January 10, 2011. Wolski also failed to click with the Rangers, building a reputation as a player who ""would rather not play in tough areas to score"", he was a healthy scratch on more than one occasion. On February 25, 2012, Wolski was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a Michael Vernace and a third round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Wolski joined his fifth team in just over two years when he signed a one-year $600,000 free agent deal with the Washington Capitals for the 2012-13 season on July 11, 2012. During the 2012 NHL lockout, Wolski joined KH Sanok, the top team at the time in the PLH, the top-tier hockey league in Poland. He rejoined the Washington Capitals at the start of the NHL season. Personal. Wolski left Poland with his parents and older brother Kordian in 1989. Two years later, by way of West Germany, they finally landed in Toronto, Ontario. He learned how to skate at a local outdoor skating rink in Etobicoke using his brother's skates, which were a few sizes too big. In order to make them fit, he would wear three pairs of socks and stuff the front of the boot with newspapers. The first NHL game he attended as a young boy was the Colorado Avalanche versus the Toronto Maple Leafs at Maple Leaf Gardens. He followed the Avalanche as his favorite team ever since then, and grew to idolize future teammate Joe Sakic before coincidentally being drafted by Colorado himself. During 2006-2007 Wolski dated Canadian actress Ashley Leggat while playing for the Avalanche. "
wikipedia-3913136," Conjugated protein  A conjugated protein is a protein that functions in interaction with other chemical groups attached by covalent bonds or by weak interactions. Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The nonamino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups. Some examples of conjugated proteins are lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, hemoproteins, flavoproteins, metalloproteins, phytochromes, cytochromes and opsins. Hemoglobin contains the prosthetic group containing iron, which is the heme. It is within the heme group that carries the oxygen molecule through the binding of the oxygen molecule to the iron ion (Fe2+) found in the heme group.  Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes. References. Nelson DL, Cox MM (2005).

wikipedia-3913176," Victor Kiam  Victor K. Kiam (7 December 1926 – 27 May 2001) was an American entrepreneur and the owner of the New England Patriots football team from 1988–1991. Biography. After attending Yale, the Sorbonne and Harvard Business School, Kiam worked for Lever Brothers and Playtex as a salesperson. He first made his fortune as the President and CEO of Remington Products, which he famously purchased after his wife bought him his first electric shaver. In 1994, Victor Kiam sold a controlling interest in Remington Products to Isaac Perlmutter. Kiam also operated two other companies: Ronson and TravelSmart. Kiam also bought the Benrus Watch Company in 1968, selling his majority stake in 1977. Kiam became famous as the spokesperson for the Remington shaver. Kiam's famous catchphrase, ""I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company"", made him a household name. He recorded each advertisement in the native language for the country in which it was broadcast. In the UK he became a celebrity appearing on TV chat shows including 'Wogan', 'The Tube' and David Frost's 'Through the Keyhole'.  In 1988, Kiam bought the NFL's New England Patriots for $84 million from founder Billy Sullivan. The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a ""Boston Herald"" reporter sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions. ""I can't disagree with the players' actions,"" he said, and claimed that the Herald ""asked for trouble"" by assigning a female reporter to cover the Patriots. He made headlines when he reportedly described Olson as a ""classic bitch."" The case was reportedly settled for approximately $250,000, Kiam took out a full-page ad in the Herald to apologize, and three players were fined. Despite his apology, he drew audience groans six months later when he spoke at an athletics banquet and asked, ""Do you know what Lisa Olson has in common with the Iraqis? They've both seen Patriot missiles up close.""  By 1992 Kiam was facing bankruptcy. He was in considerable debt to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein, and was forced to sell his 51 percent stake in the Patriots to him in part to service the debt. Orthwein would eventually sell that stake to Kraft only two years later after an aborted attempt to move the Patriots to St. Louis. Death. Kiam resided in Stamford, Connecticut at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, and three children, Lisa Durkin, Victor ""Tory"" Kiam III, and Robin Kiam Aviv, and seven grandchildren, Jenny, Alexander, Sophia, Lia, Caleigh, Nikki, and Blake. Upon Kiam's death ""The Times"" quoted one of his closest business associates in later years, Jonathon Lyons, as saying that he was ""a truly remarkable entrepreneur of the old kind – the kind they simply don't make any more."" Bibliography. Kiam wrote the following books about business and entrepreneurship: "
wikipedia-3913362," Gresham's School  Gresham’s School is an independent coeducational boarding school in Holt in North Norfolk, England. The school was founded in 1555 by Sir John Gresham as a free grammar school for forty boys, following King Henry VIII's dissolution of the Augustinian priory at Beeston Regis. The founder left the school's endowments in the hands of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of the City of London, who are still the school's trustees. In the 1890s, an increase in the rental income of property in the City of London led to a major expansion of the school, which built many new buildings on land it owned on the eastern edge of Holt, including several new boarding houses as well as new teaching buildings, library, and chapel. Gresham's began to admit girls in the mid-1970s and is now fully co-educational. As well as its senior school, it operates a preparatory and a Pre-Prep school, the latter now in the Old School House, the original senior school. Altogether, the three schools teach about eight hundred children. History. The School. Gresham's School at Holt was founded by Sir John Gresham by letters patent of 1555, during the reign of Queen Mary I. For its home he gave the school his manor house at Holt, which he had bought in 1546 from his elder brother Sir William Gresham. The founding of Gresham's was connected to King Henry VIII's suppression of the Priory of Augustinian canons at Beeston Regis in June 1539. The priory, established in 1216, had operated a school which John Gresham and his brothers probably attended, but the school came to an end with the priory, leaving no provision for education in the vicinity of Holt. The new school opened and was granted a Royal Charter in 1562. By the letters patent of 1555, the school was called in full 'The Free Grammar School of Sir John Gresham, knight, citizen and alderman of London'. The founder endowed Gresham's generously, placing its property in trust with the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of London, and full estate records dating from the school's foundation are held at the Guildhall Library. Sir John Gresham's endowments included his freehold property in Holt and Letheringsett, his wood and land called Prior's Grove, his manors of Pereers and Holt Hales, ""with all and singular to the same belonging, situate in Holt, Sherington, Letheringsett, Bodham, Kellinge, Wayborne, Semlingham, Stodrye, Bantrye, and West Wickham, in the said county of Norfolk"", and also tenements called 'The White Hind' and 'The Peacock' in the parish of St Giles's Without, Cripplegate, in the City of London. Close links with the Fishmongers' Company continue to this day. By his Will of 1601, Leonard Smith, a fishmonger of London, left £120 and all his goods to establish a fellowship at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and in 1604 'Mr Smith's Fellowship' was confirmed by the College, with the provision that ""scholars from the Grammar School of Holt, in Norfolk"" were to have preference. The School Library contains the Foundation Library, a collection of books and manuscripts provided at the school's establishment in 1555 and later. On Christmas Day 1650, the Reverend Thomas Cooper, MA, a former usher of Gresham's, was hanged for his part in a Royalist rebellion on behalf of Charles II. His body was left hanging on a gibbet in Holt's Market Place. For three hundred and fifty years, the School was based in what is now called the Old School House, or ""OSH"", the former manor house of Holt overlooking the Market Place in the town centre. In 1708, the school escaped a major fire which destroyed most of the rest of the mediaeval town of Holt. This resulted in most of the buildings now to be seen in the town centre belonging to the eighteenth century. In 1729, the Fishmongers' Company presented the school with ""...a valuable and useful library, not only of the best editions of the Classics and Lexicographers, but also with some books of Antiquities, Chronology, and Geography, together with a suitable pair of globes"". By the eighteenth century, references to fish were hard to find in the court minutes of the Fishmongers' Company, and the company's main business had become managing its extensive property and administering its charities and trusts, such as the school at Holt and St Peter's Hospital, an almshouse at Newington in Surrey. For the period 1704 to 1750, the Rev. Charles Linnell has analysed the 'Status of fathers of boys at Holt Grammar School' in his ""Gresham's School History and Register"" (1955): ""Sons of gentlemen 10%, clergy 30%, professional men 5%, tradesmen 20%, plebeian 15%, unknown 20%"". One of the school's 18th century heads was John Holmes, appointed at the age of twenty-seven, a prolific writer of educational textbooks who led the school between 1730 and his death in 1760. In the 19th century, boys were strictly required to attend services at the Holt parish church, and in November 1815 a boy called Charles Loynes was ""expelled for non-attendance at church"". In 1823, the expenditure of the Fishmongers' Company on the school was £367, of which £158 10s was for the Master's salary, allowances and gratuities, £80 for the Usher's salary, board and lodging, £52 11s 6d for repairs, £22 12s 6d for taxes, £15 15s 6d for poor rates, £12 10s for coals, £9 13s 4d for two-thirds of the cost of the school books, and £6 6s for a School Feast which took place in June. In 1836, 'The Wardens and Commonalty of the Art and Mystery of Fishmongers of the City of London' held an insurance policy for 'Other property or occupiers: Free Grammar School Holt Norfolk (Rev Benn. Pulleyn)' with the Sun Fire Office. In his ""History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of London"" (1836), William Herbert says of the school: Herbert also notes that the officers of the court of the Fishmongers' Company include ""a steward of the Holt free school, in Norfolk"". John William Burgon, in ""The Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham"" (1839), after listing the estates with which Sir John Gresham endowed the school, says  Burgon goes on, however, to add  The Old School was rebuilt and converted in 1859. In 1880, a Commission was appointed to enquire into the City of London Livery Companies. When it published its first reports in 1881 the following formed part of a 'Supplementary Statement on behalf of the Fishmongers' Company' included in Volume 1: In the early 1900s, under an ambitious headmaster called George Howson (who had moved to Gresham's from Uppingham), the school expanded onto a new campus of some at the eastern edge of the town, while keeping the Old School House as one of its houses. When Howson arrived at Gresham's, he found it in numbers much as it had been when founded in 1555: in 1900 there were only forty ""Holt Scholars"", plus seven boarders. The New School (by the architect Sir John Simpson) was opened by Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood on 30 September 1903. This consisted of School House (renamed Howson's in 1919) and the Main Building, including Big School. Woodlands was acquired and opened as a new house in 1905, the school's first swimming pool was opened in 1907, and Farfield was built in 1911. The School Chapel was completed in 1916, during the Great War, during which one hundred Old Greshamians were killed. Gresham's was one of the first schools in England to abolish corporal punishment. In March 1921 the school's headmaster, J. R. Eccles, commenting to ""The Times"", ""condemned corporal punishment of any kind"". The Thatched Buildings, the gift of the headmaster, were opened by Sir Arthur Shipley in February 1921. In 1923, Sir Harry Brittain asked Edward Wood, President of the Board of Education in the House of Commons ""whether he will explain why Gresham's school, Holt, was admitted to the benefits of the Superannuation Act although it is an endowed school, owning all its buildings and supported by a wealthy city company?"" A new school library, designed by the architect Alan E. Munby, was opened in 1931 by Field Marshal Lord Milne. In the 1930s, there were three categories of scholarship in the senior school: Holt ""A"" scholarships gave complete exemption from fees, County Scholarships were worth £100 a year, and Fishmongers' Company Open Scholarships were worth £50 a year. The school was evacuated to Newquay in Cornwall during the Second World War, between June 1940 and March 1944. Martin Burgess's memories of Gresham's during the freezing months of January to March 1947, the coldest British winter on record, are quoted at length in ""I Will Plant Me a Tree"" (2002). Not only was the winter icy cold, but because of fuel shortages the school was unheated. Burgess recalls that ""Periods were held in full overcoats and scarves and gloves. If it happened now the School would be closed, but such a step was not even thought of then. In any case, the roads were blocked... One day the School was called out to dig out a farm, or was it a small village? Hurrah! No periods! In the afternoon everyone prayed there would be periods, it was so cold. A man had died."" Under the long headship of Logie Bruce Lockhart (1955–1982), there was a further period of change and expansion. Kenwyn, a new Junior School House, was built and opened in 1958. The bridge over the Cromer Road was opened in 1962, and was initiated after the tragic death of Kirsty, LBL's daughter, while crossing Cromer Road in front of Howson's. Tallis, a new boys' house named after John Tallis, Master of the school for more than thirty years in the first half of the seventeenth century, was built and opened in 1963 as were the biology classrooms and music rooms. Oakeley became the first girls' house in 1971, when girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form only. The school became fully co-educational in the 1970s. There are now four boarding houses for boys and three for girls (see ""Houses"" section below), as well as a wide range of buildings. These include Big School, the School Chapel, the Auden Theatre, the Cairns Centre, the School Library, the Music Centre, the Central Block, the Thatched Classrooms, the Reith Laboratories, the Biology Building, the Armoury, and others. In February 2005, Gresham's School's 450th anniversary was marked by a service at Norwich Cathedral attended by the school's Patron, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and 1,500 past and present Greshamians. In July 2005, the Eastern Daily Press called it """"a school which changed the world."""" When Philip John, formerly head of King William's College, arrived to take over the head mastership in September 2008, the ""Tatler Schools Guide"" commented ""It will be interesting to observe the impact of mathematician Philip John.""

OG groups include the main OG Club, open to all former pupils, which publishes a magazine and has almost four thousand members; the OG Golf Society, the OG Cricket Team, the OG Rifle Establishment (OGRE) which has its own residence at Bisley, and the OG Masonic Lodge. The Lodge was formed in January 1939. Houses. Most Gresham's students are boarders and live in one of the school's seven houses. Four of these are for boys: Howson's (1903), Woodlands (1905), Farfield (1911), and Tallis (1961). Three houses are for girls: Oakeley (1971), Edinburgh (1984), and Britten (1992). Edinburgh was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the school's Patron, after whom it is named. Britten is an extension of the former school Sanatorium. Each house has a house-master or house-mistress and a house-tutor and matron. There are house teams for team sports, as well as other house activities, such as evening prayers, ""prep"", and dramatic productions. Most houses are around seventy strong. Senior boys and girls may be appointed as house prefects. Some of those are then chosen as school prefects, and one in each house as House Captain. The Old School House was previously the whole school, then from 1905 to 1936 the Junior House, then from 1936 to 1993 a boarding house of the Senior School and is now the home of the Gresham's pre-preparatory school. Junior Schools. The former Junior School of Gresham's was reorganized into a Preparatory School and a Pre-Preparatory School in 1984, both on their own sites at Holt, with their own heads and staff. Like the Senior School, both are fully co-educational. The Preparatory school has over two hundred children between the ages of eight and thirteen and takes full and weekly boarders as well as day pupils. Many continue into the Senior School. The school's Kenwyn House was once a house of the Senior School called Bengal Lodge. The Pre-Preparatory School is housed in the Old School House and is a day school for one hundred boys and girls between the ages of three and eight. Admission to the school. In most cases, admission to the senior school of Gresham's depends on success at the Common Entrance Examination, usually taken between the ages of eleven and thirteen. Common Entrance has three compulsory core subjects, English, Maths and Science, and other papers can be chosen from French, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Geography, History, and Religious Studies. The school also has its own entrance examination for candidates from maintained schools. Curriculum. The school teaches most subjects of the mainstream humanistic curriculum. While only limited choices between courses need to be made for GCSE, in the Sixth form at A-level pupils choose three or four subjects, and most combinations are possible. The school has been an International Baccalaureate World School (IB code 003433), offering the IB Diploma Programme, since February 2007. The aim of the school is to give a good all-round education and to prepare pupils for university entry and for other careers, such as the armed forces. Most Greshamians move on to top British universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick, St Andrews, Bristol, Durham, York and Edinburgh. School terms. The school's year is divided into three terms, Michaelmas (early September to mid December), Lent (early January to the Easter holiday) and Summer (the Easter holiday to mid July). In the middle of each term there is a half-term holiday, usually a week long. For boarders, there are also other ""home weekends"". The academic year begins with the Michaelmas term and ends with the Summer term, so starts at the end of the summer holiday. Discipline. Misbehaving students are given punishments ranging from RLP (Red lined paper, generally copying out of a textbook), EP (Extra Period, happening at lunchtimes on Mondays and Fridays) to permanent exclusion. School sports. Apart from its sports grounds for cricket, rugby football, hockey, and soccer, the school has its own indoor swimming pool, squash, tennis and badminton courts, gymnasium and extensive school woods. It owns a boat-house at Barton Broad and a shooting lodge at Bisley, as well as a shooting range at the school. The principal school sports for boys are rugby (Michaelmas Term), hockey (Lent Term), and cricket (Summer Term). There is a wide range of other school sports, including tennis, badminton, soccer, squash, golf, martial arts, swimming, riding, sailing, cross-country running, shooting and canoeing. As an alternative to formal sports, Gresham's students may take part in 'School Works', chiefly forestry activities in the woodland attached to the main school campus. An Old Greshamian, Richard Leman, was a member of the gold-medal winning British hockey squad at the 1988 Summer Olympics and of the bronze-medal winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Another OG, Gawain Briars, was the British number one squash player and now heads the world Professional Squash Association. Brother and sister Ralph and Natasha Firman are both racing drivers, and Natasha was the winner of the inaugural Formula Woman championship in 2004. Giles Baring and Andrew Corran were first-class cricketers, while international rugby footballers include Andy Mulligan (Ireland and the British and Irish Lions, Nick Youngs (England and his sons Ben and Tom (England) both also playing for the British and Irish Lions winning team in Australia in 2013). In rifle-shooting, Gresham's has been one of the top ten schools in England for about sixty years, and Glyn Barnett won a shooting Gold Medal in the 2006 Commonwealth Games at Melbourne. In the field of winter sports, the 11th Earl of Northesk took an Olympic medal for toboganning (then called 'skeleton') in 1928. Notable mountaineers have included Tom Bourdillon, Percy Wyn-Harris, Peter Lloyd and Matthew Dickinson. Religion. Gresham's is a Church of England foundation, but the school is open to all denominations and religions. Services are a focal point of the School's life, with a morning assembly in Chapel on four mornings of the week. Pupils not in the Sixth form have an extra morning in chapel, whilst the sixth form have another tutor period (Thursday morning). All years have a tutor period on Wednesday. The Saturday morning service is a choral practice, and Holy Communion may be taken on Sundays. There are also formal prayers in most boarding houses in the evenings. Non-Anglicans are excused communion services on Sundays, and Roman Catholics attend mass on Sunday at the church of Our Lady and St Joseph in Sheringham. If wished, boys and girls may be prepared at the School for Confirmation into the Church of England, which is usually conducted by the Bishop of Norwich or one of his suffragan Bishops. The school was designated as having a Church of England religious character by the Designation of Schools Having a Religious Character (Independent Schools) (England) Order 2004 (No 72). The tune called ""Woodlands"", the usual setting for the hymn Lift Up Your Hearts!, was composed for the school in 1916 by Walter Greatorex, a Gresham's master, who succeeded another composer, Geoffrey Shaw, as the school's Director of Music. A new school chapel, by the Scottish architect Maxwell Ayrton, was built between 1912 and 1916, and is now a listed building. The foundation stone of the chapel was laid by the chairman of governors, Sir Edward Busk, on 8 June 1912. The Chapel bell, cast in Whitechapel in 1915, is inscribed with the words ""Ring in the Christ that is to be, Donum Dedit J. R. E."". The last words stand for ""the gift of J. R. Eccles"" (at the time second master, later headmaster), while the first eight are the last line of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem ""Ring Out, Wild Bells"" (1850). The Gresham family motto, ""Fiat voluntas tua"" ('Thy will be done') appears on the chapel's main door. Old Greshamians include several bishops, David Hand, Archbishop of Papua New Guinea, and John Bradburne, a candidate for canonization. Out of school activities. There is a School Orchestra, a School Choir, a Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme (more than five hundred Gold Awards have been achieved since its inception in 1972), and a large number of school clubs, such as the Debating Society, the Natural History Society, the Sailing Club, the Kayak Club and the Chess Club. North Norfolk Divers, a branch of the British Sub-Aqua Club, is based at the school. A school play is produced at the end of every Summer Term, and each house also produces a play once a year. There are also many visits to concerts, plays and other outside events. In 1922, W. H. Auden played the Shrew in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and in 1925 he played Caliban in ""The Tempest"". Combined Cadet Force. Gresham's has a long military tradition, from Sir Christopher Heydon, who took part in the capture of Cádiz in 1596, to Tom Wintringham, commander of the British Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War, and General Sir Robert Bray, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Before the Second World War, the school had an Officers Training Corps. During the 1940s, OTCs in British schools were renamed 'Junior Training Corps', and the school's JTC was amalgamated into the Combined Cadet Force in April, 1948, which continues to provide military training. The CCF's Army section is now associated with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment (previously with the Royal Norfolk Regiment, to 1959, and the 1st East Anglian Regiment, 1959 to 1964) and has some 270 students as cadets. About another 130 are in the CCF's Air section, and training takes place on one afternoon of each week. Activities include shooting, expeditions, combat manoeuvres, ambush and continuity drills, signals training, orienteering, climbing, kayaking, line-laying, first aid and lifesaving, motor mechanics, and hovercraft construction. A Biennial Review of the Gresham's School CCF Contingent was carried out on 10 May 2006 by General Sir Richard Dannatt KCB CBE MC, Commander-in-Chief Land Command and Chief of the General Staff designate. Scholarships. Scholarships are available, giving a reduction in school fees. These include Open Academic Scholarships, Music, Art and Drama Scholarships, Lockhart Academic Scholarships, Edinburgh Scholarships, Fishmongers' Company Open Scholarships and Fishmongers' Art Scholarships, Sports Scholarships and All Rounder Scholarships. There is also an award called the 450th Anniversary Boarding Award. Examinations for Academic Scholarships are held every February for admission the following September, while Scholarships in Music, Sport, Art, and Drama are awarded on the basis of interviews and practical work. Sixth Form Scholarships for Sport, Music, Art, and academic distinction are awarded in December for the two years beginning the following September and are open to external and internal candidates. The maximum value of a Scholarship is half of the school's fees, but the value may be increased by a bursary in cases of financial need. Roughly one in four Gresham's pupils hold a scholarship, and about one in eight receive a bursary for financial need. Fees. The school's annual fees for the academic year 2013–14 are: In September 2005, Gresham's was one of the leading British schools (including Ampleforth, Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Bedford, Haileybury, Marlborough, Rugby, Shrewsbury, Stowe, Wellington and Winchester) which were considered by the Office of Fair Trading to be operating a fee-fixing cartel in breach of the Competition Act 1998. All of the schools were ordered to abandon the practice of exchanging information on their planned fees. Governing body. More than half of the school's Governing Body represent the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, who have been the school's trustees since 1555. The Chairman of Governors (currently Mr A.N.G. Duckworth-Chad, D.L., a Norfolk landowner) is always a past or present Prime Warden of the Fishmongers' Company. A previous Chairman was the late Admiral Earl Cairns, after whom the school's Cairns Centre is named. The present Prime Warden, Sir Richard Carew Pole, is also a governor. The governing body includes a representative of Cambridge University, currently Lady Perry of Southwark, and one of Norfolk County Council, and it also seeks to include some distinguished Old Greshamians. The Clerk of the Fishmongers' Company also acts as Clerk to the Governing Body, and its meetings are held at Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London. The Grasshopper. The Grasshopper is used as the badge of several Gresham's School clubs, and a long-established school periodical is called ""The Grasshopper"". The green insect appears as the crest above the school's coat of arms, commemorating the Founder, Sir John Gresham, whose family crest it was. The Gresham Grasshopper is also used by Gresham College and can be seen as the weathervane on the Royal Exchange in the City of London, founded in 1565 by Gresham's nephew Sir Thomas Gresham, and the similar weathervane on the Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts, which is modelled on the Royal Exchange's. The first Royal Exchange was profusely decorated with grasshoppers. According to an ancient legend of the Greshams, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby in long grass in North Norfolk in the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. A beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply an heraldic rebus on the name Gresham, with ""gres"" being a Middle English form of ""grass"" (Old English grœs). In the system of English heraldry, the grasshopper is said to represent wisdom and nobility. Development and external relations. During the celebrations of the school's 450th year in 2005, the establishment was announced of a Foundation to focus on encouraging legacies and donations for scholarships, bursaries and specific major projects. A Director of Development and External Relations has since been appointed, as part of a programme of reaching out to Old Greshamians, and gatherings are planned around the UK and overseas. Archives. The Manuscripts Section of the Guildhall Library in the City of London holds the following Gresham's School records: The Norfolk Record Office also holds some Gresham's accessions, including a bundle of correspondence relating to the school from 1799 to 1810 between the Fishmongers' Company and Adey & Repton, including copies of statutes.

wikipedia-3913403," DirectDraw Surface  The DirectDraw Surface file format (uses the filename extension DDS), from Microsoft, is a standard for storing data compressed with the lossy S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) algorithm, which can be decompressed in hardware by GPUs and consoles like the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This makes the format useful for storing graphical textures and cubic environment maps as a data file, both compressed and uncompressed. The Microsoft Windows file extension for this data format is '.dds'. History. This format was introduced with DirectX 7.0. In DirectX 8.0, support for volume textures was added. Though it was originally designed for DirectX, it can also be used in OpenGL as well via the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) ARB texture compression extension. With Direct3D 10, the file format was extended to allow an array of textures to be included, as well as support for new Direct3D 10.x and 11 texture formats. "
wikipedia-3913453," Pinealoma  Pinealoma is a tumor of the pineal gland. Presentation. The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin which plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms. A pinealoma may disrupt production of this hormone, and insomnia may result. Frequently, paralysis of upward gaze along with several ocular findings such as convergence retraction nystagmus and eyelid retraction also known as Collier's sign and Light Near Dissociation (pupil accommodates but doesn't react to light) are known collectively as Parinaud's syndrome or Dorsal Mid-brain syndrome, are the only physical symptoms seen. This is caused by the compression of the vertical gaze center in the midbrain tectum at the level of the superior colliculus and cranial nerve III. Work-up usually includes Neuro-imaging as seen on the right. A pinealoma may cause interruption of hypothalamic inhibiting pathways, sometimes leading to beta-hCG secretion and consequent Leydig's cell stimulation. Other symptoms may include hydrocephalus, gait disturbances, and precocious puberty. Etiology. Pinealomas can be due to proliferation of primary pineocytes (pineocytomas, pineoblastomas), astrocytes (astrocytoma), or germ cells (germinoma). Germinomas are the most common tumor in the pineal gland. Prognosis. Of the different types of pinealomas, the type with the most favorable prognosis is the pineocytoma. "
wikipedia-3913469," Kurdish culture  Kurdish Culture (Kurdish:کولتووری كوردی (Kulturi Kurdi) or ""çand û toreya kurdî"") is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. Some aspects of Kurdish culture are close to that of other Iranian peoples; for example all of them celebrate Newroz as the new year day, which is celebrated on March 21. Music. Traditionally, there are three types of Kurdish Classical performers - storytellers (""çîrokbêj""), minstrels (""stranbêj"") and bards (""dengbêj""). There was no specific music related to the Kurdish princely courts, and instead, music performed in night gatherings (""şevbihêrk"") is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs and are epic in nature, such as the popular Lawik's which are heroic ballads recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes of the past like Saladin. ""Heyran""s are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love. ""Lawje"" is a form of religious music and ""Payizok""s are songs performed specifically in autumn.  Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (""dîlok/narînk""), erotic poetry and work songs are also popular. Kurdish folklore is a very rich one. Kurds have their own national attire. The women usually wear colored dresses.These dresses differe from area to another area. One can tell from which province or city a certain lady is by looking at her dress. As to the men, they have the ""shalûshepik"" or ""rengûchox"" a sort of baggy trousers ""shirwal"" with an upper shirt. Round the belt they tie a long piece of cloth. The men also use ""shashik"" or ""cemedanî"" with a ""claw"" on their heads. Kurds love to dance and they have hundreds of folk-dances.The music usually have speedy tacts and high tuned. They mostly use the ""zurna"" (kind of flute) and ""Dehol"" (drum"". While kurds also enjoy melancholic maqams or ballads that usually tells about events from the past. Many historians use these ballads as oral history passed through the generations. Dance. Kurdish dance is a group of traditional hand-holding dances similar to those from the Balkans, Lebanon, and to Iraq. It is a form of round dancing, with a single or a couple of figure dancers often added to the geometrical centre of dancing circle.  According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, Kurds sing and dance in all of their festivals, birthdays and marriage ceremonies. These folkloric dances are one of the main factors in distinguishing Kurds from neighbouring Muslim populations. Kurdish dance has various and numerous versions such as following:  Rug. Kurdish rugs and carpets do use medallion patterns; however, far more popular are the all-over floral, Mina Khani motifs and the ""jaff"" geometric patterns. The beauty of Kurdish designs are enriched by high-chroma blues, greens, saffrons as well as terracotta and burnt orange hues made richer still by the lusturous wool used. The traditional Kurdish Rug uses Kurdish symbols. It is possible to read the dreams, wishes and hopes of the rug maker from the sequence of symbols used. It is this signification and communication both individually and grouped into Kurdish rug making Kurdish people study how meaning is constructed and understood by talking with the rug maker. Religion. Before the spread of Islam in the 7th century AD, the majority of Kurds practised their indigenous religions, which today are referred to as Yazdanism. Yazidism and Yarsan, which may have stemmed from and eventually replaced those religions, are still practiced among the Kurds. Most Yazidis live in Iraqi Kurdistan, in the vicinity of Mosul and Sinjar. Yazidis are also found in Syria, Armenia, Turkey, and Germany. Their holy book is ""Mishefa Reş"" (The Black Book). The Yarsan, or Ahl-e Haqq, religion is practised in western Iran, primarily around Kermanshah. There were also many Kurds who practised Zoroastrianism. Before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, a large part of the Kurdish population practised Christianity. Kurdish Christians can still be found in small numbers, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish kingdom of Adiabene, together with a large number of its Kurdish citizens, converted to Judaism during the 1st century BC. ""Tanna’it"" Asenath Barzani, who lived in Mosul from 1590 to 1670 was among the very first Jewish women to carry an official title normally reserved for rabbinic scholars. In the 7th century, Arabs conquered the Kurdish regions and converted the majority of Kurds to Islam. The majority of Kurds today are Muslim, belonging to the Shafi school of Sunni Islam, distinguishing them in the region, (and to a much lesser degree, the Hanafi) Schools of Sunni Islam. There is also a significant minority of Kurds that are Shia Muslims, primarily living in the Ilam and Kermanshah provinces of Iran and Central Iraq (""Al-Fayliah"" Kurds). The Alevis are another religious minority among the Kurds, mainly found in Turkey. There are also Kurdish Agnostics.  Most Kurds have moderate tendencies toward religion. Folklore. Some better known traditional Kurdish ceremonies or festivals include:  Legendary characters include:  Cultural heritage. Kurdish cultural heritage is rooted in one of the world's oldest cultures. In parts of Arbil, Southern Syria and Western Iran, the Kurdish young men practice an old culture in which growing a mustache and beard at a young age to prove their loyalty as a man and respect to their elders. Over the past century, this culture has disappeared in most of the area. The Kurds were formerly considered sufficient to describe themselves as the descendants of the Carduchi, who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains in the 4th century BC. However, there is evidence of more ancient settlements in the region of Kurdistan. The earliest known evidence of a unified and distinct culture (and possibly, ethnicity) by people inhabiting the Kurdish mountains dates back to the Halaf culture of 6000 BC to 5400 BC. This was followed by the spread of the Ubaidian culture, which was a foreign introduction from Mesopotamia. In 1927, Ephraim Speiser discovered remains of ancient Halaf and Ubaid settlements in ""Tepe Gewre"" (Great Mound) 24 km northeast of Mosul. These settlements date back to between the 5th and 2nd millennium B.C., and include 24 levels of civilizations including Halaf and Ubaid. This site includes an acropolis with monumental remains and fine architecture. In their own histories, they are proud to mention the Hurrian period in the mid third millennium BC as the earliest well documented period. The 3rd millennium was the time of the Guti and Hattians. The 2nd and 1st millennium BC were the time of the Kassites, Mitanni, Mannai (Mannaeans), Urartu, and Mushku. All of these peoples shared a common identity and spoke one language or closely related languages or dialects. These groups are thought to have been non-Indo-Europeans, apart from the original Mitanni leadership. Kurds consider themselves to be Indo-European as well as descendants of the above groups. According to the Encyclopedia Kurdistanica, Kurds are the descendants of all those who have historically settled in Kurdistan, not of any one particular group. A people such as the Guti (Kurti), Mede, Mard, Carduchi(Gordyaei), Adiabene, Zila and Khaldi signify not ""the"" ancestor of the Kurds but only one ancestor. This heritage has been subject to injustices, neglect and repression, or has been eclipsed by other cultures. Important components of the original cultural heritage have disappeared or have been destroyed. There are numerous examples of how valuable or irreplaceable Kurdish physical heritage are endangered or destroyed, like the threat posed by the Illusi Dam in Turkey, where the oldest Kurdish city, Hasankeyf, soon is to be covered by water.

wikipedia-3913669," Coat of arms of the Isle of Man  The coat of arms of the Isle of Man dates from 12 July 1996. As the Isle of Man is a Crown dependency, the arms are more accurately described as The Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the Isle of Man. History. The Arms of Her Majesty in right of the Isle of Man were granted by Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann on 12 July 1996. The arms are an augmented form of the traditional arms. It has a threefold rotational symmetry. ""See"" Frieze group. The traditional arms date back to the 13th century. The arms are recorded in the English ""Walford's Roll"", and ""Camden Roll"", as well as the French ""Wijbergen Roll"". Within the ""Camden Roll"" the arms appear illustrated as: ""gules, three mailed legs embowed, and conjoined at the thighs, argent""; the original Norman French blazon reads: """"l'escu de gules, a treis iambes armes"""". Symbolism. Escutcheon. The escutcheon is emblazoned: ""Gules a triskele argent garnished and spurred Or"". The triskele (or triskelion) is an ancient symbol, consisting of three branches or legs, that radiate from a centre. The symbol is found on the flag Isle of Man, and earlier on that of Sicily. The Manx triskelion is known in the Manx language as ""Ny Tree Cassyn"" (""The Three Legs""). The symbol has been associated with the island since at least the 13th century. It is unknown how the Manx triskelion was originally adopted, and several theories have been put forward its origin. In 1607, English historian William Camden stated that it was derived from the Sicilian triskelion. In 1885 John Newton considered the Manx triskelion originated in the mid 13th century, when the Pope offered the throne of Sicily to Edmund, son of King Henry III of England. Newton noted that the wife of King Alexander III of Scotland was Henry's daughter, and that Alexander visited the English court in 1255. Later in 1266, Norway ceded the Isle of Man to the Kingdom of Scotland, and Newton considered it likely that Alexander utilised the triskelion for the arms of his new possession. It has also been suggested that the ancestry of the Manx triskelion can be traced to the triquetra in a coin of Olaf Cuaran, a 10th-century Norse-Gaelic warlord who was king of Northumbria and king of Dublin. Lending credibility to this theory is the current belief that the mediaeval Manx dynasty was related to that of Olaf Cuaran. However, the gap between the 10th century and late 13th century, when the Manx triskelion is first recorded, is wide indeed, and it has been noted that several kings from this period are known to have borne a galley as their emblem, and not a triskelion. Early examples of the symbol are present in the Royal Arms ascribed to the King of Mann in several late 13th century armorials. The Manx triskelion also appears on the Manx Sword of State, which is popularly said to date to the time of King Olaf the Black (d. 1237), although recent analysis has shown it more likely dates to about the 15th century. Another example can be seen on a 14th-century stone cross in the churchyard of Maughold. Another is example is a late 14th-century seal of Sir William le Scrope, Lord of Mann, in which the Manx triskelion is depicted in plate armour, rather than mail. Early representations of the Manx triskelion show the legs running clockwise, and later representations show the legs running in both directions. Supporters. The peregrine falcon is derived from the time of King John I of Mann. In 1405, he was granted the Isle of Man, on condition he paid homage to King Henry IV of England, and gave two peregrine falcons to him and every future English king their Coronation Day. The descendants of John I ruled the Isle of Man until King George III of England assumed the Lordship. The presentation of falcons continued on, until the coronation of King George IV of England, in 1822. In keeping with the Viking history of the island, the raven featured in Norse mythology. The chief god Odin was accompanied by the two ravens Huginn and Muninn. Motto. The motto is ""quocunque jeceris stabit"", which is Latin and means: ""whichever way you throw, it will stand"". The motto dates to the 17th century, where it is first recorded as being present on Manx coinage dating to the year 1668. It is possible that the motto became associated to the Manx triskelion through these coins. "

wikipedia-3913836," Nokia N80  The Nokia N80 is a multimedia 3G smartphone made by Nokia with support for high-speed UMTS/WCDMA connections. Features include a 3.1-megapixel camera (interpolated from 2.0-megapixels) with built-in flash (on the back of the device), another camera (on the front) for videoconferencing, Wi-Fi (802.11g), Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), FM radio, Bluetooth 1.2, digital music player functionality, MiniSD memory card slot, and support for 3D Java games. Because of its memory card and relatively large screen, it can function as a portable media player. It uses the third edition of the Series 60 user interface (S60v3) and the Symbian operating system version 9.1. It is ""not"" backward compatible with software compiled for earlier versions of the Symbian operating system. The N80 is Nokia's first UPnP-compatible phone, allowing the transfer of media files to compatible devices over Wi-Fi. Versions. Bluetooth. Nokia originally announced the N80 as supporting Bluetooth 2.0, however it was released with Bluetooth 1.2. Therefore the N80 does not currently support stereo playback over Bluetooth. Internet Edition. The Nokia N80 Internet Edition was a second version of this handset with the same hardware as the normal N80. It has been released in Q4 of 2006 and is available in Patina Bronze or Pearl Black, and has the following additional software included. As of January 2007, the Pearl Black model was available for sale in the US for $499. Nokia have now announced that the new Internet Edition firmware is available for the 'classic' N80 by using Nokia Official Software Updater, downloadable from Nokia.com. Before the Internet Edition firmware was made available on the Nokia Software Updater, end users could update the N80 to the same specification as an N80 Internet Edition by flashing the N80 with the firmware from the N80 Internet Edition. This required the use of several hacked Nokia servicing software applications, including the Phoenix Service Software (or Nokia Software Update with Nemesis (by changing product code)). This method is of questionable legality in some jurisdictions, and may violate the terms of the phone's warranty. There are reports of the occasional failure of this method due to user error or for other unknown reasons, leaving the phone in an unusable state from which only a properly-equipped service center could recover it.

It is located on the boundary of the West Midlands and Worcestershire counties between the towns of Dudley and Kidderminster. The parish had a population of 4,283 in 2001, but the whole village had a population of perhaps 5,600, including the part in Clent parish. It is in Bromsgrove District. The parish of Hagley used to consist of Top Hagley, Lower Hagley and Blakedown. The main focus of the village was Top Hagley where Hagley Hall and the parish church of St. John The Baptist (with its origins in Anglo-Saxon times) reside, but with the arrival of the railway in 1852 and the building of a ""proper"" station and its iconic GWR footbridge (finished in 1884), Lower Hagley started to expanded. With the expansion of Lower Hagley (now known as West Hagley) the focus of the village started to move. This was recognised in 1906 with the building of a subsidiary parish church in Lower Hagley dedicated to St. Saviour, and today West Hagley contains the shopping area and the schools. The precise dividing line between the two areas is undefined and is therefore debatable. Nevertheless, both settlements lie within the parish of Hagley. Hagley is part of the West Midlands Urban Area as defined by the Office for National Statistics, and is joined to Stourbridge and the Black Country by the A491 and B4187; The village lies at the foot of the Clent Hills, and is served by its own railway station on the Kidderminster to Birmingham line. It is situated on the A456 Birmingham to Kidderminster road, which is known as the Hagley Road in Birmingham, because it was once administered by a turnpike trust, whose responsibilities ended at the former boundary of the parish (now in Blakedown). Despite having a population larger than some market towns (such as Tenbury Wells) and once having its own cattle market, Hagley lacks the essential characteristics of a market town. While it has a shopping street and many local services, it is a fundamentally unbalanced community economically, in that there is little local employment (other than in local services). However, unemployment is low, because of the ease of commuting to work. Accordingly Hagley is essentially a dormitory village. The population of Hagley greatly increased after the arrival of the railway in 1862, which enabled people to commute into Birmingham or the adjacent Black Country. Landmarks. Hagley is known for Significant events. The parish register of Hagley is the oldest in England. It dates from 1 December 1538, being the year in which registers were ordered to be kept in all parishes. Three tragic events during the late 20th century drew media attention to Hagley. Murder of a student. In 1983, Susan Renhard from West Hagley, a student at Manchester Polytechnic, was murdered while taking photos in the Peak District. Her body was discovered showing indications that she had fought violently to defend herself before being strangled. The murder made national headlines and Norman Hugh Smith, a 17 year old computer student, was found guilty of the crime and described by the judge a ""very wicked man"". Susan's father, a retired law lecturer, became heavily involved in two charities that seek to help relatives who have lost loved ones through homicide. Child murder. In January 1988, Stuart Gough, a 14-year-old newspaper delivery boy was found murdered some 20 miles away near Worcester. Serial paedophile Victor Miller later admitted murdering Stuart and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge said that he didn't know whether it would be safe ever to release him. An article in the Daily Telegraph listed Miller as one of 35 murderers that the Home Secretary had recently recommended never to be released from prison. School minibus crash. In November 1993 a serious collision occurred on the M40 motorway near Warwick, approximately 30 miles from Hagley, resulting in the deaths of twelve pupils and a teacher. Only two girls survived the accident that made national headlines and caused moves for new legislation to improve safety and driving standards for school vehicles. "

wikipedia-3914289," Harold Fowler McCormick  Harold Fowler McCormick (May 2, 1872 — October 16, 1941) was an American businessman. He was chairman of the board of International Harvester Company and a member of the McCormick family. Biography. Harold was born on May 2, 1872 to inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick (1809—1884) and Nancy Fowler (1835—1923). In 1895 he married Edith Rockefeller (1872—1932), the youngest daughter of philanthropists John Davison Rockefeller (1839—1937) and Laura Celestia ""Cettie"" Rockefeller (1839—1915). Harold and Edith had five children (the eldest two died young) before divorcing in 1921. He became the third inaugural trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was also a trustee of the Rockefeller-created University of Chicago. As an officer of the Aero Club of Illinois, founded February 10, 1910, McCormick became the third president in 1912, following Octave Chanute and James E. Plew. In 1914, McCormick, Plew, and Bion J. Arnold attempted to form a commuter airline which they announced would begin service in May, ""using seaplanes to ferry passengers between various North Shore suburbs and Grant Park and the South Shore Country Club. Lake Shore Airline, which had two seaplanes, was intended to be a profit-making venture charging a steep twenty-eight-dollar round-trip fare between Lake Forest and downtown Chicago on four daily scheduled circuits. However, Chicago's irregular weather, especially the crosswinds, made a shamble of schedules, and the airline disappeared before the end of the year."" After his divorce from Edith, Harold married opera singer Ganna Walska. They divorced in 1931. During the transition period between these two women, McCormick sought to fortify himself by undergoing an operation by Serge Voronoff, a surgeon who specialized in transplanting animal glands into aging men with impotency. He resided at 1000 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Harold became chairman of the board of International Harvester Company in 1935, replacing his older brother Cyrus Jr. He died on October 16, 1941. Legacy. Orson Welles claimed that McCormick's lavish promotion of his second wife's opera career—despite her renown as a terrible singer—was a direct influence on the screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"", wherein the titular character does much the same for his second wife. (Samuel Insull, Thomas Edison's private secretary and later president of a utilities holding empire that included Commonwealth Edison, built the Chicago Civic Opera House (now the Lyric Opera) for his wife, Gladys Wallis, and was another influence, along with actresses Hope Hampton and Marion Davies.)

This group performs around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, especially around the holiday season, when they perform at various venues such as the Fort Worth Petroleum Club, Cooks Children's Hospital, HEBISD conferences, Santa USA, Noteboom Injury Lawyers, and many others. Along with the nearly 30 shows in December alone, Bell System has its annual Showtime performance located in the L.D. Bell auditorium. In 2010, the show choir was featured on the front page of the ""Fort Worth Star-Telegram"" prior to the show in February.  The choral program is continuously recognized throughout the region and country. The choirs often receive the Sweepstakes award at UIL competitions, as well as bring home awards from annual out-of-state competitions. In 2010, the A Cappella choir was named Grand Vocal Champions in The Windy City Classic in Chicago. In October 2009, the A Cappella choir was featured on KERA Television in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. By invitation, the choirs often perform with local orchestras and outside organizations such as the Northeast Tarrant County Orchestra. In March 2012, the choirs traveled to Italy, where they performed at St. Peter's Basilica. The program is expected to nearly double in participation in the next several years. Speech and debate. L.D. Bell also features a vibrant speech and debate program that was revitalized in 1995. The speech and debate organization at the school had been largely non-competitive since the early 1980s. The team has competed in Lincoln-Douglas debates and several speech events at competitions run by the Texas Forensics Association, National Forensics League, and UIL. Famous alumni.

wikipedia-3914787," Le Portrait de Petit Cossette  The series was adapted into a manga series by Asuka Katsura. It spanned two volumes and was published in 2004. The English-language release is published by Tokyopop. Plot. The series focuses on Eiri Kurahashi, a college art student who works in an antique shop. One day, he sees the image of a girl in an antique glass. To his shock, she appears to be moving and living out her life before his eyes. He becomes infatuated with the girl, and one night at midnight, he somehow makes contact with her. He learns that her name is Cossette, and that she was an aristocrat's daughter during the 18th century. She reveals to him that her spirit has been entrapped within the glass because the artist Marcello Orlando murdered her. She tells Eiri that, in order to set her free, a man must be willing to take upon himself punishment for the sins Marcello committed. As the series progresses, Eiri is tortured mentally and physically by Cossette, who demands that he prove his professed love for her. It is revealed that Eiri is the reincarnation of Marcello, and that Cossette is becoming as infatuated with him as he is with her. Also depicted are the efforts of the women in Eiri's life—relatives, friends, mentors, and the girl who secretly loves him—to free him from what is becoming apparent to them as a self-destructive path. Media. OVA. Sony Pictures Entertainment released the three Region 2 DVD compilations from May 26, 2004 to December 22, 2004. On December 1, 2004, the soundtrack to the OVA was released by Wint. It contained eighteen tracks by Yuki Kajiura, including the main theme music . Later released as a single on August 11, 2004, ""Hōseki"" is sung by Marina Inoue. During the period when Geneon Entertainment held the license, the episodes were aired on Fuse TV The anime has since been relicensed by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. The OVA was released on April 20, 2010 and streamed on the Anime Network a month later. ""Petit Cossette"" is also licensed in New Zealand and Australia by Madman Entertainment, and in German by Tokyopop. Manga. ""Le Portrait de Petit Cossette"" appeared as a serial in ""Monthly Magazine Z"". Kodansha collected the chapters into two ""tankōbon"" volume and published them from August 11, 2004, to December 21, 2004. Tokyopop licensed ""Le Portrait de Petit Cossette"" for an English-language release in North America and published the volumes from July 2006 to November 2006. However, both volumes are now out of print. The series is also licensed in France by Asuka Comics. Reception. ""Anime News Network""'s Theron Martin described it as ""an artsy, stylish supernatural horror story about love and obsession. Its dramatic visuals, exceptional artistry, and sumptuous musical scoring make watching it quite an experience, and the story isn't half bad, either."" However, he noted that the storyline of the first two episodes was ""fairly predictable"" and the secondary characters were ""underdeveloped and underused"". Reviewers at Mania Entertainment praised it as ""a love story that's almost devoid of happiness, with a style and presentation that makes it engrossing, and yet not exactly easy to watch"" and ""an easy recommendation for those looking for something more mature from their anime.""

wikipedia-3914792," Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project  Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project deals with a 2006 software branding dispute and its resolution, between the Mozilla Corporation and the Debian Project. The branding issue developed when Mike Connor, representing the Mozilla Corporation, requested that the Debian Project comply with Mozilla standards for use of the Thunderbird trademark when redistributing the Thunderbird software. At issue were modifications not approved by the Mozilla Foundation, when the name for the software remained the same. In 2006, the Debian Project subsequently rebranded the Mozilla Firefox program, and other software released by Mozilla, so that Debian could distribute modified software without being bound by the trademark requirements that the Mozilla Foundation had invoked. The new names established by Debian were Iceweasel for Mozilla Firefox, Icedove for Mozilla Thunderbird, and Iceape for SeaMonkey. These changes were implemented in the subsequent version of Debian (Etch). In July 2007, Iceowl, a rebranded version of Mozilla Sunbird, was added to the unstable branch of Debian. IceWeasel. History and origin of name. Mozilla Foundation owns the trademark “Firefox” and claims the right to deny the use of the name and other trademarks to unofficial builds. The Debian Free Software Guidelines are used by the Debian project to determine whether a license is a free license, which in turn is used to determine whether something can be included in Debian. As the logo did not meet these requirements, it could not be used by software which was to be included in Debian. This effect of the Mozilla trademark policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in 2004 and 2005. During this debate, the name “Iceweasel” was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox. The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode, in reply to Eric Dorland's suggestion of “Icerabbit”. It was intended as a parody of “Firefox”. “Iceweasel” was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy, and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox. By January 1, 2005, rebranding as a strategy was being referred to as the “Iceweasel route”. The term ""ice weasel"" appeared earlier in a line which Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche: """"Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."""" Debian was initially given permission to use the trademarks, and adopted the Firefox name. However, because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, the substituted logo had to remain. Trademark agreement revocation. In February 2006, Mike Connor, representing the Mozilla Corporation, wrote to the Debian bug tracker and informed the project that Mozilla did not consider the way in which Debian was using the Firefox name to be acceptable. Connor confirmed that the Mozilla Corporation was revoking the previous agreement which allowed Debian to use the Firefox name. Further messages from Mike Connor clarified Mozilla's new trademark policies: usage of the Firefox name is not allowed unless the rest of the branding is used and all of the browser's changes are approved by Mozilla Corporation. The immediate problem caused by the new policy was Debian's inability to use the official Firefox logo due to its proprietary license failing to comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Additionally, as Debian releases are frozen on a long-term basis, software in the frozen stable releases needs to be patched for any newly discovered security issue. Under the revised guidelines, in order to use the Firefox name, approval from the Mozilla Corporation would have been required for all security patches, but the Debian project felt it could not put its security in the hands of an external corporation in that manner. The ""Iceweasel"" name was revived in the Debian community as a possible name to give the rebranded version of Firefox. The Iceweasel found in Debian is not GNU IceWeasel (now GNU IceCat) but a rebranded Firefox created by the Debian project. The Debian maintainer has stated that he will ""get in touch with GNU IceCat/IceWeasel team to see what we can do together"". Similarly, Debian renamed Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to Icedove and Iceape, respectively. Rebranding. According to the ""Debian Package Tracking System"", Iceweasel, Icedove and Iceape were first accepted into the Debian project's ""unstable"" repository on November 20, 2006, on October 14, 2006, and on December 1, 2006, respectively. Icedove migrated to Etch and Thunderbird was removed on November 11, 2006. Iceape migrated to Etch on January 11, 2007, (the old Mozilla suite having previously been removed on October 6, 2006). Iceweasel migrated (and Firefox was removed) on January 18, 2007. Debian's first stable release to include Iceweasel, Icedove, and Iceape was Debian 4.0 (Etch), released April 8, 2007. Soon after the renaming Debian also replaced Mozilla's unbranded logos with new logos designed to fit with the new names, drawn by Ricardo Fernandez Fuentes. Subsequent products. Debian's IceWeasel, IceDove, IceOwl, and IceApe are respectively based on Mozilla's Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, and SeaMonkey. The rebranded products still use some Internet-based services from Mozilla, including the Mozilla plugin finder service, and Mozilla add-ons and their update notifications. There has also been no change to how non-free components, such as Flash, are found or used. IceDove. ""Icedove"" is an e-mail client distributed by the Debian project. It is based on Mozilla Thunderbird, but is made entirely of free software. With Icedove, the Debian project aims to provide a version of the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client which has not yet been kept in synchronization with upstream development of Thunderbird as originally planned. It removes the proprietary artwork and plug-in repositories used in the official release by the Mozilla Corporation, which are classified as non-free by free software advocates. IceApe. Iceape is a free software Internet suite based on SeaMonkey. It is developed by the Debian Mozilla Team in unison with the SeaMonkey Council's work on their release, but in accordance with Debian's policy of only using free content, copyrighted artwork and proprietary plug-ins are omitted. A temporary lack of community development support resulted in Iceape being absent from the repository for Debian 5 (""Lenny""), though the iceape-dev and iceape-dev-bin libraries remained available. Support later resumed with Debian 6 (""Squeeze""), and by early 2013, the package was available for both Squeeze and June's release of Debian 7 (""Wheezy""). IceOwl. Iceowl is a calendar application distributed by the Debian project. It is based on Mozilla Sunbird, but is made entirely of free software. Licensing. The rebranded programs are available under Mozilla's standard MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license. Like Mozilla, the default icons are under the same tri-license, but unlike Mozilla, there are no trademark restrictions. User agent problem. Some web sites do not recognise the browsers' User agent strings and refuse to work properly. As a workaround, Iceweasel 3.5.5 adds a ""like Firefox x.x.x"" string to the User-Agent. "
wikipedia-3973020," Ontario Mental Health Act  The Ontario Mental Health Act (OMHA) is an Ontario law which regulates the administration of Mental Health Care. The main purpose of the law is to regulate the involuntary admission of people into a psychiatric hospital. Since the changes brought about in 2000 under Bill 68 (often referred to as ""Brian's Law"", named after Brian Smith who was shot dead in 1995 by a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia), the act allows for a ""community treatment order"" by the attending physician. This order is intended to provide comprehensive treatment outside of a psychiatric facility. Assessment orders Form 1. The following are three common ways that a person may be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility in Ontario for a 72 hour observation period: Police bring person to physician. When a person is acting in a disorderly manner, the act allows the police to take someone already in custody to a designated psychiatric facility for examination by a physician if they believe that the person is an immediate danger to himself or herself, an immediate danger to others, or not able to care for himself or herself to an extent that physical impairment will result. The officer must also believe that the immediate nature of the threat precludes the use of section 16 (Bringing Information before a Justice of the Peace). Person lays information before Justice of Peace. In situations where there is no immediate danger, anyone can bring evidence to a justice of the peace that the person is a danger to himself or herself, a danger to others, or is not able to care for himself or herself. The judge can then order a person to be examined by a physician and fill out a Form 2 authorizing the police to take the person to a physician for examination. Physician orders assessment. Third, where a physician examines a person and has reasonable cause to believe that the person, and if in addition the physician is of the opinion that the person is apparently suffering from mental disorder of a nature or quality that likely will result in, the physician may make application in the prescribed form for a psychiatric assessment of the person. Or, where a physician examines a person and has reasonable cause to believe that the person, and if in addition the physician is of the opinion that the person, the physician may make application in the prescribed form for a psychiatric assessment of the person. The physician fills out a Form 1 authorizing the police to bring the person in for a psychiatric assessment. Involuntary admissions. Once a person has been brought to a psychiatric facility to be assessed, the physician may hold them there for up to 72 hours on an ""application for psychiatric assessment"" (Form 1). This form allows the person to be held at a psychiatric facility for assessment, but does not itself permit any treatment without the persons consent.  Consent to treatment is not covered under the ""Mental Health Act"" but rather the ""Health Care Consent Act"". The physician must also fill out a Form 42 to notify the person and inform them of why they're being held. At the end of the 72 hours permitted by a Form 1, the person must either be released, be admitted as a voluntary patient, or continue to be held as an involuntary patient with a ""certificate of involuntary admission"" (Form 3).  The physician who signs the Form 3 must be different than the physician who signed the initial Form 1.  A Form 3 allows the patient to be held for two weeks and the patient must be notified with a Form 30.  At the end of the two weeks, if the facility is to continue to keep the patient on an involuntary basis, a ""certificate of renewal"" (Form 4) must be filled out. The first time a Form 4 is filled out, it is valid for one month, the second time it is filled out it is valid for two months, each time after that, it is valid for three months. Each time a Form 4 is filled out, another Form 30 must be filled out, notifying the patient. Rights of the patient. A physician who places a person on a Form 3 or Form 4 is required to notify a ""rights adviser"" who is required to meet with the patient and explain to the patient what his or her rights are. If the patient requests it, a rights adviser will also help the patient apply for an appeal or acquire legal services.  If a patient is placed on a Form 3 or Form 4, they have the right to appeal the decision to a ""Consent and Capacity Board"" which will hear the patient's and physician's case. A patient's involuntary status is reviewed by the Board every year whether the patient requests it or not.  The board is composed, at the minimum, of a lawyer, a psychiatrist, and a member of the community (often a family member of someone with mental illness). If the patient or physician disagrees with the Board's decision, they may appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Community treatment orders. The OMHA states that ""the purpose of a community treatment order is to provide a person who suffers from a serious mental disorder with a comprehensive plan of community-based treatment or care and supervision that is less restrictive than being detained in a psychiatric facility. ... to provide such a plan for a person who, as a result of his or her serious mental disorder, experiences this pattern: The person is admitted to a psychiatric facility where his or her condition is usually stabilized; after being released from the facility, the person often stops the treatment or care and supervision; the person’s condition changes and, as a result, the person must be re-admitted to a psychiatric facility.""  When a physician decides that a patient meets the criteria for a community treatment order, a treatment plan is developed with the involvement of all people involved in the plan. In addition to the physician and the patient, people involved in the plan may include other health care workers, social workers, family members, the substitute decision maker, or others. Once the treatment plan is agreed to by all parties, the patient is required to follow the plan while living in the community. Failing to follow the plan can result in the person being readmitted to the hospital on a Form 47. One notable aspect of the community treatment orders is that it allows anyone who is named in the treatment plan to communicate with each other for the purpose of providing treatment, care, or supervision of the person. By removing barriers to communication between members of the health care team, appropriate interventions can be quickly applied when the person is at risk. A community treatment order lasts six months and can be renewed if needed. A person on a community treatment order has the right to see a rights advisor and to appeal to the Consent and Capacity Board. The Board will review community treatment order every year whether the patient requests it or not. "
wikipedia-3973031," Corneal ulcers in animals  A corneal ulcer, or ulcerative keratitis, is an inflammatory condition of the cornea involving loss of its outer layer. It is very common in dogs and is sometimes seen in cats. In veterinary medicine, the term ""corneal ulcer"" is a generic name for any condition involving the loss of the outer layer of the cornea, and as such is used to describe conditions with both inflammatory and traumatic causes. Corneal anatomy of the dog and cat. The cornea is a transparent structure that is part of the outer layer of the eye. It refracts light and protects the contents of the eye. The cornea is about one-half to one millimeter thick in the dog and cat. The trigeminal nerve supplies the cornea via the long ciliary nerves. There are pain receptors in the outer layers and pressure receptors deeper.  Transparency is achieved through a lack of blood vessels, pigmentation, and keratin, and through the organization of the collagen fibers. The collagen fibers cross the full diameter of the cornea in a strictly parallel fashion and allow 99 percent of the light to pass through without scattering. There are four important layers in the dog and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of the thickness of the cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor. Corneal healing. An ulcer of the cornea heals by two methods: migration of surrounding epithelial cells followed by mitosis (dividing) of the cells, and introduction of blood vessels from the conjunctiva. Superficial small ulcers heal rapidly by the first method. However, larger or deeper ulcers often require the presence of blood vessels to supply inflammatory cells. White blood cells and fibroblasts produce granulation tissue and then scar tissue, effectively healing the cornea. Superficial and deep corneal ulcers. Corneal ulcers are one of the most common eye diseases in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). There have been at least two cases where corneal ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus. Superficial ulcers involve a loss of part of the epithelium. Deep ulcers extend into or through the stroma and can result in severe scarring and corneal perforation. Descemetoceles occur when the ulcer extends through the stroma, exposing Descemet's membrane. This type of ulcer is especially dangerous and can result in perforation. The location of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, dry eye, or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Ulcers in the inferior nasal cornea may be caused by foreign material trapped under the third eyelid. Entropion or distichiae may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and sclera. Symptoms. Corneal ulcers are painful due to nerve exposure, and can cause tearing, squinting, and pawing at the eye. There may also be signs of anterior uveitis, such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye. An axon reflex may be responsible for uveitis formation — stimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine. Diagnosis. Diagnosis is through direct observation of the ulcer with the use of fluorescein stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green. With descemetoceles, Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis. Treatment. Treatment of corneal ulcers includes topical antibiotic therapy to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Atropine may decrease tear production and interfere with corneal healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal in less than a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require corneal suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse. Bioscaffold. A new bioscaffold developed by TR BioSurgical is being evaluated for refractory corneal ulcers in dogs. The study is being conducted by board certified veterinary ophthalmologists and has shown promise in healing refractory ulcers that have failed conventional treatment . Refractory corneal ulcers. Refractory corneal ulcers are superficial ulcers that heal poorly and tend to recur. They are also known as indolent ulcers or Boxer ulcers. They are believed to be caused by a defect in the basement membrane and a lack of hemidesmosomal attachments. They are recognized by undermined epithelium that surrounds the ulcer and easily peels back. Refractory corneal ulcers are most commonly seen in middle aged or older dogs and often occur in the other eye later. They are similar to Cogan's cystic dystrophy in humans. Treatment. Refractory corneal ulcers can take a long time to heal, sometimes months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine. Melting ulcers. Melting ulcers are a type of corneal ulcer involving progressive loss of stroma in a dissolving fashion. This is most commonly seen in ""Pseudomonas"" infection, but it can be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi. These infectious agents produce proteases and collagenases which break down the corneal stroma. Complete loss of the stroma can occur within 24 hours. Treatment includes antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors such as acetylcysteine and homologous blood serum. Surgery may be necessary. Corneal ulcers in cats. Corneal ulcers in cats can be caused by trauma, detergent burns, infections, and other eye diseases. One common cause not seen in dogs is infection with feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1). FHV-1 causes ulceration by direct infection of the epithelial cells. Lesions appear as round or dendritic (branching) ulcers. FHV-1 also suppresses healing of the cornea. Symptoms include conjunctivitis, squinting, eye discharge, and blood vessels on the cornea. It can cause severe scarring. Treatment is with topical antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and oral L-lysine, which competes with arginine and inhibits viral replication. Corneal ulcers in horses. Corneal ulceration is a very common disease of the equine eye and can have sight-threatening consequences. Aggressive treatment is always indicated, as even apparently mild ulcers can progress quickly, causing serious complications. Causes. A distinct cause for initial ulceration is not commonly found, although in many cases it can be assumed to be traumatic in origin. The horse's eye is especially vulnerable to trauma due to its prominent position, compared with other species. Exposure keratitis (inflamed cornea) can occur in the horse, most commonly secondary to facial nerve paralysis. Hospitalised animals have been shown to have a decreased corneal reflex, and this corresponds to an increased incidence of ulcers in the hospitalised population. Foreign bodies embedded in the palpebral conjunctiva or the nictitating membrane can cause persistent irritation and ulceration. Often the shape and distribution of the lesion is suggestive of this aetiology, but even in the absence of a characteristic lesion their presence should be considered and sought out. Bacterial and fungal infection occurs readily after the initial ulceration, as disruption of the corneal epithelium allows attachment and colonisation of the underlying tissues by normal corneal commensals. Commonly isolated bacteria include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and empirical anti-microbial therapy should be effective against these bacteria. Diagnosis. Differential diagnoses for the painful equine eye: A full ocular exam should be performed for every case of eye pain. Fluoroscein staining is usually diagnostic for corneal ulcers, although staining with Rose Bengal is also recommended as it can pick up early viral/fungal lesions, which will appear as multifocal disturbances to the tear film. Culture and sensitivity is recommended for rapidly progressive or deep corneal ulcers. Cotton swabbing is often inadequate, and corneal scraping, for example, with the blunt side of a scalpel blade is usually required. This can be greatly facilitated by the use of local nerve blocks and topical anaesthesia. There is almost invariably a secondary uveitis present with corneal ulceration, and signs of this may also be seen: miosis, corneal oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes. Treatment. Medical therapy should be based upon the severity of disease initially, and then by the response to therapy. The aims of the initial therapy are: The initial choice of antibiotic depends upon personal choice, experience and availability, but could include chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and tobramycin. Topical gentamicin formulations are also available, but in the opinion of some, should be reserved for cases with stromal melting. Frequency of application can vary from q1h to q8h, depending on both the severity of the lesion, and the formulation used (ointment vs. drops). Much of the pain associated with corneal ulceration is due to the secondary uveitis and miosis, and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to mydriasis. Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. Mydriasis is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with uveitis, such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1 mg/kg, BID. Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time. In horses that are difficult to treat, or in cases that require very frequent treatment, then placement of a sub-palpebral lavage system can be very useful. As an adjunct to therapy, physical protection of the eye may be required, in the form of a mask. Some horses will rub their eyes in response to pain, and this can cause further corneal damage. Box rest is also vital, as over-exertion has been linked to intra-ocular haemorrhage and increased severity of uveitis. Success in your therapeutic regime can be judged by a reduction in pain, and a decrease in size of the ulcer. Healing generally occurs rapidly at first, followed by a slowing after 5–7 days. As a rough guide, a non-infected ulcer can be expected to heal at approximately 0.6mm/day. Complications. In cases where the ulcer is not healing: Melting ulcers reflect inappropriate collagenolysis of the corneal stroma, by matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). Bacterial pathogens (especially Pseudomonas and β-haemolytic Streptococcus) induce the corneal epithelial cells and resident leucocytes to upregulate pro-inflammatory, and MMP-activating cytokines (IL-1,-6 and -8). These bacteria can also produce their own proteinases. The combination of exogenous, and upregulated endogenous, proteinases leads to a rapid breakdown of collagen, with the characteristic melting appearance. Untreated this can lead to perforation within 12 hours (so act hard and fast!). There are several therapeutic options for inhibiting MMPs: A combination of the above may be necessary early in the disease course. Effective antibiosis is also paramount, and gentamicin is a good empirical choice (although there are some reports of gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas species). Obviously, treating an eye this frequently in practice will be difficult, so referral is probably the best option. "
wikipedia-3973082," Cabin cruiser  A cabin cruiser is a type of power boat that provides accommodation for its crew and passengers inside the structure of the craft. A cabin cruiser usually ranges in size from in length, with larger pleasure craft usually considered yachts. Many cabin cruisers can be recovered and towed with a trailer and thus easily stored on land, which reduces maintenance and expense. These craft are generally equipped with a head (toilet), a galley, and at least one berth. Most cabin cruisers usually have a small dining area and some have an aft cabin (a cabin to the rear of the cockpit, with a double bed) Some cabin cruisers are equipped with heating, air conditioning, and power generators. Most also have water heaters and shore power electric systems. The cabin cruiser provides many of the amenities of larger yachts, while costing much less and normally being fully operable by the owner, whereas larger yachts often require a professional crew. Most newer cabin cruisers are faster than older models because of improved aerodynamic and hydrodynamic designs. Cabin cruisers are generally able to handle the water well because of their size and give a stable ride. They are generally spacious in the cockpit (open seating area towards at aft or centre). In the UK, purpose-built cabin cruisers were popular on the canal network in the 1960s and 1970s. Leading manufacturers were Norman, Viking, Microplus, and Dawncraft. Today, they are more commonly found on the navigable rivers rather than canals. "
wikipedia-3973093," Oasis discography  The discography of English rock band Oasis consists of seven studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums, six video albums, one extended play, twenty-nine singles, nineteen promotional singles and thirty-six music videos. The band have sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide and have also been cited by ""Guinness World Records"" as the most successful act in the United Kingdom between the years 1995 and 2005. Oasis was formed in 1991 by vocalist Liam Gallagher, guitarist Paul ""Bonehead"" Arthurs, bassist Paul ""Guigsy"" McGuigan and drummer Tony McCarroll – they were later joined guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher. The band signed to Creation Records in May 1993 and released their debut single ""Supersonic"" the following year; it peaked at number 31 in the United Kingdom. Follow-up singles ""Shakermaker"" and ""Live Forever"" became UK top 15 hits, with the latter also attaining success in the United States. ""Definitely Maybe"", the band's debut studio album, topped the UK Albums Chart and went on to be certified seven times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Oasis released their second studio album ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"" in October 1995. It was a huge commercial success, topping the charts in the UK and in multiple other countries, including Australia, Canada and Ireland. The album produced six singles, including the band's first UK number-one single ""Some Might Say"" and the international hits ""Wonderwall"" and ""Don't Look Back in Anger"". ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"" has sold over twenty-two million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling albums of all-time. The album was certified fourteen times platinum by the BPI and is the fifth biggest-selling album in the UK, with sales of over 4.5 million copies in the country. The band's third studio album ""Be Here Now"" was released to great anticipation in August 1997. While the album topped the charts in several countries and became the fastest-selling album in British history, it failed to match the commercial success of ""Morning Glory"". Two of the album's singles, ""D'You Know What I Mean?"" and ""All Around the World"", peaked at number one in the UK. Oasis' fourth studio album ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" was released in February 2000, reaching number one in the UK and Ireland. Though not as commercially successful as its predecessors, ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" managed to receive a double platinum certification from the BPI and featured three UK top five singles: ""Go Let It Out"", ""Who Feels Love?"" and ""Sunday Morning Call"". ""Heathen Chemistry"" followed in July 2002, becoming Oasis' fifth consecutive number-one album in the UK and being certified triple platinum by the BPI. ""Don't Believe the Truth"", released in May 2005, topped the UK Albums Chart and produced the number-one singles ""Lyla"" and ""The Importance of Being Idle"". In November 2006, the band released a compilation album, ""Stop the Clocks"", which peaked at number two in the UK and was preceded by the release of an EP of the same name. Oasis released their seventh studio album ""Dig Out Your Soul"" in October 2008; it continued the band's streak of number-one studio albums in the UK and was certified double platinum by the BPI by the end of the year. Following the release of ""Dig Out Your Soul"" and Noel Gallagher's departure from the band in August 2009, Oasis announced their break-up. In June 2010, a retrospective compilation album of the band's singles entitled ""Time Flies... 1994–2009"" was released, peaking at number one in the UK. "
wikipedia-3973096," Saturn Relay  The Saturn Relay was the first and only minivan from the Saturn brand of American automaker General Motors. It was introduced for the 2005 model year, and was built alongside its sisters, the Buick Terraza, the Chevrolet Uplander, and the Pontiac Montana SV6 in Doraville, Georgia. The Relay was the first Saturn vehicle without polymer side paneling, and is also the first Saturn that is a rebadged Chevrolet or Pontiac. The Relay was introduced with a 3.5 L LX9 V6 that generates and torque, going from 0-60 mph in the 9-second range seconds. For 2006, a 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option, which delivered faster acceleration and better response than the 3.5L engine. For 2007, the 3.5 L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9 L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9 L engine. Also in 2007, the Relay received an optional flex-fuel engine but only for fleet applications. The Relay scored three ""Good""s (the highest possible score) and two ""acceptable""s (the second highest possible score) in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests. In terms of gas mileage, the Relay is rated at city, highway. The Relay started at US$22,850. There were three available trim levels, ""2FWD"", ""3FWD"", and ""3AWD"". All Relays seat seven via folding/removable 2nd row captains chairs and a 50/50 third-row bench. The third-row bench folds flat but did not fold entirely into the floor. OnStar assistance and a DVD rear entertainment system came standard on all Relays. A navigation system was optional on Relay 3s. Front side airbags were standard on 3s and optional for the 2. Second-row side airbags were optional on all models. Changes. 2006. 2006 models added the GM badges on the doors. 2007. The final model year of the Relay. The Saturn badging was dropped from the doors & the all-wheel drive option disappeared. The Relay was discontinued in 2007 and the Doraville, Georgia assembly plant closed in September 2008. The last Relay rolled off the line on November 17, 2006. The Relay was replaced by the 8-passenger, Lambda-based Outlook crossover SUV. "
wikipedia-3973131," Hypermobility  Hypermobility describes joints that stretch farther than normal. For example, some hypermobile people can bend their thumbs backwards to their wrists, bend their knee joints backwards, put their leg behind the head or perform other contortionist ""tricks"". It can affect a single joint or multiple joints throughout the body. Causes. Hypermobility generally results from one or more of the following: These abnormalities cause abnormal stress on a joint or many joints, meaning that the joints can wear out, leading to osteoarthritis. The condition tends to run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic basis for at least some forms of hypermobility. The term ""double jointed"" is often used to describe hypermobility; however, the name is a misnomer and should not be taken literally, as an individual with hypermobility in a joint does not actually have two separate joints where others would have just one. Most people have hypermobility with no other symptoms. In fact, approximately 5% of the healthy population have hypermobile joints. However, people with ""joint hypermobility syndrome"" may experience many difficulties. For example, their joints may be easily injured, be more prone to complete dislocation due to the weakly stabilized joint and they may develop problems from muscle fatigue (as muscles must work harder to compensate for the excessive weakness in the ligaments that support the joints). Hypermobility syndrome can also lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases. Instrumentalists with hypermobile fingers may have difficulties when fingers collapse into the finger locking position. Hypermobility may also be symptomatic of a serious medical condition, such as Stickler Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, lupus, polio, Down syndrome, morquio syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis or myotonia congenita. In addition, hypermobility has been associated with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Just as people with hypermobility have a higher risk for Osteoarthritis, they may also have a higher risk for Fibromyalgia. Some speculate that those with Fibromyalgia might have some form of Connective Tissue Disorder, such as the ones that cause hypermobility. Hypermobility causes physical trauma (In the form of Joint Dislocations, Joint Subluxations, Joint Instability, Sprains, etc), in turn causes emotional trauma; physical trauma, emotional trauma, and a few other factors either trigger and/or are possible causes for Fibromyalgia.  During pregnancy certain hormones alter the physiology of ligaments making them able to stretch to accommodate the birthing process. For some women with hypermobility pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain can be debilitating due to these two converging factors, and prohibits them from standing up or walking. Use of a bedpan and wheelchair may be necessary, or even permanent in some cases due to hip stretching. Also many people complain about joints or muscles hurting because of this. Symptoms of hypermobility include a dull but intense pain around the knee and ankle joints and the soles of the feet. The condition affecting these parts can be alleviated by using insoles in the footwear that have been specially made for the individual after assessment by an orthopaedic surgeon and orthotist. Anxiety and joint hypermobility. In 1998, a study was done concerning the link between panic disorder with joint hypermobility. The prevalence of joint hypermobility syndrome among patients with panic disorder was 67.7% compared to the control psychiatric group (10.1%). Women and subjects who were younger were found to be over 20 times more likely to have the hypermobile joints than their counterparts in the control group. In the study, there was also a higher prevalence for mitral valve prolapse (8%). The study does not determine whether hypermobility is associated in any way with psychiatric dysfunction or dysautonomia; many factors could explain the relation, and hypermobility's unwelcome gift of chronic pain may very well cause many people anxiety or depression. These people feel alone in that nobody understands their disorder and they find it difficult to explain to skeptics because their body looks perfectly normal. Often accused of not getting enough rest these patients become agitated that their previous life activities become increasingly difficult as their condition worsens. Lashing out, anxiety, depression, and sadness are all common  Hypermobility syndrome. Hypermobility syndrome is generally considered to comprise hypermobility together with other symptoms, such as myalgia and arthralgia. It is relatively common among children and affects more females than males. Causes. Current thinking suggests that there are four factors: These four factors affect different people to varying degrees. Hypermobility can also be caused by Connective Tissue Disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Joint Hypermobility is a common symptom for both of these. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome has numerous types; however, most types have hypermobility in some degree. When hypermobility is the main symptom, to where it overshadows the rest, then it most likely is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - The Hypermobility Type (EDS-HT). People with EDS-HT suffer frequent joint dislocations and subluxations (partial/incomplete dislocations), with or without trauma, and sometimes spontaneously. Commonly, the hypermobility is assumed by medical professionals to be nonpainful, mild, and dismissed in general. Consequently, they receive little to no treatment and left to suffer debilitating pain by many health professionals. They are labeled hypochondriacs, lazy, and/or as if the pain were a figment of their imagination. Symptoms. People with hypermobility syndrome may develop other conditions caused by their unstable joints. These conditions include: Diagnosis. Joint hypermobility syndrome needs to be distinguished from other disorders that share many common features, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta. In the last couple of years, collaborations of experts in connective tissue disorders formally agreed that there was little distinction between severe forms of Hypermobility Syndrome and mild forms Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type, and that they are in fact the same disorder. Information on this can be found in an article titled ""The lack of clinical distinction between the hypermobility type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and the joint hypermobility syndrome (a.k.a. hypermobility syndrome)"" Generalized hypermobility is a common feature in all these hereditary connective tissue disorders and many features overlap, but often distinguishing features are present that enable differentiating these disorders. The inheritance pattern of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies by type. The arthrochalasia, classic, hypermobility, and vascular forms of the disorder usually have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new (sporadic) gene mutations. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. The dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and some cases of the classic and hypermobility forms, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Beighton's criteria. As of July 2000, hypermobility is diagnosed using the Beighton criteria. The Beighton criteria do not replace the Beighton score but instead use the previous criteria in conjunction with other symptoms. HMS is diagnosed in the presence of either two major criteria, one major and two minor criteria, or four minor criteria. The criteria are as follows: Beighton score. The Beighton score is an edited version of the Carter & Wilkinson scoring system which has been used for many years as an indicator of widespread hyper-mobility. However medical professionals varied in their interpretations of the results; some accepting as low as 1/9 and some 4/9 as a diagnosis of HMS. Therefore it was incorporated, with clearer guidelines, into the Beighton Criteria. The Beighton score is measured by adding 1 point for each of the following: Treatments. Physical therapy. It is important that the individual with hypermobility remain extremely fit - even more so than the average individual - to prevent recurrent injuries. Regular exercise and physical therapy or hydrotherapy can reduce symptoms of hypermobility because strong muscles increase joint stability. These treatments can also help by stretching tight, overused muscles and ensuring the person uses joints within the ideal ranges of motion, avoiding hyperextension or hyperflexion. Low-impact exercise such as Pilates or T'ai chi is usually recommended for hypermobile people as it is less likely to cause injury than high-impact exercise or contact sports. Moist hot packs can relieve the pain of aching joints and muscles. For some patients, ice packs also help to relieve pain. Medication. Medications frequently used to reduce pain and inflammation caused by hypermobility include analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs (though these have been linked with an increase in pain and joint instability for some sufferers), and tricyclic antidepressants. Some people with hypermobility may benefit from other medications such as steroid injections or gabapentin, a drug originally used for treating epilepsy. Tramadol, a non-narcotic yet opioid pain reliever that is nearly as effective as narcotics, has been used in England to treat HMS joint pain, and it is available either by prescription from a doctor in the United States or from Mexico. Benzodiazapines are also used in HMS sufferers who experience painful muscles spasms around loose joints. Lifestyle modification. For some people with hypermobility, lifestyle changes decrease the severity of symptoms. For example: References. Grahame R.

wikipedia-3973178," Districts of Sri Lanka  In Sri Lanka, districts (, ) are the second-level administrative divisions, and are included in a province. There are 25 districts organized into 9 provinces. Each district is administered under a District Secretary, who is appointed by the central government. The main tasks of the District Secretariat involve coordinating communications and activities of the central government and Divisional Secretariats. The District Secretariat is also responsible for implementing and monitoring development projects at the district level and assisting lower-level subdivisions in their activities, as well as revenue collection and coordination of elections in the district. A district is divided into a number of Divisional Secretary Divisions (commonly known as DS divisions), which are in turn subdivided into Grama Niladari Divisions. There are 256 DS divisions in the country. History. The country was first divided into several administrative units during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The kingdom was divided into three provinces; ""Rajarata"", ""Ruhuna"" and ""Malaya Rata"". These were further subdivided into smaller units called ""rata"". Over time, the number of provinces increased, but the second-level administrative division continued to be the ""rata"". However, with the country eventually being divided into more than one kingdom and with foreign colonial missions landing and taking parts of the country under their control, this structure began to change. The territory of the Kotte Kingdom was organized into four ""disavas"", which were further subdivided into forty ""korales"". The ""korales"" had their own civil and military officials with a small militia. The Jaffna kingdom appears to have had a similar administrative structure to this with four provinces. When the Portuguese took over parts of the country after their arrival in 1505, they maintained more or less the same administrative structure followed by Sri Lankan rulers. During the Dutch rule in the country, the terrain under their control was divided into three administrative divisions. These were subdivided into ""disavas"" as in earlier systems. The British initially continued this system, but following reforms in 1796 to 1802, the country was divided according to ethnic composition. This was abolished by the Colebrook–Cameron reforms in 1833 and a legislative council was created, making the island a politically and administratively single unit. Five provinces were created, later expanded into nine, and these were subdivided into twenty-one districts. These districts were administered by officials known as Government Agents or Assistant Government Agents. In 1955, the district replaced the province as the country's main administrative unit. The Ampara district was created in 1958, followed by the creation of Mullaitivu and Gampaha districts in 1978 through a new constitution, which also reintroduced the province as the main administrative unit. The last district to be created was Kilinochchi in 1983, and the current constitution (that of 1978) states that the territory of Sri Lanka consists of 25 administrative districts. These districts may be subdivided or amalgamated by a resolution of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Districts. All population data are from the most recent census of Sri Lanka, in 2001. The districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi were not covered in this census because of security reasons, and Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Mannar were only partially covered. Therefore, the population statistics for these districts are estimates. These are marked by a * symbol. "
wikipedia-3973197," Poʻouli  The Poouli or Black-faced Honeycreeper (""Melamprosops phaeosoma"") is a critically endangered and possibly extinct bird species that is endemic to Hawaiʻi. It is considered to be a member of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, and is the only member of its genus Melamprosops. Poouli are brown above, greyish-white below, with broad black mask extending behind eye. Adults are silvery-grey above mask, shading into brown of crown, with bold, pale patch just behind mask. Juveniles are similar but buffier below with smaller mask and without grey above. Most earlier published images of the Poouli were of the juvenile plumage. Discovery, taxonomy and behavior. The Poouli was not discovered until 1973 by students from the University of Hawaiʻi, who found the bird on the north-eastern slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui. It was found during the Hana Rainforest Project at an altitude of above sea level. The Poouli was the first species of Hawaiian Honeycreeper to be discovered since 1923. It is dissimilar to other Hawaiian birds. Evidence based on DNA suggests it belongs to an ancient lineage of honeycreepers. It appears to have out-lived all its close relatives; that is if it had any close relatives. No other bird - living or fossil - has a structure similar to it. It feeds mostly on snails, insects, and spiders and nests in native ‘ōhi‘a lehua (""Metrosideros polymorpha"") forests. Status. In the past, according to fossil records, it seems that the bird lived on the dry half of the island of Maui, across southwestern slope of Halekala at altitudes of . 100–200 Poouli were estimated to exist when the species was first discovered. There were only 76 birds per km². By 1981, there were only 15 birds per km². By 1985, there were only 8 per km². That meant that from the year 1975, when it was first discovered, to 1985, only ten years later, the population had dropped by over 90 percent. In the 1980s, the Poouli disappeared from the easternmost part of its range and was now only found in the western branch of the Hanawi Stream.  To preserve the Poouli and other endangered fauna and flora, the State of Hawaii established the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve. This connected several protected areas to make one larger protective area. This protection effort was only possible due to the work of several groups: the government, Maui County, the National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and several private companies. The land was fenced off and by June 1996 they began to clear out the pigs from the closed areas. Four years and 202 pigs later, the Poouli pen was completely cleared of pigs. As more pigs were removed from the other two pens, population of native species that lived there, e.g. the Maui Parrotbill and ʻAkohekohe, rose slightly faster than they otherwise would have. Rats, cats, and goats were still being removed from the Poouli pen. By 1997, only three individuals were known to exist. These had home ranges within the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and the adjacent Haleakala National Park. In 2002, one of these, a female, was captured and taken to a male's home range in an attempt to get them to breed. The female, however, had flown back to her own territory, which was away, by the next day. There was also a ten-day expedition in 2004. The goal of this was to capture all three birds and bring them to a bird conservation center on the island, in the hope they would produce offspring. On September 9, 2004, one of the remaining birds, a male, was captured and taken to the Maui Bird Conservation Center in Olinda, in an attempt to captively breed the bird. However, biologists could not find a mate for the male before it died on November 26, 2004. Tissue samples have been taken from the male for possible future cloning, but as neither birds of the opposite sex are now available nor natural behavior can be imprinted on possible cloned individuals, this does not seem probable. As such efforts would likely compete with conservation funding of extant bird species, it may not even be desirable as a cloning attempt would both be highly likely to fail and at the same time jeopardize the survival of other highly threatened species. If the two remaining birds still survive, they are at least ten years of age, nearing the end of their life, and probably have not been fertile for a few years. It is uncertain whether they are a male and female, or both are of the same sex. Since 2004, extensive surveys have failed to locate these or other individuals of this species and it could be extinct, but remains listed as Critically Endangered by BirdLife International (and thereby IUCN) until additional surveys have confirmed its extinction beyond reasonable doubt. The dramatic population decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including habitat loss, mosquito-borne diseases, predation by pigs, rats, cats, and Small Asian Mongooses, and a decline in the native tree snails that the Poouli relies on for food. Popular culture. The Poouli bird is referenced in a lounge inspired number less elegy than celebratory memorialization, Poouli, appearing on John Zorn's album O'o (another extinct endemic bird species of Hawai'i Nei) along with a number of other Hawai'iana tracks and bird songs of species illustrated on the albums cover. The personnel on the sessions compose a New York underground supergroup, consisting of Mark Ribot, Trevor Dunn, among others. "
wikipedia-3973229," American-180  The American-180 is a submachine gun developed in the 1960s which fires .22 LR cartridges from a pan magazine. The concept began with the Casull Model 290 that used a flat pan magazine similar to designs widely used prior to World War II. Only 80 Casull M290s were built and the weapon was expensive to produce. The American-180 is an improved version. A semi-automatic only variant called the American SAR 180/275 is still produced on a custom basis by E&L Manufacturing of Riddle, Oregon. Operation. The weapon operates through a conventional blowback mechanism. It uses an open bolt with a flat pan magazine. It fires at a relatively high rate of fire of around 1,200 RPM. The American-180 was purchased mostly by private parties prior to the American ban on production of machine guns for the US civilian market. The A180 was adopted by the Utah Department of Corrections to arm prison guards. Despite the relatively low power of the .22 LR round, testing demonstrated that automatic fire could penetrate even concrete and bulletproof vests from cumulative damage. However, the target would have to remain still for an improbable amount of time to allow the cumulative damage to amass in the same area to achieve this. "

In a 2004 interview with Gelb, ""The Guardian"" wrote ""Gelb's way of dealing with it was to treat Giant Sand (not to be confused with his 1970s electro-rock band Giant Sandworms) as a loose, uncompetitive, mutually supportive musical collective, a place for friends to hang out and play.

In a 2006 interview, Gelb said """"Sno Angel"" is now the name of this project. Like you had Arizona Amp, OP8 and all those other ones. So the way I regulate them is to keep them with their own flavour, and if this takes on a life of its own...which this may well do...it will make time for itself.

wikipedia-3973438," High-altitude nuclear explosion  High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANE) have historically been nuclear explosions which take place above altitudes of 30 km, still inside the Earth's atmosphere. Such explosions have been tests of nuclear weapons, used to determine the effects of the blast and radiation in the exoatmospheric environment. The highest was at an altitude of 540 km (335.5 mi). The only nations to detonate nuclear weapons in outer space are the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. program began in 1958 with the ""Hardtack Teak"" and ""Hardtack Orange"" shots, both 3.8 megatons. These warheads were initially carried on Redstone rockets. Later tests were delivered by Thor missiles for Operation Dominic I tests, and modified Lockheed X-17 missiles for the Argus tests. The purpose of the shots was to determine both feasibility of nuclear weapons as an anti-ballistic missile defense, as well as a means to defeat satellites and manned orbiting vehicles in space. High-altitude nuclear blasts produce significantly different effects. In the lower reaches of vacuous space, the resulting fireball grows much larger and faster than it does near the ground, and the radiation it emits travels much farther. EMP generation. The strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that results has several components. In the first few tens of nanoseconds, about a tenth of a percent of the weapon yield appears as powerful gamma rays with energies of one to three mega-electron volts (MeV, a unit of energy). The gamma rays penetrate the atmosphere and collide with air molecules, depositing their energy to produce huge quantities of positive ions and recoil electrons (also known as Compton electrons). The impacts create MeV-energy Compton electrons that then accelerate and spiral along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The resulting transient electric fields and currents that arise generate electromagnetic emissions in the radio frequency range of 15 to 250 megahertz (MHz, or one million cycles per second). This high-altitude EMP occurs between 30 and 50 kilometers (18 and 31 miles) above the Earth's surface. The potential as an anti-satellite weapon became apparent in August 1958 during ""Hardtack Teak"". The EMP observed at the Apia Observatory at Samoa was four times more powerful than any created by solar storms, while in July 1962 the ""Starfish Prime"" test damaged electronics in Honolulu and New Zealand (approximately 1,300 kilometers away), fused 300 street lights on Oahu (Hawaii), set off about 100 burglar alarms, and caused the failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai, which cut off the sturdy telephone system from the other Hawaiian islands. The radius for an effective satellite kill for the various prompt radiations produced by such a nuclear weapon in space was determined to be roughly 80 km. Further testing to this end was carried out, and embodied in a Department of Defense program, ""Program 437"". Drawbacks. There are problems with nuclear weapons carried over to testing and deployment scenarios, however. Because of the very large radius associated with nuclear events, it was nearly impossible to prevent indiscriminate damage to other satellites, including one's own satellites. ""Starfish Prime"" produced an artificial radiation belt in space which soon destroyed three satellites (Ariel, TRAAC, and Transit 4B all failed after traversing the radiation belt, while Cosmos V, Injun I and Telstar 1 suffered minor degradation, due to some radiation damage to solar cells, etc.). The radiation dose rate was at least 60 rads/day at four months after ""Starfish"" for a well-shielded satellite or manned capsule in a polar circular earth orbit, which caused NASA concern with regard to its manned space exploration programs. Differences from atmospheric tests. In general, nuclear effects in space (or very high altitudes) have a qualitatively different display. While an atmospheric nuclear explosion has a characteristic mushroom-shaped cloud, high-altitude and space explosions tend to manifest a spherical 'cloud,' reminiscent of other space-based explosions until distorted by Earth's magnetic field, and the charged particles resulting from the blast can cross hemispheres to create an auroral display which has led documentary maker Peter Kuran to characterize these detonations as 'the rainbow bombs'. The visual effects of a high-altitude or space-based explosion may last longer than atmospheric tests, sometimes in excess of 30 minutes. Heat from the ""Bluegill Triple Prime"" shot, at an altitude of 50 kilometers (31 mi), was felt by personnel on the ground at Johnston Atoll, and this test caused retina burns to two personnel at ground zero who were not wearing their safety goggles. Soviet high-altitude tests. The Soviets detonated four high-altitude tests in 1961 and three in 1962. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, both the US and the USSR detonated several high-altitude nuclear explosions as a form of saber-rattling. The Soviet tests were meant to demonstrate their anti-ballistic missile defenses which would supposedly protect their major cities in the event of a nuclear war. The worst effects of a Soviet high-altitude test occurred on 22 October 1962, in ‘Operation K’ (ABM System A proof tests) when a 300 kt missile-warhead detonated near Dzhezkazgan at 290-km altitude. The EMP fused 570 km of overhead telephone line with a measured current of 2,500 A, started a fire that burned down the Karaganda power plant, and shut down 1,000-km of shallow-buried power cables between Aqmola and Almaty. The Partial Test Ban Treaty was passed the following year, ending atmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear tests. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 banned the stationing and use of nuclear weapons in space.

wikipedia-3973454," Linn LM-1  The LM-1 Drum Computer, manufactured by Linn Electronics Inc., was the first drum machine to use digital samples of acoustic drums. Conceived and designed by Roger Linn, it was also one of the first programmable drum machines. It was introduced in early 1980 at a list price of US$4,995, climbed to $5,500 when additional features were incorporated, fell to $4,995 as cost-cutting measures were introduced, and later reduced to $3,995 before it was discontinued after the release of its successor, the LinnDrum. It is prized by amateur and professional musicians alike for its rarity as well as its characteristic sounds, which can be heard on the recordings of such famous artists as Prince, Michael Jackson, The Human League, Peter Gabriel, Kraftwerk and countless other pop hits of the 1980s. History. Roger Linn was a semi-professional guitarist in California in 1978 when he began to develop the LM-1 as an accompaniment tool for his home studio. He had experimented with many of the preset rhythm boxes which were popular at the time, but was dissatisfied and ""wanted a drum machine that did more than play preset samba patterns and didn't sound like crickets."" [http://www.synthmuseum.com/linn/index.html] Having learned how to program in BASIC and assembly language, Linn set to work on a computer program which could play user-programmed rhythm patterns, as well as chain them together to form a song. According to Linn, the first to suggest the idea of digital samples was Steve Porcaro of Toto. Linn himself doesn't remember exactly who played the sounds used for the samples; it has been suggested that they were a combination of several Los Angeles session drummers, possibly James Gadson, Art Wood, Ron Tutt, or Steve's brother Jeff Porcaro, also of Toto. Linn achieved his sounds by using a chip, built into the machine, which converted the digital samples into analog audio. His first prototype, manufactured some time during 1979, was a cardboard box which contained the electronic components of the drum machine. Supposedly, Linn brought this prototype to parties and jobs and marketed it to fellow musicians, including Peter Gabriel, the members of Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie Wonder, who bought one of the first units ever produced. In total, approximately 725 units were built and sold between 1980 and 1983, when the LM-1's successor, the LinnDrum, was released. The first 35 units were assembled in Linn's home, before manufacturing and distribution was taken over by 360 Systems, run by Bob Easton. The first 10 of these 35 units have somewhat unique characteristics, as described below. Features. The LM-1's many features set it apart from other drum machines of its time, most of which could only play a limited selection of preset rhythms (i.e. Roland CompuRhythm CR-78). One of its most prominent features was its programmability. Although the Linn LM-1 was not the first programmable drum machine (the PAiA Programmable Drum Set was released 6 years earlier), it was the first to use digital samples and gained widespread popularity among professionals. The LM-1 also introduced a shuffle feature that enabled users to program swing notes into their rhythms. Although this feature has often been imitated, the Linn shuffle has widely been recognized as the best and most natural-sounding, and is present on every device Linn designed, including the Akai MPC series. The LM-1 included a built-in 13-channel mixer (one channel for each sound) as well as individual output jacks. This enabled Linn's machine to integrate with existing recording equipment in a way that had previously not been possible for a drum machine. Unlike the later Linndrum, the LM-1 also had individual tuning pots for each voice, resulting in many famous users expressing their preference for the LM-1 long after the Linndrum was introduced. Unlike its younger brother, the LM-1 lacked crash and ride cymbal sounds (which producers easily compensated for by having live cymbals overdubbed onto whatever track was being recorded) and the drum sounds could not be triggered by MIDI or trigger inputs. Nevertheless, the LM-1's sounds are very punchy and prominent. There are notable differences between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of shuffle LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued because they were too expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as nice as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously. In the Rev.1 LM-1s, the first 10 have no serial numbers or pre-printed, adhesive-backed manufacturer's label on the rear panel, have a single molded metal frame for the front, bottom, and rear panels, have higher quality mixer pots, have two knobs for tempo control (coarse and fine; the fine control actually may have been intended for a rotary switch to program the shuffle setting), and are screen printed ""Linn and Moffett Electronics"" instead of ""Linn Electronics"" on the lower right front of the chassis beneath the drum buttons (Moffett was an early investor in the Linn drum computer development). There are other minor mechanical differences, too. The Rev. 2 LM-1 introduced two rows of LEDs to indicate the shuffle and quantize settings, several additional buttons on the front panel to aid in programming, and a shared filter on the toms and congas, as well as the kick drum. There were a handful of Rev. 2 LM-1's with both engraved buttons and shuffle LEDs but these are extremely rare. Cost-cutting measures were introduced to later Rev. 2's such as removing the engraved buttons and adding the drum names to the front panel, removing the sync input jack and sync output knob from the back of the machine (the current quantize setting became the default sync output rate), removing the low volume stereo outputs, decreasing the size of the play/stop button, and replacing the raised buttons with sealed buttons (flush with the surface) that were impossible to clean. In fact, the LM-1 service notes indicated these buttons had to be replaced if they went bad. Influence. Because of the Linn LM-1's versatility, it superseded its intended purpose as an accompaniment tool and became a fully-fledged rhythm section for many synthpop and progressive acts. Along with the Roland TR-808, which was released around the same time, it is widely credited with legitimizing drum machines which, with a few notable exceptions, had previously largely been considered toys by most professional, mainstream musicians. It was thought for a time that the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of business, and caused enough of a stir that many leading session drummers (such as Jeff Porcaro of Toto, for example) went out and purchased their own drum machines and offered ""programming"" services (Porcaro used an LM-1 on George Benson's 1982 hit ""Turn Your Love Around""). The first song featuring an LM-1 to hit #1 on the UK pop chart was the Human League's ""Don't You Want Me"", in late 1981. It is also the first LM-1 track to top the US Billboard Hot 100, spending four weeks there in July 1982. Rose Royce's ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" released on November 11, 1978 made heavy use of the LM-1 and made the top US 40. In some ways the most important and lasting of the LM-1's various features is its sounds, which remain powerful and characteristic and a familiar staple of 1980s pop music. Linn acknowledged that his lack of audio engineering know-how may have contributed to his drum machine's unique sound - many of the samples contain playback frequencies above the Nyquist frequency which, although it results in aliasing under normal circumstances, contributes much to the ""sizzle"" of the LM-1's sound. [http://www.synthmuseum.com/linn/linlm101.html] Linn introduced the successor to his revolutionary machine in 1982. The LinnDrum often erroneously called the LM-2 (LM-1 stood for Linn/Moffett/1 and Moffett wasn't with the company by the time the LinnDrum came around), contained more sounds (including cymbals), more options for programming sounds (step programming mode), and 5 programmable trigger inputs, but was a step back from the LM-1 in that it removed the ability to tune all of the individual drum sounds (hi-hat, bass, cowbell, tambourine, sidestick, and many other sounds were no longer tunable). It retailed for $2,500 less than the original LM-1 and although it added some additional features, the cost-cutting measures were quite notable. Although the LinnDrum helped make electronic drums more affordable for the common musician, they are still not as revered as the LM-1 and generally can be found on the used market for much less. In 2013 the Linneapolis VST was released with emulation of the Linn LM-1 complete with Prince sounds. "
wikipedia-3973461," Coniferyl alcohol  Coniferyl alcohol is an organic compound. This colourless crystalline solid is a phytochemical, one of the monolignols. It is synthethized via the phenylpropanoid biochemical pathway. When copolymerized with related aromatic compounds, coniferyl alcohol forms lignin or lignans. Coniferin is a glucoside of coniferyl alcohol. Coniferyl alcohol is an intermediate in biosynthesis of eugenol and of stilbenoids and coumarin. Gum benzoin contains significant amount of coniferyl alcohol and its esters. It is found in both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.

wikipedia-3973527," Skyshield  Skyshield is a short range air defence system developed by the Swiss corporation Oerlikon Contraves.  __NOTOC__ Air-defence system. Skyshield Air-defence system is a modular, light weight, Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) system developed by the Swiss corporation Oerlikon Contraves (now a subsidiary of Rheinmetall of Germany). The successor to the Skyguard defense system, Skyshield is intended to rapidly acquire and destroy threatening aircraft and missiles.  The weapons system itself consists of two 35 mm (1.38 inch) Revolver Cannons with a rate of fire of 1,000 rounds per minute, a Fire Control System made up of a sensor unit and a detached command post. The Skyshield can also use up to two surface-to-air missile 8-cell modules for an expanded air defense capability. The Skyshield is designed for traditional anti-aircraft roles in addition to defense against missiles (see Anti-ballistic missile). The Skyshield is easily deployed by trucks and other transportation systems. The fire control system (FCS) uses an X-band search and tracking radar, and another unit for radar/TV and/or Laser/FLIR precision tracking. The command post can be placed up to 500 meters, roughly, from the fire control unit (FCU), using encrypted radio-waves. The Skyshield system can also be networked with other air defense systems for wider and more effective air coverage, expanding its roles from point defense to area defense. A modified and improved version of Skyshield with six fully automated turrets, dubbed MANTIS (Modular, Automatic and Network capable Targeting and Interception System) has been ordered by the German Army as a stationary base defence system. Two systems will be delivered between 2011 and 2012, with more orders being planned as a part of German Army's future ""SysFla"" air defence program. "
wikipedia-3973592," Eastern Virginia Medical School  Eastern Virginia Medical School commonly referred to as EVMS, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States is a public-private medical school founded by grassroots efforts in the southeastern part of Virginia known as Hampton Roads. Unlike the other public medical schools in Virginia, EVMS is not affiliated with an undergraduate institution and coordinates training through multiple medical centers in the Hampton Roads region. The school is dedicated solely to graduate biomedical and health education. The EVMS campus includes the 555-bed Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, the region's only tertiary level 1 trauma medical care facility, and the 212-bed Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters, a regional pediatric referral care facility and only stand alone children's hospital in the state. EVMS is the first institution in the US to have produced a viable fetus through in vitro fertilization. EVMS is most known for its reproductive medicine, simulation/standardized-patient education as well as research in pediatrics, geriatrics, diabetes, and cancer. In addition, EVMS is well known for it's leadership in community service and medical missions, as evidenced by faculty and alumni responsible for the founding of Operation Smile, Physicians for Peace, Global Brigades, and CONRAD. Approximately 5,000 applicants apply to the EVMS MD program every year for a total class size of 150. As a result, the EVMS MD program has an admission rate of 3% making it extremely competitive. The class size of the MD class of 2012 is 146 with 51% of the class as in-state and 49% as out-of-state. Following its commitment to train Hampton Roads residents, 21% of the entering class originated from Hampton Roads. On January 10, 2013, it was announced that Harry Lester was to step down as president and would be succeeded by the school's dean and provost, Richard V. Homan, MD effective April 15, 2013. Homan currently serves jointly as the school's president, dean of the medical school and provost. Eastern Virginia Medical School's MD Program is currently ranked 44th in Best Medical Schools: Primary Care by US News & World Report. Its Physician Assistant Program is ranked 25th in the nation. History. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson remarked that Norfolk would be an ideal location for a medical school branch of his alma mater, The College of William & Mary, albeit for its less than desirable climate. He wrote “No sir, Richmond is no place to furnish subjects for clinical lectures. I have always had Norfolk in view for this purpose. The climate and Pontine country around Norfolk render it truly sickly in itself.” However, this early conception would not come to fruition. In the 1960s the metropolitan area of Southeastern Virginia known as Hampton Roads recognized that the region did not have enough physicians to support its growing population. In an attempt to close the gap, area leaders decided to found a regional medical school, to both attract physicians from outside areas and to produce ""home-grown"" practitioners. It was thought that a University medical center operating in conjunction with previously operating regional health care facilities would effectively end the shortage and more importantly, bring a bevy of experts and specialists to the area. The idea gained the support of the Virginia General Assembly and the city councils of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk and Virginia Beach. In 1964, the General Assembly authorized the formation of what was then known as the Norfolk Area Medical Center Authority.  In 1970 fundraising by the EVMS foundation began the collection of funds for the creation of EVMS. Before acceptance of its first class, more than $17 million had been donated from community and business leaders. In 1973, Eastern Virginia Medical School accepted its first class. The following year, the EVMS Office of Graduate Medical Education was established to coordinate residency and fellowship training programs. EVMS has since graduated its 30th class of physicians, with one in four of all local physicians having some connection to the University and, additionally has produced many other medical professionals to satisfy the ever-growing need for health care workers. In the spring of 2008, the Commonwealth of Virginia approved appropriating capital outlay funds to EVMS to allow it to increase its doctoral student enrollment by 30% and its physician assistant program by 60%. When this expansion is completed, the total student enrollment will rise to approximately 1,000. Throughout its history, the merger of the school with nearby Old Dominion University or The College of William and Mary has been raised but never carried out. Both of these universities had joint programs with EVMS throughout its history. In 2007 EVMS and ODU created a formal cooperation agreement to share resources strategically in hopes of attracting strong faculty and obtaining grants. However, on July 25, 2012, EVMS made a joint announcement with The College of William & Mary that the two schools are considering merging so that EVMS would become the William & Mary School of Medicine. Any such merger would have to be confirmed by the two schools and then confirmed by the Virginia General Assembly and the Governor. A pilot relationship, supported by $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, was subsequently agreed upon by both universities to examine this possible union in reality. Campus. Eastern Virginia Medical Campus Eastern Virginia Medical School is located in Norfolk, VA, near downtown and the historic neighborhood of Ghent. The school is part of the Eastern Virginia Medical Center, which also includes the afformentioned hospitals and affiliated satellite buildings, along with a ""Medical Tower,"" that has many private practice medical offices. The Center is bounded by Colley Avenue, Brambleton Avenue, Hampton Boulevard, and Redgate Avenue. The Tide light-rail system connects the campus with downtown Norfolk and points east to the Virginia Beach city line. The campus facilities include: Auxiliary Campus Sites Although students and residents primarily rotate through the Eastern Virginia Medical Campus facilities, they will occasionally be positioned in one of the many affiliated or community hospitals. These institutions are listed below.  Academics. Eastern Virginia Medical School offers a wide variety of medical programs including: Graduate medical education. Fully accredited residencies at EVMS include: Fully accredited fellowships at EVMS include: -Adult Fellowships- -Pediatric Fellowships- Major research centers. The George L. Wright Jr. Proteomics Lab, a leader in the field, is now housed within this new center for cancer research. The center also includes a Biorepository that collects, processes and stores biological specimens and associated data. The Biorepository currently has 70,000 human samples available. The center is named in honor of Norfolk lawyer, community leader and philanthropist Leroy T. ""Buddy"" Canoles Jr. One of only a handful in the country that integrates task trainers, computerized manikins, virtual interfaces and standardized patients (people trained to portray patients) to create more realistic training scenarios. The new center incorporates the preexisting Theresa A. Thomas Professional Skills Teaching and Assessment Center, which helped pioneer the use of standardized patient education. In addition, a 3-D Virtual Reality lab known as ""The Cave"" is under construction. This system allows physicians and those in training to simulate real-life medical and physiological situations in an interactive/immersive, computer-based arena. As a Division of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Jones Institute, CONRAD is one of the campuses leading research organizations. The group recently was awarded a $100 million grant for work on Microbicides, which are products in development that will eventually come in a variety of forms (such as topical gels, creams, tablets, films and pills) to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and potentially other sexually transmitted infections. As described above, the Jones Institute was the first American body to perform In Vitro Fertilization. It continues today to further reproductive and endocrine research. As a leader in research for Diabetes, the Strelitz Diabetes Center has made several important findings. Dr Aaron Vinik, one of the leading researchers in the field, discovered the importance of INGAP gene, which plays a role on pancreatic insulin cell regeneration.  Staffed by several EVMS physicians and scientists, this organization strives to educate health professionals in the discipline of sleep medicine, seeking to improve the quality of life and health of patients who suffer from sleep-related disorders. Several sleep-labs scattered throughout the region allow practitioners to evaluate, treat and research these afflictions. Established in 2012 with a $3 million gift from Macon and Joan Brock, founders of Dollar Tree Inc., the institute serves as a center for interdisciplinary collaboration for both community and global health outreach. It will bring experts, faculty and students together to further the mission of the school and that is to be the most community oriented medical school in the nation. Karen Remley, MD, MBA, the former Virginia Health Commissioner, will serve as the founding director of the institute starting on March 18, 2013. Governance. As EVMS has a unique public/private structure unlike most schools in Virginia, the structure of the Board of Visitors is also unique.  As part of the 2008 Virginia General Assembly session, a compromise was reached in order to include EVMS in Governor Tim Kaine's $1.43 Billion bond to finance renovation and construction at Virginia's universities, state colleges, and government facilities. In the compromise, EVMS would allow seven of its Board of Visitors to be appointed by the Governor, House, and Senate of Virginia in order to meet the definition of a public university which some state legislators did not believe EVMS currently fit. Local health initiatives. The vision of Eastern Virginia Medical School has been plainly stated to be ""recognized as the most community-oriented medical school in the nation."" This is largely a product of the school's founding principles and origins; fostered by way of cooperation between the individual localities of Hampton Roads, the ultimate goal was to have more ""home-grown"" physicians. It is also echoed in the school's mission statement and numerous community activities, outreach programs and educational opportunities.  A completely free clinic housed within the Norfolk Public Health Building, the HOPES clinic is staffed entirely by volunteer students, resident-physicians and local clinicians. The H.O.P.E.S. Started in early 2011 by several EVMS students, it the first free clinic of its kind in the state, and the only one in Norfolk offering free services. All costs associated with the clinic are covered through private donations from local businesses, organizations, individuals and students. A locally run system of winter shelters for the homeless, EVMS students and resident-physicians have long helped staff the shelters of this organization. The physicians-in-training often set up health screenings during this time, helping assess for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension within these homeless populations. Those screened are then oft referred to local free or reduced-fee clinics for treatment. Beyond Clinic Walls (BCW) pairs interdisciplinary student teams with older adults facing complex medical and social challenges. Student teams make home visits every two weeks to their assigned client for the duration of the academic year. Student teams work collaboratively, with each team member contributing their discipline’s unique insight, to help clients maintain their independence and quality of life. BCW provides the organizational structure, resources, and continuity of care to foster and support the development of rich and meaningful relationships between student volunteers and older adults. Sightsavers is a nonprofit organization devoted to restore the sight of blind people, provide medical care to prevent blindness, and promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. The very active chapter at EVMS provides glaucoma screenings frequently throughout the community. Global health initiatives. In addition to being very involved in the local healthcare of Hampton Roads, EVMS has a longstanding commitment to global health education. The school offers many different opportunities for students to engage in community service abroad. Individuals who are pursuing a degree in public health are given the opportunity to do their research thesis abroad in several locations. The purpose of the projects is to give the individual students a unique perspective on how to do public health research projects in developing countries. The MPH department at EVMS has two established locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru. The research and service projects serves to help provide healthcare to the communities that have developed in areas where few services exist. Students and faculty from all health professions embark annually on medical missions to Peru, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mission is to bring medication and healthcare services to various rural communities. In partnership with local organizations with EVMS roots, students can also participate in medical missions with Operation Smile and Physicians for Peace. The Global Health Coalition is an umbrella organization dedicated to increasing awareness, knowledge and interest in international health through strategic coordination of global health related student organizations and activities at EVMS. GHC sponsors events and speakers on a number of international health topics, and facilitates the participation of EVMS students in international health internships and activities. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) is an independent not-for-profit organization helping to lead the improvement of health care throughout the world. The IHI is a reliable source of energy, knowledge, and support for a never-ending campaign to improve health care worldwide. Founded in 1991 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, IHI works to accelerate improvement by building the will for change, cultivating promising concepts for improving patient care, and helping health care systems put those ideas into action. The group aims to improve the lives of patients, the health of communities, and the joy of the health care workforce by focusing on an ambitious set of goals adapted from the Institute of Medicine's six improvement aims for the health care system: Safety, Effectiveness, Patient-Centeredness, Timeliness, Efficiency, and Equity. Community service organizations. In addition to serving the community with several medically oriented groups, EVMS students and faculty are very active in general service. EVMS students began collecting new and used coats through Coats for Kids—formerly Operation Overcoat—in 1987. Coats for Kids distributes thousands of coats each year to the area's needy children. WAVY-TV is media sponsor of Coats for Kids. Albano Cleaners dry clean all the donated coats and distribute them among the distribution sites. EVMS is a drop off site as well as a distribution site. Three times each winter the EVMS students volunteer and give out coats to those who need them. As part of the community oriented tradition at EVMS, students get together to redesign Lewis Hall into a Haunted Hallway for the neighborhood children. Families from the surrounding neighborhoods are shuttled in and can enjoy an array of games, crafts and haunted mazes. The intent is to provide a safe and open space for children and their families to spend the night Trick or Treating. Student organizations and interest groups. The AMA-MSS is dedicated to representing medical students, improving medical education, developing leadership, and promoting activism for the health of America. The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), with more than a half-century history of medical student activism, is the oldest and largest independent association of physicians-in-training in the United States. Founded in 1950, AMSA is a student-governed, non-profit organization committed to representing the concerns of physicians-in-training. AMSA began under the auspices of the American Medical Association (AMA) to provide medical students a chance to participate in organized medicine. Starting in 1960, the association refocused its energies on the problems of the medically underserved, inequities in our health-care system and related issues in medical education. Since 1968, AMSA has been a fully independent student organization. With approximately 50,000 members, including medical and premedical students, residents and practicing physicians, AMSA is committed to improving medical training as well as advancing the profession of medicine. AMSA focuses on four strategic priorities, including universal healthcare, disparities in medicine, diversity in medicine and transforming the culture of medical education. Today, AMSA continues its commitment to improving medical training and the nation's health. This student group was formed to bring together students and provide a safe and open space at EVMS to discuss LGBT issues, especially topics related to health care. Each year, the group does presentations for the other medical interest groups to help bring LGBT awareness to other students as they pursue their medical school training. Student traditions. Every year during the fall semester, the first and second year medical school classes get together to play a game of football where the female students compete and male students are on the sidelines cheering. Games are refereed by the third and fourth medical school classes, which always makes each year's game interesting. Traditionally, the second year students beat the first years. Several Fridays throughout the year, EVMS will fund a social outing providing food and often entertainment for the students, residents and faculty at either a local restaurant or on school grounds. A tradition dating back to the school's early years, this tradition is designed to help promote collegiality and provide stress relief throughout the difficult times of medical education. The tradition initially involved alcoholic beverages, however these were removed when they were no longer allowed on campus. To mark the official entrance into the medical community and the beginning of a medical student's education, each first year medical and physician assistant student is ""coated"" by an attending physician of EVMS. The ceremony usually ends with the reciting of the Hippocratic Oath. To signify the transition of the short white coat of the medical student to that of the full-length coat of the physician, the original short coats are burned in a ceremony similar to that of an American Flag being retired from service. This tradition began as an informal, student-run activity, simply referred to as the ""White Coat Burning."" However, in 2010, the Office of Alumni Relations formalized and expanded the celebration as a means to welcome the graduating class into the Alumni Association. The ceremony won the 2011 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Award of Excellence for being a ""new take on an old tradition"".' Just as the rest of the nation's medical school students find out what residency program they are to join, EVMS celebrates its ""Match Day"" on the third Friday of March (previously third Thursday of March). However, unique to EVMS is a long-standing tradition of dressing up in costume based on a varying yearly theme. Examples of past themes have included ""Plan B,"" ""Heroes and Villains,"" and ""Rock Stars."" Economic impact. In a 2007 study conducted by Old Dominion University, EVMS was found to not only be important for the region's physical health, but also among the greatest economic influences on the region. The study found the following: Notable faculty and graduates. Faculty Graduates "

wikipedia-3973669," Plastic bending  Plastic bending is a nonlinear behaviour peculiar to members made of ductile materials that frequently achieve much greater ultimate bending strength than indicated by a linear elastic bending analysis. In both the plastic and elastic bending analyses of a straight beam, it is assumed that the strain distribution is linear about the neutral axis (plane sections remain plane). In an elastic analysis this assumption leads to a linear stress distribution but in a plastic analysis the resulting stress distribution is nonlinear and is dependent on the beam’s material. The limiting plastic bending strength formula_1 (see Plastic moment)can generally be thought of as an upper limit to a beam’s load–carrying capability as it only represents the strength at a particular cross–section and not the load–carrying capability of the overall beam. A beam may fail due to global or local instability before formula_1 is reached at any point on its length. Therefore, beams should also be checked for local buckling, local crippling, and global lateral–torsional buckling modes of failure. Note that the deflections necessary to develop the stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently to the point of incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations. Plastic bending occurs when an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a cross-section to exceed the material's yield strength. Loaded with only a moment, the peak bending stresses occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section. The cross-section will not yield simultaneously through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the neutral axis is the same as the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section). After a structural member reaches a sufficiently high condition of plastic bending, it acts as a Plastic hinge. Elementary Elastic Bending theory requires that bending stress varies linearly with distance from the neutral axis, but plastic bending shows a more accurate and complex stress distribution. The yielded areas of the cross-section will vary somewhere between the yield and ultimate strength of the material. In the elastic region of the cross-section, the stress distribution varies linearly from the neutral axis to the beginning of the yielded area. Predicted failure occurs when the stress distribution approximates the material's stress-strain curve. The largest value being that of the ultimate strength. Not every area of the cross-section will have exceeded the yield strength.  As in the basic Elastic Bending theory, the moment at any section is equal to an area integral of bending stress across the cross-section. From this and the above additional assumptions, predictions of deflections and failure strength are made. Plastic theory was validated at the beginning of the last century by C. v. Bach. See also.

wikipedia-3973724," Digimon Data Squad  Digimon Data Squad, known in Japan as , is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation (who worked on the Sunbow Productions animated series based on Hasbro properties), serving as the fifth series in the ""Digimon"" franchise, the first to be produced in four years following 2002's ""Digimon Frontier"". The series aired in Japan on Fuji TV between April 2, 2006 and March 25, 2007. An English-language version was produced by Studiopolis in conjunction with Toei Animation USA and Disney Enterprises and aired in North America on Jetix (and subsequently Disney XD) between October 1, 2007 and November 1, 2008. It aired in the United Kingdom on Kix!. A movie based on the series was released in Japan on December 9, 2006. The series was later succeeded by ""Digimon Fusion"". Production. Digimon Savers was first announced during the December of 2005 Jump Festa convention in Japan with advertisements showing a remolded Agumon as the lead Digimon. The name of the series was later revealed in January 2005 with the character designs coming a month later. Savers was the first Digimon series to be produced in nearly four years, but the second Digimon production since 2005, coming off the heels of Digital Monster X-Evolution, where staff had mentioned early on that a new series might be possible depending on its performance. Unlike previous series which all featured human character designs by Akihiro Asanuma, Savers went with designs by Sayo Aoi that featured designs more typical of anime than the staple style of shows past. The series was aired as a family program rather than a children's program in an attempt to capture a wider audience, including those who might have watched the earlier shows but grown older. Because of this new market, this series also contains the oldest cast of main characters, ranging from late teens to early twenties. Rather than the typical eight-month wait between the Japanese airing and the English dub, there was a full eighteen months between the dub and the Japanese airing. Not long after the discovery of an entry for the show on Toei's website, which featured anglicized names for some of the characters and the show's new English title, chosen by Toei, on April 25, 2007, Disney's ABC Network announced that it had signed an agreement with Toei Animation to license the show. Much of the staff that worked on ""Digimon Adventure"", including director Jeff Nimoy, returned to work on ""Data Squad"". Because Disney had the rights to the show outside of Asia, it was aired in different channels throughout the world than past incarnations. Bandai, in order to grab the older Digimon fans, wanted the reappearance of a Digimon from the old series, which was chosen to be the original main Digimon, Agumon. Plot summary. A 14-year-old boy, Marcus Damon, an undefeated ultimate fighter (street fighter in the original Japanese version), meets Agumon, who has escaped from DATS, a secret government organization set up to defend the human world from invading wild Digimon. After fighting each other, the two quickly become friends, and through a series of events, are inducted into DATS, where they hope to grow in strength. Marcus' team-mates include 14-year-old Thomas H. Norstein, a young prodigy, with his partner Gaomon, and 18-year-old Yoshino ""Yoshi"" Fujieda who has Lalamon for her partner. As the series progresses, Thomas discovers that Digimon respond to the ""darkness"" in humans, putting them at odds with monsters who seek to use humanity's own vices to bolster their own power. The plot thickens with the introduction of Merukimon, one of the rulers (as a member of the Olympus Twelve, Merukimon has a god status in the Digital World), of the Digital World who rules the eastern Digital World and lives in the Infinite Ice Ridge, Biyomon and the human boy Keenan Krier, who serves him along with his partner Falcomon. The DATS team tries to unfold the reason for their hatred of humankind, until it is revealed that the real enemy was Akihiro Kurata, a scientist who led an attack on the Digital World years before that resulted in the death of many Digimon, including Keenan's adoptive mother, Frigimon. Kurata gained the support of the Japanese government and important businessmen like Thomas' father on his plan to destroy all Digimon in the Digital World, claiming they were a threat to mankind. But this was only a facade to occult his main objective. He harnesses the energy of the Digimon he destroyed to power-up Belphemon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon/Seven Great Demon Lords, and uses it in his attempt to rule the Human World (and eventually the Digital World), but his ambitions were shattered by the efforts of Marcus and his allies. Kurata's last act was triggering a bomb which collapsed the frontier between the Human and Digital Worlds, putting both en route on collision, which could have led to the destruction of both realms. The collision was halted by the desperate efforts of BanchoLeomon who ordered Marcus to search for Yggdrasil/King Drasil, the Supreme Ruler and God of the Digital World. When the DATS team finally met King Drasil, they discovered that his decision to deal with the crisis unfolded, was to protect the Digital World by destroying the Human World, as the two worlds could not coexist in the same dimension. To perform this task, he assembled his elite guard, the Royal Knights. Marcus was confused at first because King Drasil somehow had the appearance of his father, Dr. Spencer Damon, who disappeared in the Digital World years before. But it was revealed that King Drasil took his father's body, and his soul was somehow preserved by BanchoLeomon, who was revealed to be Spencer's partner Digimon. After defeating some of the Royal Knights, the DATS team decided to confront King Drasil himself, who after being expelled from Spencer's body, transformed himself into an all-powerful robotic form determined to destroy the Human World by itself. However, even when the Royal Knights rebel against King Drasil, it won't give up its goal, attempting to destroy both worlds and create a new world. Using their emotions, Marcus and Agumon finally defeat King Drasil, and the two worlds cease their collision course. Before disappearing, King Drasil brings Spencer back to life and he returns to his family, but the Digimon decide to return to the Digital World to help restore it, and in the end Marcus decides to not part with Agumon and goes with them. 5 years later, Keenan and Kristy, Marcus' sister, go to the same school together. Thomas finally managed to find a cure for his sister's illness and became the youngest scientist to win the Nobel Prize at age 19. Yoshi has joined the police with the remaining DATS members, and Marcus and Agumon have become peacekeepers in the Digital World, breaking up fighting between rival Digimon factions as seen when stopping an argument between a group of Goblimon and Shamanmon. Media. Anime. Digimon Savers aired 48 episodes on Fuji TV in Japan from April 2, 2006 to March 25, 2007. In Germany, the series first aired on RTL 2 from November 30, 2007 to February 14, 2008. Digimon Data Squad finished airing in the US on Jetix on November 1, 2008, 13 months after premiering on the October 1, 2007. In Brazil, twenty episodes have aired on Rede Globo, since August 10, 2009. After that, the series was no longer broadcast. In Latin America (including Brazil), the anime premiered on Disney XD on February 22, 2010. Since Monday 15 March, Digimon Data Squad finally began airing in the United Kingdom on Kix! (Only on Sky and FreeSat). Since then, it continually airs every day at 7am, 1pm and 4pm throughout the day, however since ""Pinky and the Brain"" premiered it is only shown at 7am, 09:30am, 11:30am and 3:30pm. It was announced on February 12, 2009 that Toei Animation has signed Well Go USA instead of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment with the DVD rights to Digimon Data Squad, and the first thirteen US sub and dub episodes has been made available on May 26, 2009. The first DVD showed the North American edited TV version as seen on Disney XD. The second DVD set was available on May 25, 2010, this set will also feature promo videos for the series. There are no uncut DVDs (outside of Japan and Brazil). The release of the third DVD set is unknown. Madman Entertainment have released all 48 episodes across four sets on Region 4 DVD in Australia and New Zealand with only the US English Edited TV dub by Studiopolis. Brazil had released several DVDS of the show. It's unknown whether New Video Group had obtained the rights to release the season on DVD. Video games. As it is part of a resurgence of the Digimon franchise, Digimon Data Squad has a number of related video games associated with it. "

wikipedia-3973736," Corneal dystrophy  Corneal dystrophy is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by bilateral abnormal deposition of substances in the transparent front part of the eye called the cornea.  Pathophysiology. A corneal dystrophy can be caused by an accumulation of extraneous material in the cornea, including lipids and cholesterol crystals. Signs and symptoms. Corneal dystrophy may not significantly affect vision in the early stages. However, it does require proper evaluation and treatment for restoration of optimal vision. Corneal dystrophies usually manifest themselves during the first or second decade but sometimes later. It appears as grayish white lines, circles, or clouding of the cornea. Corneal dystrophy can also have a crystalline appearance. There are over 20 corneal dystrophies that affect all parts of the cornea. These diseases share many traits: Corneal dystrophies affect vision in widely differing ways. Some cause severe visual impairment, while a few cause no vision problems and are diagnosed during a specialized eye examination by an ophthalmologist. Other dystrophies may cause repeated episodes of pain without leading to permanent loss of vision.  Diagnosis. Diagnosis can be established on clinical grounds and this may be enhanced with studies on surgically excised corneal tissue and in some cases with molecular genetic analyses. As clinical manifestations widely vary with the different entities, corneal dystrophies should be suspected when corneal transparency is lost or corneal opacities occur spontaneously, particularly in both corneas, and especially in the presence of a positive family history or in the offspring of consanguineous parents.  Superficial corneal dystrophies - ""Meesmann dystrophy"" is characterized by distinct tiny bubble-like, punctate opacities that form in the central corneal epithelium and to a lesser extent in the peripheral cornea of both eyes during infancy that persists throughout life. Symmetrical reticular opacities form in the superficial central cornea of both eyes at about 4–5 years of age in ""Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy"". Patient remains asymptomatic until epithelial erosions precipitate acute episodes of ocular hyperemia, pain, and photophobia. Visual acuity eventually becomes reduced during the second and third decades of life following a progressive superficial haze and an irregular corneal surface.In ""Thiel-Behnke dystrophy"", sub-epithelial corneal opacities form a honeycomb-shaped pattern in the superficial cornea. Multiple prominent gelatinous mulberry-shaped nodules form beneath the corneal epithelium during the first decade of life in ""Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy"" which cause photophobia, tearing, corneal foreign body sensation and severe progressive loss of vision. ""Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy"" is characterized by feather shaped opacities and microcysts in the corneal epithelium that are arranged in a band-shaped and sometimes whorled pattern. Painless blurred vision sometimes begins after sixty years of life.  Corneal stromal dystrophies - ""Macular corneal dystrophy"" is manifested by a progressive dense cloudiness of the entire corneal stroma that usually first appears during adolescence and eventually causing severe visual impairment. In ""Granular corneal dystrophy"" multiple small white discrete irregular spots that resemble bread crumbs or snowflakes become apparent beneath Bowman zone in the superficial central corneal stroma. They initially appear within the first decade of life. Visual acuity is more or less normal. ""Lattice dystrophy"" starts as fine branching linear opacities in Bowman's layer in the central area and spreads to the preiphery. Recurrent corneal erosions may occur. The hallmark of ""Schnyder corneal dystrophy"" is the accumulation of crystals within the corneal stroma which cause corneal clouding typically in a ring-shaped fashion. Posterior corneal dystrophies - ""Fuchs corneal dystrophy"" presents during the fifth or sixth decade of life. The characteristic clinical findings are excrescences on a thickened Descemet membrane (cornea guttae), generalized corneal edema and decreased visual acuity. In advanced cases, abnormalities are found in the all layers of the cornea. In ""posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy"" small vesicles appear at the level of Descemet membrane. Most patients remain asymptomatic and corneal edema is usually absent. ""Congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy"" is characterized by a diffuse ground-glass appearance of both corneas and markedly thickened (2–3 times thicker than normal) corneas from birth or infancy. Differential diagnosis. Main differential diagnosis include various causes of monoclonal gammopathy, lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase deficiency, Fabry disease, cystinosis, tyrosine transaminase deficiency, systemic lysosomal storage diseases, and several skin diseases (X-linked ichthyosis, keratosis follicularis spinolosa decalvans). Historically, an accumulation of small gray variable shaped punctate opacities of variable shape in the central deep corneal stroma immediately anterior to Descemet membrane were designated deep filiform dystrophy and cornea farinata because of their resemblance to commas, circles, lines, threads (filiform), flour (farina) or dots. These abnormalities are now known to accompany X-linked ichthyosis ,steroid sulfatase deficiency, caused by steroid sulfatase gene mutations and are currently usually not included under the rubric of the corneal dystrophies.  In the past, the designation vortex corneal dystrophy (corneal verticillata) was applied to a corneal disorder characterized by the presence of innumerable tiny brown spots arranged in curved whirlpool-like lines in the superficial cornea. An autosomal dominant mode of transmission was initially suspected, but later it was realized that these individuals were affected hemizygous males and asymptomatic female carriers of an X-linked systemic metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase, known as Fabry disease.  Classification. Corneal dystrophies are commonly subdivided depending on its specific location within the cornea. It can be basically divided into ""anterior"", ""stromal"", or ""posterior"" according to the layer of the cornea affected by the dystrophy. The following classification is by Klintworth: Superficial dystrophies: Stromal dystrophies: Posterior dystrophies: Treatment. Early stages may be asymptomatic and may not require any intervention. Initial treatment may include hypertonic eyedrops and ointment to reduce the corneal edema and may offer symptomatic improvement prior to surgical intervention.  Suboptimal vision caused by corneal dystrophy usually requires surgical intervention in the form of corneal transplantation. Penetrating keratoplasty, a common type of corneal transplantation, is commonly performed for extensive corneal dystrophy. With penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant), the long term results are good-excellent. Recent surgical improvements have been made which have increased the success rate for this procedure. However, recurrence of the disease in the donor graft may happen. Superficial corneal dystrophies do not need a penetrating keratoplasty as the deeper corneal tissue is unaffected, therefore a lamellar keratoplasty may be used instead. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) can be used to excise or ablate the abnormal corneal tissue. Patients with superficial corneal opacities are suitable candidates for a this procedure. Genetics. Different corneal dystrophies are caused by mutations in the CHST6, KRT3, KRT12, PIP5K3, SLC4A11, TACSTD2, TGFBI, and UBIAD1 genes. Mutations in TGFB1 which encodes ""transforming growth factor beta"" cause several forms of corneal dystrophies including granular corneal dystrophy, lattice corneal dystrophy, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy, and Thiel-Behnke dystrophy. Corneal dystrophies may have a simple autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or rarely X-linked recessive Mendelian mode of inheritance: "

wikipedia-3973859," Gécamines  Gécamines, or La Générale des Carrières et des Mines, is a state-owned mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Its principal products are copper (for which Katanga is well known, and which often accounted for 50% of export earnings), cobalt and zinc. Additional minerals mined include uranium. History. Gécamines is the successor to the Union Minière du Haut Katanga. On December 31, 1966, the Congolese government, under dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, took over the UMHK, an immensely profitable Belgian mining trust founded on 1906, and transformed it into a state-owned firm, Gécamines. From that point onwards the company's fortunes declined, as did those of the rest of the country (between 1965 and 1987, Congolese GDP per head fell by 2.4%). The Mobutu regime has been accused of theft of the nation's financial and physical treasure. For example, one Gécamines official estimated theft to amount to 10% of production.(citation needed). During Mobutu's presidency, Gecamines' fortunes have declined, and they are now are seeking to enter partnerships with other firms to avoid bankruptcy (Citation needed.) Nonetheless, the company remained crucial to Congolese finance: In 1989, Gécamines provided 85% of DR Congo's export earnings (against 60% provided by the UMHK in 1960), and 42% of public revenues, making it by far the most important company in the country. In the 1990s, Gécamines' financial situation took a blow, adversely affected by several issues, including the ageing of infrastructure and equipment, collapse of the mine of Kamoto, and ethnic riots in Shaba. These led to a slump in production, as can be seen in the copper production chart below. Operations. Production of copper, by year. Despite these unfortunate figures, it must be remembered that Gécamines is still in possession of proven, probable, and possible ore reserves of copper (56 Mt contained metal), cobalt (4 Mt), and germanium (3.4 Mt), and zinc (6.4 Mt). With assistance from the World Bank, aided by partnerships with other firms and by proper governance in DR Congo, Gécamines hopes to resume its former copper production. "
wikipedia-3973930," Electrophoretic mobility shift assay  An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or mobility shift electrophoresis, also referred as a gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay, band shift assay, or gel retardation assay, is a common affinity electrophoresis technique used to study protein–DNA or protein–RNA interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension, and promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin and Fried and Crothers. Principle. A mobility shift assay is electrophoretic separation of a protein–DNA or protein–RNA mixture on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel for a short period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel). The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see gel electrophoresis). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly). Under the correct experimental conditions, the interaction between the DNA and protein is stabilized and the ratio of bound to unbound nucleic acid on the gel reflects the fraction of free and bound probe molecules as the binding reaction enters the gel. This stability is in part due to the low ionic strength of the buffer, but also due to a ""caging effect"", in that the protein, surrounded by the gel matrix, is unable to diffuse away from the probe before they recombine. If the starting concentrations of protein and probe are known, and if the stoichiometry of the complex is known, the apparent affinity of the protein for the nucleic acid sequence may be determined. The number derived is the apparent Kd as the true Kd cannot be determined from this type of assay because there is no equilibrium binding between the substrate complexes. If the protein concentration is not known but the complex stoichiometry is, the protein concentration can be determined by increasing the concentration of DNA probe until further increments do not increase the fraction of protein bound. By comparison with a set of standard dilutions of free probe run on the same gel, the number of moles of protein can be calculated. An antibody that recognizes the protein can be added to this mixture to create an even larger complex with a greater shift. This method is referred to as a ""supershift assay"", and is used to unambiguously identify a protein present in the protein – nucleic acid complex. Often, an extra lane is run with a competitor oligonucleotide to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition (not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics. Once DNA-protein binding is determined ""in vitro"", a number of ""in silico"" algorithms can narrow the search for identification of the transcription factor. Consensus sequence oligonucleotides for the transcription factor of interest will be able to compete for the binding, eliminating the shifted band, and must be confirmed by supershift. If the predicted consensus sequence fails to compete for binding, identification of the transcription factor may be aided by Multiplexed Competitor EMSA (MC-EMSA), whereby large sets of consensus sequences are multiplexed in each reaction, and where one set competes for binding, the individual consensus sequences from this set are run in a further reaction.  For visualization purposes, the nucleic acid fragment is usually labelled with a radioactive, fluorescent or biotin label. Standard ethidium bromide staining is less sensitive than these methods and can lack the sensitivity to detect the nucleic acid if small amounts are used in these experiments. When using a biotin label, streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase is used to detect the DNA fragment (Non-radioactive EMSA review). While isotopic DNA labeling has little or no effect on protein binding affinity, use of non-isotopic labels including flurophores or biotin can alter the affinity and/or stoichiometry of the protein interaction of interest. Competition between fluorophore- or biotin-labeled probe and unlabeled DNA of the same sequence can be used to determine whether the label alters binding affinity or stoichiometry. "
wikipedia-3973933," Hydrogen breath test  A hydrogen breath test (or HBT) is used as a clinical medical diagnosis for people with irritable bowel syndrome, and common food intolerances. The test is simple, non-invasive, and is performed after a short period of fasting (typically 8–12 hours). Even though the test is normally known as a ""Hydrogen Breath Test"" some physicians may also test for methane in addition to hydrogen. Many studies have shown that some patients (approximately 35% or more) do not produce hydrogen but actually produce methane. Some patients produce a combination of the two gases. Other patients don't produce any gas, which are known as ""Non-Responders""; it has not been yet determined whether they may actually produce another gas. In addition to hydrogen and methane, some facilities also utilize carbon dioxide () in the patients' breath to determine if the breath samples that are being analyzed are not contaminated (either with room air or bronchial dead space air). Testing may be administered at hospitals, clinics, physician offices or if the physician/laboratory has the proper equipment and breath collection kit, patients can collect samples at home to then be mailed in for analysis. Many testing kits are emerging in the breath testing market claiming to be able to collect proper samples and providing analytical results to individuals collecting samples at home and sending to laboratories for analysis. Consumers are always urged to call the manufacturers of these test kits and do their research to ensure that the test they are performing is being collected and analyzed properly. There is currently a patented breath-collection test kit offered by a U.S. manufacturer which was designed and patented for the proper collection and storage of breath samples. Proper collection and analysis of samples is imperative in the breath hydrogen testing realm. Some testing kits indicate a patients can blow into a test tube with a straw and close the top in a predetermined amount of time for proper storage and analysis; this method of breath collection for a hydrogen breath test should be confirmed as this means for collection was originally designed to collect a sample from a labels ""Helicobacter pylori"" breath test which works well for this method of collection, however other individuals which have performed this method for the hydrogen breath test have had to repeat tests and/or received inconclusive results. This could be due to improper analysis on instrumentation, improper collection from patients, or the test collection method. Conditions. Tests vary from country to country, so the following information is provided as a rough guide to typical uses of the hydrogen breath test: Fructose malabsorption - the patient takes a base reading of hydrogen levels in his/her breath. The patient is then given a small amount of fructose, and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours. The basis of the test is a failure to absorb the given sugar, which is then metabolized by bacteria that give off either hydrogen or methane. Therefore, the more gas that is produced, the less absorption has occurred. If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a fructose malabsorber. If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive. If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value. Lactose malabsorption - the patient takes a base reading of hydrogen levels in his/her breath. The patient is then given a small amount of pure lactose (typically 20 to 25 g), and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours. If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a lactose malabsorber. If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive. If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value. However, recent study suggest that testing may not correlate with any actual diagnosis. Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome (SBBOS) or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) - the patient is either given a challenge dose of glucose, also known as dextrose (75-100 grams), or lactulose (10 grams). A baseline breath sample is collected, and then additional samples are collected at 15 minute or 20 minute intervals for 3–5 hours. Positive diagnosis for a lactulose SIBO breath test - typically positive if the patient produces approximately 20 ppm of hydrogen and/or methane within the first two hours (indicates bacteria in the small intestine), followed by a much larger peak (colonic response). This is also known as a biphasic pattern. Lactulose is not absorbed by the digestive system and can help determine distal end bacterial overgrowth, which means the bacteria are lower in the small intestine. Positive diagnosis for a glucose SIBO breath test - glucose is absorbed by the digestive system so studies have shown it to be harder to diagnose distal end bacterial overgrowth since the glucose typically doesn't reach the colon before being absorbed. An increase of approximately 12 ppm or more in hydrogen and/or methane during the breath test could conclude bacterial overgrowth. Recent study indicates ""The role of testing for SIBO in individuals with suspected IBS remains unclear.""  The excess hydrogen or methane is assumed to be typically caused by an overgrowth of otherwise normal intestinal bacteria. Other breath tests that can be taken include: Sucrose Intolerance, d-xylose and sorbitol. "

wikipedia-3974048," Identity fraud  Identity fraud may occur when someone steals personal information, opens credit card accounts in the victim's name without permission, and charges merchandise to those accounts. Conversely, identity fraud does not occur when a credit card is simply stolen. Stealing one’s credit card may be consumer fraud, but is not identity fraud. Identity fraud is a synonym of unlawful identity change. It indicates unlawful activities that use the identity of another person or of a non-existing person as a principal tool for merchandise procurement. Identity fraud can occur without identity theft, as in the case where the fraudster has been given someone's identity information for other reasons but uses it to commit fraud, or when the person whose identity is being used is colluding with the person committing the fraud. One case of identity fraud is when the PlayStation Network was hacked into, and the man responsible for this took the information from everyone who had their credit card information installed on the Network. It took three months to fix the problem, when it occurred. Moreover, identity fraud does not necessarily involve colluding or theft of another's personal information; it can also involve the use of fake names, ID cards, falsified or forged documents, and lying about his or her own age to simply ""hide"" his or her true identity. Reasons for this type of identity fraud may include wanting to purchase tobacco or alcohol as a minor as well as desire to continue playing on a certain sports team or organization when that person is really too old to compete.  Stolen identification. Identity fraud is the act of using a stolen identity to obtain goods or services by deception. This usually involves the use of stolen, forged or counterfeit documents such as a passport or driving licence. The term ‘goods or services’ typically includes bank accounts, mortgages, credit cards, rail products, an application for a job or simply dishonest claims for state benefits. Organized crime. False identities are used, for instance, by organized crime to access goods and services or to participate in money laundering. Importantly a large proportion of identity fraud is linked to people trafficking, money laundering, drug running and terrorism.. Information (from Interpol, the National Fraud Authority (NFA) and UK Fraud Prevention Services (CIFAS) highlights the financial impact of identity fraud but takes no account of the distress caused to the tens of thousands of people and companies that fall prey to this form of largely organised crime. United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom the following factors are likely to contribute to the exponential growth in identity fraud: In the UK, identity fraud rose by 32% in 2009 costing commerce and industry many millions of pounds. The problem is serious and increasing. The future climate in the UK is excellent for increased identity fraud and illegal working. The financial institutions and employment agencies may not be prepared for the onslaught. Minimising the impact of identity fraud is a very complex business and some organisations find they are continually playing ‘catch-up’. Of course, there is a general acceptance that a small percentage of accounts will always go ‘bad’ no matter how vigilant the organisation is and it is often left to bank fraud units or credit card fraud departments to clean up after the crime rather than identity frtaud being the 100% focus of a dedicated identity fraud/theft department with a brief to intercept potential frauds before they are perpetrated. At a recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble warned that with 11 million stolen or lost passports in circulation, passport fraud is becoming a major global threat. The National Fraud Authority (NFA) recently estimated that all forms of fraud accounts for losses to the UK economy of £30 billion a year and CIFAS - The UK Fraud Prevention Service (CIFAS) stated that identity fraud rose by 32% in 2009 compared with 2008. CIFAS report that in 2010 there were 89,000 victims of identity fraud in the UK. Identity fraud rates across the UK vary depending upon where you live in the country. Experian ProtectMyId reported that there were 72 ID fraud attempts for every 100,000 London adults in 2010, compared with just 9 in the North and 5 in Northern Ireland In addition to this, a recent survey of employment agencies revealed a worrying lack of personnel screening during the recruitment process. The recession has led to a major increase in outsourcing and the use of temporary and agency staff by many organisations. The lack of understanding or knowledge in implementing the Government’s Baseline Personal Security Standard procedures frequently results in illegal workers being accepted by recruitment agencies and the organisations ultimately employing them falling foul of the UK Border Agency regulations. Importantly, even if ‘Right-to-Work’ checks are carried out on persons holding non-EU passports as recommended by the BPSS this will only be scratching the surface of the problem, because approximately 70% of fraudsters use counterfeit or forged EU passports and ID cards.

wikipedia-3974066," Sibi Jataka  Sibi Jataka is one of the Jataka tales detailing episodes of the various incarnations of Buddha. Each Jataka tale illustrates the Buddhist ideals of ""Dharma"" and sacrifice in various forms. Tradition states that these tales were narrated by Buddha himself during his ministry in India to emphasise that by the constant practice of virtuous deeds one reaches the status of ""Nirvana"" or enlightenment.  The Story of King Sibi. King Sibi ruled over the kingdom of Sibi and was known for his philanthropy. One day, Indra and Agni came to test the limits of the king's generosity. The two gods disguised themselves as a hawk and a dove. The hawk started chasing the dove and the dove fell on King Sibi's lap trembling with fear. The hawk demanded the king to surrender the dove as its prey. The king refused saying that the dove had sought his protection.  After much argument the hawk agreed to leave the dove alone if the king would offer a piece of flesh from his own body which was equivalent to the weight of the dove. The king was more than happy to make such a sacrifice. Strangely, after endless slicing off his flesh and placing it on the scale, the king found that he could not equal the weight of the dove. The king threw his entire body on the scale and even then the scales tipped in favor of the dove. At this point the hawk and the dove revealed their true identity and praised the king for his unbounded charitable spirit. Variations. There are many versions of the Sibi Jataka and the one narrated above is also found in the ""Mahabharata"". Another version of the story of Sibi is narrated as follows:  In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, the two versions of the story are attributed to two different kings. The king who sacrifices his eyes is called ""Kuai-mu Wang"" - the king with happy eyes. Cave Paintings. The story is depicted in numerous Buddhist cave paintings. An example of this can be found in Cave 17 at Ajanta. This shows a man holding a set of scales while the king is engaged in cutting his flesh out. The panel also shows the king’s courtiers, and subjects rejoicing this noble act of their king. A painting in the Mogao Caves (Cave 275) shows a panel illustrating five jataka tales. The two versions of the Sibi legend are depicted in this panel. Connections with the Chola Dynasty. The story of King Sibi has been linked with the South Indian dynasty of Cholas who ruled between c 100 C.E. to c. 1250 C.E. The later Cholas claimed to have descended from Sibi. The Tamil name for Sibi was ""Sembiyan"". This name was assumed by many Chola kings. "
wikipedia-3974197," Beverley Craven  Beverley Craven (born 28 July 1963 in Colombo, Sri Lanka) is a British singer-songwriter best known for her 1991 UK Top 5 hit single ""Promise Me"". Her most recent album, ""Close To Home"", was released in 2009. Craven has sold over 4 million records in her career. Biography. Early life. Craven, although British, was born in Colombo in July 1963 while her father was working for Kodak in Sri Lanka. Two years later the family returned to Hertfordshire and Craven began taking piano lessons at the age of seven, encouraged by her mother who was a classical violinist. Upon leaving school, she attended art college, whilst performing with various bands in London pubs, and writing songs. She was also an accomplished swimmer during her teens and competed in several local and national swimming competitions around the UK. Craven did not buy her first pop record until she was 15, especially buying records by singer-songwriters such as Elton John, Judi Tzuke, Stevie Wonder and, in particular, Kate Bush, all of whom influenced her music. At 18 she left school and her home and worked in a number of odd jobs. Having failed to find any sympathetic musicians with whom to play, at the age of 22 Craven decided to strike out on her own as a piano-playing singer and songwriter. Following a brief stint touring with soul singer Bobby Womack (who tried to sign her to his record label), she recorded her first set of demos and attracted the attention of Go West’s manager, John Glover. He quickly set about securing her a major music publishing deal with Warner Brothers and a development contract with Epic records followed. Debut album. In November 1988 she was sent to Los Angeles to work with some established songwriters and to ‘learn her craft’ playing in bars and restaurants. The experience was ‘unproductive’ she confesses, preferring even now to write alone. Soon afterwards, again in Los Angeles, she made her first attempt to record her debut album with Stewart Levine of Simply Red fame. However she felt the professionalism of the recordings failed to capture the naivete of her work and was relieved when Epic agreed. She went on to record with Paul Samwell-Smith, whose other production credits included Cat Stevens, Carly Simon and All About Eve. The album, ""Beverley Craven"" was eventually released in July 1990 and, although it initially failed to attract attention in the United Kingdom it found acceptance in Europe. It was not until April 1991 that she found success in her homeland. A re-released ""Promise Me"" was heavily promoted and eventually peaked at #3 in the UK singles chart, becoming her biggest hit. This success helped her debut album also chart at #3 in the UK, staying charted for over a year in the UK and eventually going double platinum in that country. The album sold in excess of 1,2 million copies worldwide. Other singles released to promote the album, including ""Holding On"" and ""Woman To Woman"" were less successful, but helped maintain the momentum. In 1992 she released a videotape titled Memories, recorded live at the Birmingham Symphony Hall. In February 1992, Craven performed at the Brit Awards show (following her nomination in three categories), winning the Best British Newcomer Award. She was eight months pregnant when she sang at the Brits and she gave birth to her first child, Mollie, less than a month later. ""Love Scenes"". Craven spent much of 1992 enjoying motherhood and recording her second album. ""Love Scenes"", again produced by Paul Samwell-Smith, was eventually released in September 1993. It peaked at #4 on the United Kingdom charts, but overall was much less successful than her debut, spending only 13 weeks on the charts. It spawned three singles, ""Love Scenes"", ""Mollie's Song"" (written for her daughter), and a cover of Abba's ""The Winner Takes It All"". These singles only became minor hits, with only the title track reaching the UK top 40. In 1993 she embarked on a twelve-date concert tour, and the following Christmas played a sell-out show at the Royal Albert Hall. ""Mixed Emotions"". Craven took a five-year hiatus after giving birth to two more daughters, and it was not until 1999 that she released her third album, ""Mixed Emotions"". Craven recorded the album in her home studio and for the first time produced the record herself. The album peaked at #46 in the UK, spending two weeks on the charts. The lead single ""I Miss You"" was only released as a promo single as the label refused to release it commercially. After promotion for this album ended, Craven left Epic Records and retired from the music industry to take care of her daughters. Also in 1999, Craven contributed lead vocals on the song ""The Very Last Time"", included on the album ""The Time Machine"", by Alan Parsons. 2000s. In 2004 ""The Very Best of Beverley Craven"" compilation album was released, and Craven embarked on a comeback to promote the record, making a handful of live concert appearances, but shortly after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Following treatment she was finally given the all-clear, and returned to the stage in 2006, doing more tours in subsequent years. In March 2009, Craven released her first album in ten years, ""Close To Home"", fully written and produced by herself. She released it on her own record label and sold it initially through her website and at concerts, although later in the year she made it available for purchase on online retailers and on digital outlets. The song ""Rainbows"", was released as a digital download single, and she filmed a videoclip of it. Present. Craven released a live DVD, titled ""Live in Concert"" in August 2010, as well as a songbook later in the year featuring songs from her four albums. Craven is now working on an autobiography. She is expected to tour the United Kingdom in 2011. Beverley is currently touring the UK and appeared at Farncombe Music Club, Surrey on Friday 5 October 2012 as an acoustic set. In the autumn of 2013, Beverley will be again playing at selected venues across the UK. Personal life. After meeting backstage at a Tears for Fears concert, in 1994 Craven married singer-songwriter Colin Campsie. The couple have three daughters: Mollie, Brenna and Constance (Connie). After being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in 2006, the couple separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. When Mollie appeared on the third series of ""Take Me Out"" on 11 February 2012, Craven appeared on the accompanying ITV2 show ""Take Me Out, The Gossip"", singing ""Promise Me"". "
wikipedia-3974223," West End Avenue  West End Avenue is a north-south thoroughfare on the West Side of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It originates at West 59th Street; the continuation of the street below 59th Street is called Eleventh Avenue. It runs from 59th Street to its termination where it merges with Broadway at 107th Street, at Straus Park. Traffic is two-way, except for the northernmost block. History. By the 1880s, the Upper West Side was fairly sparsely populated, and was called the ""West End"" because of its separation from the core of the city. Seeking to distinguish the area from the factories and tenements below 59th Street, a group of real estate developers renamed the northern portions of the West Side's avenues. West End Avenue was originally created in the 1880s as the northern extension of Eleventh Avenue, and was intended to be a commercial street serving the residents of the mansions to be constructed along Riverside Drive. Portions of West End Avenue were run down in the middle 20th Century, with Single Room Occupancy hotels, prostitutes and drug addicts a common sight. The city's economic comeback in the 1980s brought recovery and gentrification. The street retains stretches of late nineteenth-century town houses and several handsome churches and synagogues, but is almost entirely made up of handsome residential buildings about twelve stories tall built in the first decades of the twentieth century. The near total absence of retail on the street marks its quiet, residential character. Architecture. The street is noteworthy for its almost unbroken street wall of handsome apartment buildings punctuated by brief stretches of nineteenth-century townhouses and several handsome churches and synagogues.  Notable architecturally historicist houses of worship include: Among the more notable apartment buildings are  Two segments of the thoroughfare lie within designated New York City historic districts: both sides of the avenue from West 87th to West 94th Streets can be found in the Riverside-West End Historic District. The west side of the avenue from West 75th Street through mid-block between West 78th and West 79th streets and the east side between West 76th and West 77th streets are contained within the West End-Collegiate Historic District. Concern over building demolition filings coming upon the demolition of three row houses and a six-story elevator apartment building at the southwest corner of West End Avenue and West 86th Streets spurred a grass roots effort to seek historic district designation for the entire stretch north of Lincoln Towers from West 70th to West 107th streets. On March 18, 2009, the West End Avenue Preservation Society formally submitted a request for evaluation to the chair of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission along with a 260 page survey prepared by Andrew Dolkart.

wikipedia-3974262," Virginia State Route 28  State Route 28 is a primary state highway that traverses the counties of Loudoun, Fairfax, Prince William, and Fauquier in the U.S. state of Virginia. It is a major artery through Northern Virginia. Route description. Fauquier County. Route 28 starts at busy US 29/US 15 just north of Culpeper County, and intersects US 17 about three miles (5 km) from its beginning. It is two lanes throughout rural Fauquier County with a speed limit of 45 mph (70 km/h) and passes by farms and agricultural areas. Most of the way through Fauquier County Route 28 runs parallel to railroad tracks in order to serve the towns that are placed along them. Several historical markers can be seen along Route 28 as it passes through Fauquier including Supreme Court Justice John Marshall's birthplace and the raid on Catlett Station. For many years the old bridge for Route 28 could be seen just outside of Catlett. Historically, the Catlett Fire Department Parade would close Route 28 for several hours each spring, however, this practice was discontinued as traffic became heavier in the 1990s.  Not far from the Prince William county border Route 28 passes the Waat Bodang Temple. Route 28 then changes names to Catlett Road and leaves Fauquier County. Prince William County. Route 28 enters Prince William County at Nokesville. Upon leaving the town, it expands from two to four lanes and becomes Nokesville Road. Further on, it reaches its first interchange at SR 234 (Prince William Parkway), south of the City of Manassas.  VDOT has plans to create an interchange at Wellington Road in Manassas, mostly to grade-separate the crossing of Route 28 with nearby railroad tracks. This $18.3 million project was certified under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on October 5, 2009, and the contract was awarded on July 14, 2010. Route 28 is a main thoroughfare through Manassas, and separates into a one-way pair of Church and Center Streets in front of a Confederate cemetery. The split routes run through the center of the city and rejoin several blocks later, merging into Centreville Road. The road passes briefly through Manassas Park, than passes through Yorkshire until it crosses over Bull Run into Centreville, Fairfax County. Fairfax County. Route 28/Centreville Road enters Fairfax County at Centreville, at which point it transitions from an undivided to a divided highway. It starts as a suburban arterial with only at-grade intersections, widening to six lanes at an intersection with Machen Road on the south side of Centreville. In the middle of Centreville, Route 28 intersects Interstate 66 and US 29 at partial cloverleafs; the US 29 interchange has traffic signals on US 29 but none on Route 28, while the interchange with I-66 has traffic signals on mainline Route 28. North of US 29 an expressway with both interchanges and at-grade intersections and changes designation to Sully Road. After a cloverleaf interchange with Westfields Boulevard, Route 28 enters Chantilly, and transitions from an expressway to a six lane freeway.  Route 28 travels through a single-point urban interchange with Willard Road and continues through Chantilly. Route 28 then enters Oak Hill and heads north along the eastern edge of the Dulles Airport. The next interchanges are for US 50 in Chantilly, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center (an annex of the National Air and Space Museum), McLearen Road, and Frying Pan Road on the south end of Herndon. The road then exits into Loudoun County. Loudoun County. The first interchange in Loudoun County is at the entrance to Dulles International Airport, with access to the airport itself, to the Dulles Toll/Access Road (State Route 267) and Dulles Greenway, and to Innovation Avenue (State Route 209). Continuing north through Loudoun County, Route 28 has interchanges with Old Ox Road and Sterling Boulevard, the former also servicing Herndon. The next interchange is an elaborate interchange with Route 625, Waxpool Road and Church Road, which lead into Ashburn and Sterling, respectively. This interchange features two exits for Waxpool Road from the northbound lanes of Route 28: a left flyover and right loop ramp. Heading north, Route 28 passes through the industrial and commercial areas of Dulles. It is still known as Sully Road through this stretch, although within Loudoun County it is co-designated as Darrell Green Boulevard, after the former Washington Redskins player. A northbound-only, exit-only ramp at Warp Drive is followed by a partial cloverleaf serving Nokes Boulevard and the Dulles Town Center shopping mall. Route 28 ends at VA 7 in Sterling in a complete directional T interchange. Improvement project. In 1987, Virginia authorized the creation of special tax districts. Fairfax and Loudoun Counties quickly formed the first transportation improvement district in the Commonwealth, by imposing a 20 cent per $100 real estate surcharge on commercial and industrial property located near Route 28. The surcharge financed bonds to pay for improvements to Route 28. From 1988 to 1991, of Route 28 were widened from two lanes to six lanes and interchanges were built at Routes 50, 7 and the Dulles Toll Road. The completion schedule for each funded interchange and roadway is as follows: Clark is currently studying the widening of Route 28 to eight lanes and will file a proposal in the fall of 2010 expected to cover at least 30% of the 6-lane stretch. For a decade there have also been proposals to extend Route 28 to north to connect it with Interstate 370 in Gaithersburg, Maryland over a Techway Bridge across the Potomac River. "
wikipedia-3974307," Read the Bills Act  The Read the Bills Act (RTBA) is proposed legislation intended to require the United States Congress to read the legislation that it passes. It was originally written in 2006 by Downsize DC, a non-profit organization focused on decreasing the size of the federal government. The proposed act is a response to the passing of bills that are thousands of pages long and are passed without copies being made available to the members of Congress who vote on the bill. The bill is aimed at limiting the size and growth of the federal government. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) stated his support for it in November 2010. Senator Paul went on to sponsor and propose the bill in the 112th congress as S.3360 on June 28, 2012.  Similarly, a separate bill nicknamed the ""Read the Bill Act"" would require bills to be posted publicly 72 hours prior to consideration in Congress. Unlike the Downsize DC proposal, this bill is supported by ReadTheBill.org (part of the Sunlight Foundation) with the primary aim to increase transparency in government. It was introduced in the U.S. House (by Rep. Brian Baird in 2006 , 2007 , and 2009 ) and Senate (by Sen. Jim Bunning in 2009 , and by Sen. John Ensign in 2011 ). The Senate version differs in a few ways, including a requirement to have the Congressional Budget Office provide an evaluation of the proposed legislation. "
wikipedia-3974329," Canada Permanent Resident Card  The Permanent Resident Card (PR Card; commonly and originally referred to as the ""Maple Leaf Card"") was introduced on 28 June 2002 upon the implementation of Canada's ""Immigration and Refugee Protection Act"". It is the primary method by which Canadian permanent residents (formerly known as ""landed immigrants"") can prove their status and is the only document that allows permanent residents to return to Canada by a commercial carrier (bus, train, airplane). However, those from nations not requiring a visa to travel to Canada may be allowed entry on the strength of their passports alone. Application Process. New permanent residents. It is necessary to supply a Canadian residential address at the time of landing. If a Canadian address cannot be supplied at the time, it is necessary to provide one to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) within 180 days. Otherwise a new application for a PR Card will be required, at a cost of $50 to the applicant. Manual applications for permanent residence cards take on average 106 days, compared to 72 days for those applied for at the time of landing. There is no fee for a PR Card applied for at the time of the landing. Existing permanent residents. Permanent residents as of 28 June 2002 and new permanent residents who did not provide a Canadian residential address, or whose PR Card was lost or stolen, must apply to CIC's processing centre in Sydney, Nova Scotia for a new card. The fee is CAD$50. In these cases, the PR Card must be collected in person at a CIC office in Canada. Validity of a PR card. The PR Card is normally issued for 5 years. In some circumstances it may be issued for 1 year only. Possession of a valid PR Card does not ensure that one's permanent resident status will remain valid until the expiry date. In some circumstances - notably where breaches of residence obligations are involved - permanent resident status can be lost before this date. Similarly, a PR Card's expiration date does not indicate that the holder's status as a permanent resident has expired, or will expire, on that date. It is the date after which the card must be replaced with a new card, if the holder is still a legal permanent resident at that time. PR Card application lodged outside Canada. It is not possible to apply for the PR Card outside Canada. Instead, those permanent residents wishing to prove their status may apply for a single use Travel Document which allows a journey to Canada as a permanent resident. The application may be submitted to any CIC office outside Canada and the fee is $50 CAD. Application Form. Previously, there were different application forms for different migrants depending on their circumstances. However, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) integrated those different forms to create a new general application form for all permanent residence categories called ""'Generic Application Form for Canada' (IMM0008)"". All existing application forms (IMM5202, IMM5001, IMM5002) are replaced by the new IMM0008 form from July 18, 2011. Processing times. CIC publishes processing times for PR Cards on their website. Application for Permanent Residence Cards are processed at the CIC Case Processing Centre (CPC) in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Proof of status in Canada. Whether one is a permanent resident or not is determined by the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. While possession of a valid PR Card creates a ""presumption"" that a person is a permanent resident, it is not compulsory for a permanent resident to hold one. In fact, it is possible to hold a valid PR Card and at the same time face loss of permanent resident status due to not meeting residence obligations. Similarly, it is possible to be a Canadian permanent resident and not hold a valid PR Card, although it may be more difficult to prove one's status. Required to enter Canada. In general, permanent residents must present a valid PR Card or Travel Document to a commercial carrier (e.g. airline, railway, bus company) in order to board a Canada-bound journey. This requirement is effective from 31 December 2003. However, those who hold passports that do not require tourist visas to visit Canada may normally board a flight on the strength of their passport alone (although some airlines may be reluctant to allow this if only a one-way ticket is held). Similarly, a PR Card or Travel Document is not required for those passport holders (described in the previous paragraph) to cross the land frontier into Canada from the U.S. Using Canadian PR card as a proof of status and for visa-free travel. In Canada. A PR Card is the most convenient way of proving status to authorities within Canada (e.g. provincial governments, employers, schools). Most permanent residents have other documentation (such as original landing papers) which is also acceptable. Outside Canada. Foreign government authorities may require the production of a PR Card in some circumstances: A PR Card is the easiest way for any Canadian permanent resident applying to any foreign government for a tourist visa to prove his or her status in Canada. Provided, that the individual fulfills certain conditions, it is usually easier for a Canadian PR card holder to get a tourist visa to most countries, where the individual's original passport/country of citizenship may not provide direct visa free entry and/or may require strict visa entry criteria to a designated country.

He was selected in the squad for the 2012 Six Nations Championship, during which he rediscovered his try-scoring ability. scoring 5 tries in Ireland's first three games, including braces against Italy and France. British and Irish Lions. On 21 April 2009, Bowe was named as a member of the British and Irish Lions for the 2009 tour to South Africa. He started in the first match on the tour, versus a Royal XV and, in this game, became the first try scorer of the 2009 tour. He then scored two tries against the Golden Lions which contributed to his selection for the test side. He wasn't included for the next two games before coming back for the match against Western Province where he scored his fourth try of the tour and set up another for Ugo Monye. His form on the Tour was outstanding, winning him praise from the sporting media. On 18 June 2009, Ian McGeechan named Bowe in his test side to face South Africa in Durban on 20 June where The Lions lost 26–21 . Bowe, although holding his own in defence, wasn't given any opportunities to run. He was again selected on the wing for the second test. The Lions lost 28–25 due to a last minute penalty by Morné Steyn to clinch the series for the Springboks. Bowe in this game had more opportunities to run and was dangerous in attack. Due to injuries to Brian O'Driscoll and Jamie Roberts, Bowe was selected at outside centre in a partnership with Riki Flutey. He came second behind Jamie Roberts for the ""Player of the Series"" award. In April 2013 he was selected as a member of the 2013 British & Irish Lions squad to tour Australia. While playing against the Queensland Reds, Bowe broke a bone in his hand, which threatened to end his Lions tour. He managed to recover from the injury in time to be included the starting fifteen in the last two tests against Australia, taking the place from Alex Cuthbert who had replaced him whist he was injured, but was unable to score any points in the test series. TV work. Bowe was guest chef in episode two of series seven of ""The Restaurant"" in 2010. He appeared on RTÉ's ""The Late Late Show"" on 21 May 2010 where he was quizzed on his version of the song ""The Black Velvet Band"" which he sang during Ireland's Grand Slam celebrations. Bowe was the focus of an RTÉ documentary ""Tommy Bowe's Bodycheck"", which examined what it takes to be a top professional rugby player. Family. His father, Paul, won a Leinster Schools' Cup medal with Newbridge College on the 1970 team, captained by Mick Quinn and went on to win a cap for Leinster Schools. Ann, his mother, is a physiotherapist in Co. Monaghan and she runs her own practice. His sister, Hannah, is an Ireland hockey international and she is also a member of the Monaghan ladies Gaelic football team. His grandfather won a Military Cross in the Normandy Landings. David, the youngest in the family is studying and playing rugby for his college in England. His girlfriend is former Miss Wales Lucy Whitehouse. Philanthropy. Bowe lent his name to the Tommy Bowe Challenge which was completed in both 2011 and 2012 to raise money for the Glaslough Harriers. "
wikipedia-3974732," Québec solidaire  Québec solidaire (QS) is a social democratic and sovereigntist political party in Quebec, Canada. The party and media outlets use the name ""Québec solidaire"" in both French and English, but the party's name is sometimes translated as ""Solidarity Quebec"" or ""Quebec Solidarity"" in English-language media. Principles. In addition to advocating the independence of Quebec from Canada, the party's platform revolves around environmentalism, feminism, social justice, proportional representation and participatory democracy, pacifism, aboriginal rights, and alter-globalism. The party favours aboriginal rights, immigration, and human dignity, and opposes discrimination including racism and homophobia. The aim of QS is in part to widen the appeal and organizational structure of the Union des forces progressistes (UFP), and to give a formal political voice to altermondialist movements like Option Citoyenne. As such, QS aims to bring together progressive forces across the broad left wing of the Quebec political spectrum. QS presents itself as an alternative to the main three parties in Quebec (the Parti Québécois, the Parti libéral du Québec, and the Coalition Avenir Québec), saying that the three are different faces of neoliberalism, which QS considers right-wing. QS also holds that its view of an independent Quebec is a completely different project than that of the Parti Québecois. Rather than working for independence for its own sake, QS works for an internationalist independence - an independence based on principles of social justice. For QS, independence is a means to an end, not an end in itself. History. Founding. Québec solidaire was founded on 04 February 2006 in Montreal by the merger of the left-wing party Union des forces progressistes (UFP) and the alter-globalization political movement Option Citoyenne, led by Françoise David. It was formed around a number of activists and politicians who had written ""Pour un Québec solidaire"", a left-wing response to ""Pour un Québec lucide"". ""Pour un Québec lucide"" presented a distinctly neoliberal analysis of and set of solutions to Québec's problems, particularly criticizing the sovereignty movement as distracting from Québec's real issues and the Québec social model as inefficient and out-of-date. ""Pour un Québec solidaire"" presented an alternate analysis, and later its writers formed the party Québec solidaire, taking its name from the manifesto. At the party's founding, the congress unanimously adopted a document called the ""Déclaration de principes"" (declaration of principles) which laid out the principles and values that led the two organizations to merge. The declaration of principles does not specifically endorse social democracy, socialism or communism, although it includes certain activists and tendencies that do. The document declared: The Green Party of Quebec had tried to avoid running candidates in ridings where there was a UFP candidate, although it reserved the right to run anywhere it wants to (even ridings with a UFP candidate). However, such an arrangement will not be renewed since the Green Party has taken a new direction. The party had no official logo for several months after its formation, until the National Council adopted the logo at right in 2006. It officially adopted orange as its political colour in 2009 and adjusted its logo to match. Election results. Québec solidaire's first political venture was to field a candidate, Manon Massé, in an April 10, 2006, by-election in Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques. She received 22% of the vote. On 14 August 2006, there were two by-elections (Pointe-aux-Trembles and Taillon) in which QS received 8% and 7% of the vote. Québec solidaire contested the 2007 Quebec election. It won 3.65% of the popular vote and received 144,418 votes, 0.21% behind the Green Party of Quebec. They were also endorsed by the Montreal Central Council of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux which represents 125,000 members in Quebec. According to an analysis on ""Canadian Dimension,"" this is the first time a trade union in Quebec has endorsed a party more left-wing than the Parti Québécois. On 8 December 2008, the first Quebec Solidaire candidate was elected in the Quebec provincial election. Amir Khadir was elected in the Montreal riding of Mercier. Structure. The party's statutes call for it to be represented by a male and female co-spokesperson, one who sits in the National Assembly and one from outside it who serves the dual role as party president. They are sometimes referred to in the media as the ""de facto"" co-leaders of the party. Régent Séguin, the secretary-general, is the ""de jure"" party leader recognized by the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec. Françoise David and Amir Khadir were the two spokespersons at the party's founding. After the 2012 election where Françoise David won a seat for the first time and Amir Khadir was re-elected, Khadir stepped down as co-spokesperson so a new one could be chosen from outside the legislature. André Frappier served as interim co-spokesperson until Andrés Fontecilla was chosen on May 5, 2013 to permanently fill the role. Alexa Conradi was president from the foundation of the party until June 2009 after which Françoise David was named president-spokeswoman. As with its predecessors, Option Citoyenne and the Union des forces progressistes, the party has no ""party leader"". Instead, the duties generally entrusted to the leader are instead divided among the president, secretary general and male and female spokespeople. The party leadership is assumed by the National Coordinating Committee, composed of 16 persons elected by the founding Congress. A person from the team of volunteers will always have a seat. The national spokespersons of Québec solidaire have greater visibility than the secretary general and are best known. Françoise David has been named Personality of the Year by ""Le Point"" and Amir Khadir is known for becoming the first elected member of the party in the elections in Mercier in 2008. The basic unit of the party is the local association. There is a local association for each of the 125 ridings in Quebec. These local associations are grouped into 19 regional associations, whose primary mandate to support the establishment of local associations. In March 2007, Québec solidaire has 61 local associations organized. Students and staff at institutions of higher education are grouped in campus associations that also participate in the democratic life of the party. Two national commissions are also part of the structure of Québec solidaire: the Political Committee and the National Commission for Women. The first is composed of 14 thematic committees and is responsible for proposing a program to members. It was responsible for drafting the electoral platform of the party in general elections of 2007. The National Commission for Women is composed of delegates from each region and is responsible for ensuring that feminism is a value which transverses the party. Québec solidaire also includes a number of collectives, made up of members in good standing who may, in compliance with requirements, promote their respective political views within Québec solidaire. Unlike the UFP, these groups do not have formal representation in Congress, the National Council or other bodies of the party. Current collectives include: "

wikipedia-3983656," Matrix group  In mathematics, a matrix group is a group ""G"" consisting of invertible matrices over some field ""K"", usually fixed in advance, with operations of matrix multiplication and inversion. More generally, one can consider ""n"" × ""n"" matrices over a commutative ring ""R"". (The size of the matrices is restricted to be finite, as any group can be represented as a group of infinite matrices over any field.) A linear group is an abstract group that is isomorphic to a matrix group over a field ""K"", in other words, admitting a faithful, finite-dimensional representation over ""K"". Any finite group is linear, because it can be realized by permutation matrices using Cayley's theorem. Among infinite groups, linear groups form an interesting and tractable class. Examples of groups that are not linear include all ""sufficiently large"" groups; for example, the infinite symmetric group of permutations of an infinite set.  Basic examples. The set ""M""""R""(""n"",""n"") of ""n"" × ""n"" matrices over a commutative ring ""R"" is itself a ring under matrix addition and multiplication. The group of units of ""M""""R""(""n"",""n"") is called the general linear group of ""n"" × ""n"" matrices over the ring ""R"" and is denoted ""GL""""n""(""R"") or ""GL""(""n"",""R""). All matrix groups are subgroups of some general linear group. Classical groups. Some particularly interesting matrix groups are the so-called classical groups. When the ring of coefficients of the matrix group is the real numbers, these groups are the classical Lie groups. When the underlying ring is a finite field the classical groups are groups of Lie type. These groups play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups. Finite groups as matrix groups. Every finite group is isomorphic to some matrix group. This is similar to Cayley's theorem which states that every finite group is isomorphic to some permutation group. Since the isomorphism property is transitive one need only consider how to form a matrix group from a permutation group. Let ""G"" be a permutation group on ""n"" points (Ω = {1,2,…,n}) and let {""g""1...,""g""""k""} be a generating set for ""G"". The general linear group ""GL""""n""(C) of ""n""×""n"" matrices over the complex numbers acts naturally on the vector space C""n"". Let ""B""={""b""1,…,""b""""n""} be the standard basis for C""n"". For each ""g""""i"" let ""M""""i"" in ""GL""""n""(C) be the matrix which sends each ""b""""j"" to ""b""""g""""i""(""j""). That is, if the permutation ""g""""i"" sends the point ""j"" to ""k"" then ""M""""i"" sends the basis vector ""b""""j"" to ""b""""k"". Let ""M"" be the subgroup of ""GL""""n""(C) generated by {""M""1,…,""M""""k""}. The action of ""G"" on Ω is then precisely the same as the action of ""M"" on ""B"". It can be proved that the function taking each ""g""""i"" to ""M""""i"" extends to an isomorphism and thus every group is isomorphic to a matrix group. Note that the field (C in the above case) is irrelevant since ""M"" contains only elements with entries 0 or 1. One can just as easily perform the construction for an arbitrary field since the elements 0 and 1 exist in every field. As an example, let ""G"" = ""S""3, the symmetric group on 3 points. Let ""g""1 = (1,2,3) and ""g""2 = (1,2). Then ""M""1""b""1 = ""b""2, ""M""1""b""2 = ""b""3 and ""M""1""b""3 = ""b""1. Likewise, ""M""2""b""1 = ""b""2, ""M""2""b""2 = ""b""1 and ""M""2""b""3 = ""b""3. Representation theory and character theory. Linear transformations and matrices are (generally speaking) well-understood objects in mathematics and have been used extensively in the study of groups. In particular representation theory studies homomorphisms from a group into a matrix group and character theory studies homomorphisms from a group into a field given by the trace of a representation.

In response to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, much legislation was passed that made domestic energy production an attractive enterprise. In 1984, Peter Cartwright and four of his co-workers, the Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company of South San Francisco, and the Electrowatt corporation struck an investment arrangement and Calpine was born with initial capital of US$1 million. It was essentially a Silicon Valley startup company. The name ""Calpine"" is derived from the company's California location and alpine, a reference to the Zürich home base of Electrowatt. Calpine is the world's largest provider of geothermal energy, and largest natural gas fueled power producer in North America. As of 2011, the directors of Calpine are J.

wikipedia-3983697," Belt of Venus  The Belt of Venus or Venus's Girdle is the Victorian-era name for an atmospheric phenomenon seen at sunrise and sunset. Shortly after sunset or shortly before sunrise, the observer is, or is very nearly, surrounded by a pinkish glow (or anti-twilight arch) that extends roughly 10°–20° above the horizon. Often, the glow is separated from the horizon by a dark layer, the Earth's shadow or ""dark segment."" The Arch's light rose (pink) color is due to backscattering of reddened light from the rising or setting Sun. A very similar effect can be seen during a total solar eclipse. "
wikipedia-3983745," O. J. McDuffie  Otis James McDuffie (born December 2, 1969) is a former American college and professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons. He played college football for Penn State University, and earned All-American honors. A first-round pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the NFL's Miami Dolphins. Early years. McDuffie was born in Marion, Ohio. He attended Hawken School in Gates Mills, Ohio, excelling in football, basketball, track and field and baseball. He set Hawken's record for all-purpose yards with 7,302 in his high school career. In 1986, McDuffie returned an interception 108 yards, an unofficial Ohio state record. During his senior year in 1987, he was named the A-AA Ohio Player of the year. For the 1987 high school football season, he scored 136 points (21 touchdowns) ahead of future professional football players Desmond Howard and Robert Smith. His number 32 is retired at Hawken School and ""The News-Herald"" named McDuffie the number 3 player of the 20th century in Northeast Ohio. Memorabilia from McDuffie's days playing Marion Midget Football are featured in an exhibit entitled ""A Passion to Play"" at the Marion County Historical Society. College career. McDuffie attended Pennsylvania State University, and played for coach Joe Paterno's Penn State Nittany Lions football team. He wore the number 24 for the Nittany Lions. He set several single-season and career receiving records, as well as all-purpose yards records. His performance in Penn State's 1992 Fiesta Bowl victory over Tennessee on January 1, 1992 garnered him the game's offensive MVP. McDuffie also played one season of varsity baseball in 1990 while at Penn State. He still holds the PSU record for stolen bases in a single game with 4, and is in the top 10 for stolen bases in a single season. McDuffie was drafted by the then California Angels in the 41st round of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in labor and industrial relations from Penn State in 1992. Professional career. The Miami Dolphins selected McDuffie in the first round (25th pick overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft. He returned punts and was a reserve wide receiver before earning the starting spot for the Dolphins. During his formative years with the Dolphins, McDuffie became known as Dan Marino's favorite receiver. His 415 career catches are fourth all-time in Dolphins history. In 1998, McDuffie caught 90 passes, leading the NFL in that category. He is the only Dolphin to achieve this feat. With the exception of Mark Clayton and Mark Duper, McDuffie caught more passes thrown by Dan Marino than any other Miami Dolphin. He played his entire career in Miami, retiring in 2000 because of a nagging toe injury. Nearly ten years later, McDuffie would win a Medical malpractice lawsuit related to that career-ending toe injury. On May 5, 2010, Miami-Dade County, Florida jurors ordered a former Dolphins team physician, Dr. John Uribe, to pay McDuffie $11.5 million in damages. The lawsuit alleged Uribe told McDuffie he was safe to continue playing football, despite MRIs showing damage to the tendons in his toe. On September 30, 2010, Judge Michael Genden of Miami-Dade County tossed out that verdict due to the improper use of a medical manual as evidence. The judge also ordered a new trial. Life after football. McDuffie was formerly a radio personality for WAXY, an AM sports radio station in South Florida and is now a sports blogger at OPENSports.com. He is also the founder and chairman of the Catch 81 Foundation, an organization created to raise money for children's charitable causes in the South Florida metropolitan area. "
wikipedia-3983746," John Yarmuth  John Allan Yarmuth (born November 4, 1947) is the U.S. Representative for , serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party and a former member of the Republican Party. Early life, education and career. Yarmuth was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Edna E. (née Klein) and Stanley R. Yarmuth. He is descended from Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria. He graduated from Atherton High School. He then graduated from Yale University, majoring in American Studies. After working for U.S. Senator Marlow Cook from 1971 to 1975, he returned to Louisville to begin his publishing career when he founded the ""Louisville Today"" magazine (1976–1982). He later worked as a vice-president of University Relations at the University of Louisville. Prior to his election to Congress, Yarmuth was best known for founding the weekly paper, ""Louisville Eccentric Observer"" (LEO), in 1990 and for writing a progressive-oriented weekly political column that was featured on the first page of most issues. Yarmuth sold LEO in 2003 to a company owned by Times Publishing Company of Pennsylvania, owner of the ""Erie Times-News"", though Yarmuth remained on board as a columnist and consultant until January 2006, when he declared he was running for Congress and his column was put on hold. U.S. House of Representatives. Tenure. Yarmuth took office on January 3, 2007 and is currently serving his fourth term as Congressman. Following his first year in Congress, Yarmuth donated his entire post-tax congressional salary of just over $120,000 to various charities in Louisville.  On February 8, 2008, Yarmuth endorsed Barack Obama in his bid for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. On September 29, 2008, Yarmuth voted against the TARP bailout plan, as negotiated by Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Republican President George W. Bush, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. However, he did vote in favor of the second version of the bailout bill. Yarmuth said he was so “nauseated” by a moment of silence for Michael Jackson on the House floor that he left the chamber. “I thought it was outrageous,” he said. “In my two and a half years, we've not done this for anybody else. We've done it for former members and that's about it.”  After defeating Northup for the second time, Yarmuth was rewarded by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee with a spot on the influential Ways and Means Committee. On the committee, Yarmuth was able to take up issues on which he actively campaigned prior to the 2008 general election. Social Security, pension, Medicare, and Medicaid issues all fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. At a September 2009 town hall meeting, constituents were unhappy with Yarmuth's decision to support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. “Yarmuth stayed calm in the face of boos and catcalls from some in the audience” according to an Associated Press report. “He warned that the current health care system is an unsustainable drain on businesses and the nation's economy.”  In 2011, Yarmuth introduced a bill alongside Republican Congressman Walter Jones that would seek to overturn key parts of the controversial Citizens United court case. The legislation would also give Congress the power to enact mandatory public financing for Congressional candidates and create a national holiday for voting purposes. In 2011, Yarmuth voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 due to a controversial provision which allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. Political campaigns. 2006. Yarmuth filed candidacy papers on January 31, 2006, to represent . Having won the Democratic primary on May 16, defeating Andrew Horne, Burrell Charles Farnsley and James W. Moore, he defeated incumbent Anne Northup (R) in November of that year. On August 7, 2006, ""The Courier-Journal"" reported that ""The Hill"" revealed a week before that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had earmarked $51.5 million for television advertising in 32 congressional districts across the nation, but none for Yarmuth's challenge in the Third Congressional District. On October 20, a ""Courier-Journal"" article stated that a WHAS11/SurveyUSA poll revealed the race had tightened dramatically, with Yarmuth leading Northup 48 to 47 percent. Another poll a month earlier had Northup leading by 6 points. A WHAS11/SurveyUSA poll released on November 2 showed Yarmuth leading Northup 52 to 44 percent. On October 26, Yarmuth told ""Courier-Journal"" reporter Kay Stewart that he would donate his congressional salary—which would be $168,500 in 2007—to local charity. Because polls close early in Kentucky, many analysts saw this race as a key indicator and it immediately became one of the most watched House races in the nation. Yarmuth defeated Northup in the general election. He garnered 122,139 votes (51%) to Northup's 116,157 votes (48%). Independent candidates garnered 2,896 votes (1%). 2008. Yarmuth ran unopposed in the primary, and faced Anne Northup in a rematch of the 2006 general election. Yarmuth won the 2008 election with 59% of the vote. 2010. Yarmuth was challenged by Republican Todd Lally and Independent Michael D. Hansen. Yarmuth was re-elected successfully. 2012. Yarmuth was challenged by Republican Brooks Wicker and was re-elected successfully. Television. In 2003, Yarmuth and former WHAS-AM radio talk show host John Ziegler debated political issues on the weekly WAVE program ""Yarmuth & Ziegler"", with Yarmuth taking the liberal side and Ziegler, the conservative side. On a successor program, ""Hot Button"", which ran from September 2004 to December 2005, he faced off with conservative Jim Milliman. Yarmuth appeared on the March 8, 2007, episode of ""The Colbert Report"" in the show's ""Better Know a District"" series. In a parody of Yarmuth's former ""Yarmuth & Ziegler"" debate series, host Stephen Colbert prodded Yarmuth into a point/counterpoint style debate. After agreeing to the ""debate,"" Colbert forced Yarmuth to defend the shredding of kittens in wood chippers, which Yarmuth gamely proceeded to do. Colbert referred to Yarmuth as a real life Bruce Wayne, and presented him with a framed print of his congressional photo with a Batman mask photoshopped over his face. Personal life. Yarmuth has served on many boards including the Bingham Child Guidance Center and Kentucky Country Day School. He is Kentucky's first Jewish congressman. Yarmuth and his wife, Cathy Yarmuth, have one son, Aaron, who is a graduate of Kentucky Country Day. "
wikipedia-3983802," Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania  The transcontinental Interstate 80 is designated across northern Pennsylvania as the Keystone Shortway, officially the Z.H. Confair Memorial Highway. This route was built mainly along a completely new alignment, not paralleling any earlier U.S. Routes, as a shortcut to the tolled Pennsylvania Turnpike and New York State Thruway. It does not serve any major cities in Pennsylvania, and serves mainly as a cross-state route on the Ohio-New York City corridor. Most of I-80's path across the state goes through hilly and mountainous terrain, with relatively flat areas playing home to the freeway toward the western tier of the state. Route description. Interstate 80 intersects cities such as DuBois, Sharon, Hazleton, Stroudsburg, and many other cities. Western Pennsylvania. I-80 enters the Western Pennsylvania area which encompasses Mercer, Venango, Butler, Clarion, Jefferson, and Clearfield Counties from the state of Ohio. I-80 intersects I-376 (serving the Pittsburgh International Airport and on to Downtown Pittsburgh) and I-79 (serving Erie to the north and Pittsburgh to the south) in Mercer County in Shenango and Findley Township respectively. It briefly traverses the extreme northern end of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area when it travels through Butler County. Jefferson County at mile marker 73 is known for the city of Punxsutawney, the location of the famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil who predicts the weather on Groundhog Day. In Clearfield County, I-80 reaches its highest elevation east of the Mississippi River, , although other interstate highways east of the Mississippi, including I-26 in North Carolina and Tennessee, reach higher elevations. This point is just east of Exit 111. A sign prominently displays this unusual fact about the Interstate. At mile marker 101, I-80 passes by the city of Dubois. Centre, Clinton, and Union Counties. I-80 enters Centre County around mile marker 147 and intersects I-99 at exit 161, the main connecting point to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76 and I-70) and the Pennsylvania State University. US 220 is concurrent between exits 161 and 178 where it heads towards Lock Haven. At mile marker 199, I-80 approaches the Williamsport area, the venue of the Little League World Series in Union County. I-80 intersects I-180 at exit 212. Northeastern Pennsylvania. I-80 enters the Northeastern Pennsylvania area to include points Northumberland County and east to New Jersey. In Montour County at mile marker 224, it approaches the Bloomsburg area, home to the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, which is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. I-80 also passes by the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area in Luzerne County. At exit 260, a connection can be made via I-81 to Harrisburg to the south and Binghamton, NY to the north.  I-80 intersects I-476 at exit 274 in Carbon County for connections to Allentown and Philadelphia to the south and I-380 for a connection to I-84 to New England and Scranton. Around mile marker 305, I-80 approaches Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg, home to the East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania and the ski resort areas generally known as the Poconos. After passing by the Delaware Water Gap, I-80 enters the state of New Jersey via the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. History. The corridor now served by I-80 was originally to be a branch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from Sharon to Stroudsburg. Planning was shifted to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1956 with the passage of the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act. In early plans for the Interstate Highway System, the connection across northern Pennsylvania would have paralleled U.S. Route 6N and U.S. Route 6 from what became Interstate 90 near West Springfield, Pennsylvania east to Scranton. (From Scranton east to Hartford, Connecticut, Interstate 84 was built parallel to US 6.) From Scranton a route went southeast along U.S. Route 611 to the Stroudsburg area, and then east along U.S. Route 46 to near New York City. On May 22, 1957, a request by Pennsylvania to move the corridor south was approved by the Federal Highway Administration. (The Scranton-Stroudsburg connection was kept, and the new alignment merged with it west of Stroudsburg.) However, when the initial numbers were assigned later that year, they were drawn on a 1947 map, and so the corridor across northern Pennsylvania became part of Interstate 84, while the Scranton-New York route became Interstate 82. (I-80 ran along the Pennsylvania Turnpike - later Interstate 80S - to Harrisburg, where it split into I-80S to Philadelphia and I-80N (later Interstate 78) to New York.) This was corrected the next year, as the Keystone Shortway became part of I-80, and the southern route became I-80S (later I-76) and I-78. I-84 was truncated to Scranton, and the Scranton-Stroudsburg connection became Interstate 81E (later renumbered Interstate 380). The first section of present I-80 to open was the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge, opened December 16, 1953. This had been built as part of U.S. Route 611 and connected back to its old alignment soon after crossing into Pennsylvania. Construction on the rest of I-80 began in 1959 and was completed in 1970. In 1993, exit 43 (now exit 284) of I-80, which serves the Pocono Raceway, was designated the Richard Petty Interchange in honor of the NASCAR legend that drove the #43 car. On March 7, 2011, the supporting wall on the eastbound I-80 bridge over Sullivan Trail in Tannersville collapsed from snow and rain. As a result, eastbound I-80 was reduced to one lane and Sullivan Trail was closed. Toll proposal. In an effort to keep the Pennsylvania Turnpike system under public control, in June 2007, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission proposed tolling Interstate 80 as a means of raising transportation revenue. It is seeking the permission to put tolls on the highway through a Federal Highway Administration pilot program that allows three states to place tolls on interstates. Missouri's Interstate 70 and Virginia had already taken two of the spots. Under the plan, the PTC would assume all maintenance and toll-taking operations on I-80. The plan calls for up to ten toll plazas along the length of I-80 in Pennsylvania with a toll rate of 8 cents per mile, which would be comparable to the rate on the Pennsylvania Turnpike following a projected toll increase. Originally, I-80 was part of the PTC's 1,000 Mile Turnpike system, but with the passage of the Interstate Highway Act in 1954, the PTC abandoned the system and only maintained the original east–west Turnpike and its Northeastern Extension. Currently the only toll on I-80 in Pennsylvania is at the Delaware Water Gap bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Tolling on I-80 would be completed by 2010. On October 15, 2007, the lease for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to toll I-80 was signed. This plan faced opposition from Northern Pennsylvania politicians who fear tolls will hurt the economy in the region and who do not want their tolls going toward funding mass transit. Congressmen John E. Peterson and Phil English have proposed a federal transportation bill that would ban the tolling of I-80. The chief executive officer of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission has promised that the tolls would be used on highway projects in Pennsylvania and not on mass transit. On December 12, 2007, the FHWA rejected the plan, and returned Pennsylvania's application for tolling I-80 with questions asking why the state should place tolls on the highway. On September 11, 2008, the Federal Highway Administration rejected Pennsylvania's application to toll Interstate 80 for the second time. On April 6, 2010, the Federal Highway Administration rejected this application for the third time. "
wikipedia-3983860," Cliff Compton  Clifford ""Cliff"" Compton (born November 2, 1979) is an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Domino. Best known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), he works on the independent circuit for promotions including Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Compton was assigned to WWE's developmental territory OVW in Louisville, Kentucky in 2005. While situated at OVW, he wrestled under the name Dice Domino and was placed in tag team competition, alongside Deuce Shade. Together, the pair won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. It was also during this time that he and Deuce, alongside their manager Cherry, were known as ""The Throw-Backs"" and later as ""The Untouchables"". The team's name was changed to Deuce 'n Domino for their main roster debut in January 2007, as part of the SmackDown! brand. Three months later, Deuce 'n Domino went onto win the WWE Tag Team Championship. The team lost the title in August 2007. The group disbanded in June 2008, after a series of losses. After the split, Compton played an enhancement talent on ""SmackDown!"". Following his release from WWE in August 2008, he wrestled on the independent circuit. Professional wrestling career. Early career. Compton began his professional wrestling career after being trained in Larry Sharpe's Monster Factory. Compton became a regular for World Xtreme Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with Jake Bishop, known as Double Threat. On July 11, 2003, the duo won the WXW Tag Team Championship. He also wrestled a dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. World Wrestling Entertainment. Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005-2007). On September 26, 2005, Compton was defeated by Danny Basham in a dark match prior to ""WWE Raw"" and was soon signed by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Upon signing with WWE, Compton was sent to the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) developmental territory. After four months at OVW, Compton began working as ""Dice Domino"", teaming with Deuce Shade under the management of his storyline sister Cherry Pie, using a 1950s greaser in-ring persona, forming the faction ""The Throw-Backs"". During their time together they would undergo an image change, including changing the group's name to ""The Untouchables"" and dropping Dice, Shade, and Pie from their respective names. On March 19, the team would become OVW Southern Tag Team Champions after Deuce defeated The Miz in a singles match after Miz's partner, Chris Cage, left the organization and forced The Miz to defend the title on his own. The Untouchables lost their titles on April 5, in a three-way match to Roadkill and Kasey James, which also involved Kenny and Mikey of the Spirit Squad. The group soon began a scripted rivalry with the team of CM Punk and Seth Skyfire before later engaging into a long and heated rivalry with Sean Spears and Cody Runnels, which even saw Cherry leave The Untouchables to side with Spears and Runnels briefly before betraying them. The feud culminated in a street fight between the two teams, with Spears and Runnels winning the match. The Untouchables would go on to win the OVW Tag Team Title another two times, as well as the DSW Tag Team Championship once in October 2006, before being called up to the main WWE roster in January 2007. SmackDown! (2007-2008). In their first match with WWE, where they debuted on the SmackDown! brand, the team's name was changed again, this time to ""Deuce 'n Domino."" They debuted on the January 19, 2007 episode, where they were placed in a tag team match, in which Deuce 'n Domino won. On the February 2 episode of ""SmackDown!"", the team defeated the then-WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a non-title match. Deuce 'n Domino faced London and Kendrick in a WWE Tag Team Championship match at February's pay-per-view event, No Way Out. At the event, they lost when Kendrick pinned Deuce via a roll-up. On the April 20 episode of ""SmackDown!"", they defeated London and Kendrick for the WWE Tag Team Championship when London was, in storyline, injured after missing a moonsault to the outside. Kendrick was left to defend the title by himself, and was pinned after being hit with the West Side Stomp, a finishing move performed by Deuce 'n Domino. Three weeks later, London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor. Deuce 'n Domino interfered, causing Regal and Taylor to be disqualified. This made both teams number one contenders leading to a triple threat tag team match the following week where Deuce 'n Domino retained the tag title. During a tag team match with Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and Jayson Paul) in late June, Domino suffered an injury, which was diagnosed as a broken nose and a possible broken orbital bone socket in his eye. The injury would keep him out of the ring for a month. After coming back from his injury, Deuce 'n Domino engaged in short rivalries with Batista, and Ric Flair. On the August 31 episode of ""SmackDown!"", he and Deuce lost their tag team championship to Matt Hardy and the reigning United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter. During the last few months of 2007, Deuce 'n Domino had short scripted rivalries with Hardy and MVP, Jimmy Wang Yang and Shannon Moore, Jesse and Festus, and Finlay and Hornswoggle. At the beginning of 2008, the team suffered a series of losses. At WrestleMania XXIV in March, Deuce and Domino competed as singles competitors in a 24-man Interpromotional Battle Royal, in which the winner would face then ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero later that night; however, neither was able to win the match. On the May 23 episode of ""SmackDown"", Deuce 'n Domino parted ways with Cherry; WWE Diva Maryse would take over as the team's on-screen manager. On the June 20, 2008 episode of ""SmackDown"", following a loss to Jesse and Festus, their second straight loss in two weeks, Deuce and Domino fought after the match, ending with Deuce laying out Domino with the Crack 'em in da Mouth. Deuce then threw his jacket over Domino, dissolving their partnership. The split was then further cemented when Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft. Following the draft, Domino was predominantly featured as an enhancement talent on ""SmackDown"" weekly. Domino's last television appearance was on the August 1 episode of ""SmackDown"", when he suffered a loss to The Big Show. Compton was then released from his WWE contract on August 8, 2008. Florida Championship Wrestling (2010). In 2010, Compton returned to WWE and was sent to Florida Championship Wrestling where he wrestled under his real name of Cliff Compton. His first match came on February 18, where he took on the FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion Justin Gabriel but would lose via DQ. Later in the night, Compton and Wade Barrett lost to Gabriel and Michael Tarver. He would go on to have one more match before leaving WWE. Return to OVW (2010–present). Compton returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling in September 2010, using the ring name ""Mr. Media"" Cliff Compton. After a four month undefeated streak, on January 8, 2011, Compton defeated then–champion ""Low Rider"" Matt Barela and Mike Mondo in a three-way match to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Two months later on March 5, the three faced off for the championship again, this time in a ladder match, which Mondo won. During the match, Compton suffered a broken ankle, torn ligaments, and a strained calf muscle. Compton regained the OVW Heavyweight Championship on May 14, when he defeated Mondo in a Brass Knuckles on a Pole match for the vacant championship. He lost the title to Elvis Pridemoore, following interference from Mondo, just eleven days later. On January 25, Compton's profile was removed from OVW's website, signalling his departure from the company. On May 12, 2012, Compton returned to OVW in a dark match with Mike Mondo going up against Raphael Constantine and Sean Casey. On May 31, Compton wrestled a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), losing to Crimson. On October 17, Compton won the OVW Television Championship from Alex Silva. He held the championship for three weeks, before it was vacated due to Compton suffering an injury. Following his return from injury, he defeated Jamin Olivencia to regain the championship on January 5, 2013. Following a two-month reign, he lost the championship to Rockstar Spud on March 13. Ring of Honor (2013). On March 2, 2013, Compton made his debut for Ring of Honor (ROH) at their 11th Anniversary Show iPPV, where he, Jimmy Rave, Matt Hardy and Rhett Titus, revealed themselves as the newest members of S.C.U.M. by attacking numerous members of the ROH roster following the main event, joining Kevin Steen, Jimmy Jacobs, Rhino and Steve Corino as members of the group. After Steen lost the ROH World Championship, Compton and the rest of S.C.U.M turned on Steen and made Steve Corino the new leader. At Best in the World 2013, Compton and Rhett Titus lost a three-way tag team match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On June 23, S.C.U.M. was forced to disband, after being defeated by Team ROH in a Steel Cage Warfare match. "

wikipedia-3984024," 1782 Edict of Tolerance  The 1782 Edict of Tolerance was a religious reform of Joseph II during the time he was emperor of the Habsburg Monarchy as part of his policy of Josephinism, a series of drastic reforms to remodel Austria in the form of the ideal Enlightened state. Joseph II's enlightened despotism included the Patent of Toleration, enacted in 1781, and the Edict of Tolerance in 1782. The Patent of Toleration granted religious freedom to the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Greek Orthodox, but it wasn't until the 1782 Edict of Tolerance that Joseph II extended religious freedom to the Jewish population. Austria has had a long history on the subject of religious tolerance. This can be traced back to the 16th century when Martin Luther’s writings first appeared in the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. The appearance of Luther’s writings was threatening since they encouraged religious dissent of the Catholic faith, and its ecclesiastical system. Joseph II was also inspired by economic motives, as the emigration of the Protestant population out of Austria would have eventually lead up to an economic slump. 1781 Patent of Toleration. The 1781 Patent of Toleration allowed certain rights and recognized the existence of non-Catholic religions in Austria. The Edict of Toleration allowed Protestants from other countries where religious tolerance was not enforced to immigrate to Austria and hold jobs such as pharmacists, carpenters and blacksmiths. The tolerated religions, however, were allowed to have congregations no larger than 100 people in a private home. If a certain sect had more than 100 families living in an area, they were allowed to build a church only if the church did not have a direct entrance from the street and had no visible appearance of being a church. When it came to the case of mixed marriages, there were also laws that had to be followed: if a Catholic man had children with a non-Catholic woman, all the children would be raised Catholic. In the case of a Catholic woman with a non-Catholic man, the girls would be raised Catholic while the boys would be raised non-Catholic. Scrutiny from Catholic officials occurred in places, like Bohemia, where the officials attempted to preserve religious unity. In order to do this they had printed out all the pamphlets that described this edict in German. The population whom this would affect, however, generally couldn't speak or read German. Serbian Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik translated and published the tolerance patent in Serbian which meant for the equal rights for both members of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church in Sremski Karlovci. Jewish community before the Edict. Long before the Jews had been granted religious freedom by Joseph II, they were treated rather harshly by his mother, Maria Theresa and had been ostracized by others. During the Middle Ages, Austrian Jews had lived apart from the Orthodox communities and had not been allowed by the government to own immovable property. Although this was not the case for the more affluent Jews, those who were wealthy and were able to establish factories were recipients of preferential treatment by Maria Theresa, but otherwise there were restrictions on the rest of the Jewish population. Joseph II was the first one who made an attempt to eliminate these attitudes and sanctions that were toward the majority of the Jewish population. 1782 Edict of Tolerance. The 1782 Edict of Tolerance was issued on January 2, 1782. The Edict was initially put into effect in lower Austria. The prologue to the resolution stated “This policy paper aims at making the Jewish population useful to the state."" This second edict allowed Jewish children to attend schools and universities. It allowed adults to engage in jobs such as being merchants or to open factories. It also eliminated previous restrictions, which had forced the Jews to wear gold stars or to pay a tax that was only levied on the Jews and cattle. According to the edict, however, the Jewish languages, the written language Hebrew and the spoken language Yiddish, were to be replaced by the national language of the country. Official documents and school textbooks could not be printed in Hebrew. "
wikipedia-3984093," Ramelteon  Ramelteon, marketed as Rozerem by Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, is the first in a new class of sleep agents that selectively binds to the MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), instead of binding to GABA A receptors, such as with drugs like zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon. Ramelteon is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term use. Ramelteon does not show any appreciable binding to GABAA receptors, which are associated with anxiolytic, myorelaxant, and amnesic effects. Uses. Rozerem (ramelteon), FDA Approved 07.04.05, can be used for insomnia, particularly delayed sleep onset. Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse, and the withdrawal and rebound insomnia that is typical with GABA modulators is not present in ramelteon. Some clinicians also use ramelteon for the treatment of Delayed sleep phase syndrome. Mechanism of action. Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and selectivity over the MT3 receptor. Ramelteon demonstrates full agonist activity in vitro in cells expressing human MT1 or MT2 receptors, and high selectivity for human MT1 and MT2 receptors compared to the MT3 receptor. The activity of ramelteon at the MT1 and MT2 receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle. Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates. Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel. The significance of ramelteon's lack of affinity for the MT3 receptor is not clear, despite the manufacturer's emphasis of this fact in commercial advertisements. The MT3 receptor appears almost exclusively in the gut and might not have any relationship to sleep or wakefulness. The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1 and MT2 receptors, respectively, and is 17 – 25-fold less potent than ramelteon in ""in vitro"" functional assays. Although the potency of M-II at MT1 and MT2 receptors is lower than the parent drug, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20 – 100 fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. M-II has weak affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, but no appreciable affinity for other receptors or enzymes. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes. All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive. No published studies have indicated whether ramelteon, in humans, is more or less safe or effective than the hormone melatonin which it mimics; melatonin is much less expensive and is widely available over-the-counter in the US and Canada. The biological action of melatonin is similar to that of ramelteon. Ramelteon has been directly compared to melatonin in cats, and Ramelteon had a significant (3x) longer effect and had a more profound effect on the EEG of the sleeping cats. Clinical efficacy. In a double-blind multicenter trial, ramelteon did reduce the time to fall asleep by approximately 15–20 minutes, at 8 mg and 16 mg doses after four weeks compared to placebo (approx. 29-32 versus 48 minutes) Total sleep time improved about 40 minutes, however, this was identical to improvement with placebo at the end of trial. Subjective reported sleep time was greater in ramelteon treated persons. Ramelteon, when compared to placebo, had a much faster onset of effects: one or two weeks. However, the effects were roughly equivalent to placebo at four weeks. Adverse effects. Ramelteon caused hyperprolactinaemia two to three times more often than placebo in clinical trials. Studies of rats and mice showed a dose-dependent increase in cancer. The long-term safety in humans is unknown. Ramelteon was teratogenic in rats. Drug interactions. Ramelteon has been evaluated for potential drug interactions with the following medications and showed no significant effects: omeprazole, theophylline, dextromethorphan, and midazolam, digoxin and warfarin. There were no clinically meaningful effects when ramelteon was coadministered with any of these drugs. A drug interaction study showed that there were no clinically meaningful effects or an increase in adverse events when ramelteon and the SSRI Prozac (fluoxetine) were coadministered. Ramelteon and fluvoxamine should not be coadministered. Ramelteon should be administered with caution in patients taking other CYP1A2 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, and strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon is used in combination with potent CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin, since ramelteon concentrations may be decreased. "

wikipedia-3984134," 28th Canadian Ministry  The Twenty-Eighth Canadian Ministry is the combined Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Ministers that have governed Canada since the beginning of the 39th Parliament. Its original members were sworn into the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on February 6, 2006, exactly two weeks after the 2006 election, and nine weeks and six days after the end of the 38th Canadian Parliament. Smaller than its recent predecessors, the Conservative Cabinet originally consisted of 27 members, including the prime minister. On January 4, 2007, five Secretaries of State were added to the ministry who are not members of the Cabinet itself. Only 24 of the original members were elected to serve as Conservative Members of Parliament (MP) in 2006; Senator Marjory LeBreton is the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The other two choices that raised some controversy were David Emerson, who was elected as a Liberal, but crossed the floor between the election and the swearing-in of the Cabinet to serve as Minister of International Trade, of the Pacific Gateway, and of the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics, and Michael Fortier, a Montreal-area member of the former Progressive Conservatives and co-chair of the Conservatives' 2006 federal campaign, who was not elected as an MP but was named a Senator on February 27, 2006, and subsequently served as Minister of Public Works and Government Services. The reason given for the appointments of Emerson and Fortier was that the Conservatives were completely shut out of the three most populous cities in Canada – Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. The Liberals were the only party to win seats in all three, with the Bloc represented in Montreal and the NDP in Toronto and Vancouver. Emerson's riding is Vancouver Kingsway, and Fortier lives and works in the Montreal-Laval area, and ran for the riding of Laval West for the Tories in 2000. The only major city this left out was Toronto, although the Conservatives have indicated that they consider that enough Cabinet Ministers are from the Greater Toronto Area, including Jim Flaherty and Bev Oda, to adequately represent the city in Cabinet. Contrary to precedent, Harper did not name a Deputy Prime Minister, confounding rumours that Quebec lieutenant Lawrence Cannon or Conservative deputy leader Peter MacKay might be awarded the honorary post. Harper's explanation was that, instead, any replacement Prime Minister would be named as required and this assignment could be conferred upon different ministers. List of Ministers. By minister.

wikipedia-3984207," Dustin Penner  Dustin Penner (born September 28, 1982) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Penner was not drafted by an NHL team; in 2004 he was signed as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim after playing college hockey for the University of Maine in the NCAA. Penner won the Stanley Cup in his first full season with the (renamed) Anaheim Ducks in 2007, adding a second Stanley Cup in his first full season with the Los Angeles Kings in 2012. Playing career. Minors and collegiate. Growing up in Winkler, Manitoba, Penner played for his high school hockey team, the Garden Valley Zodiacs. After high school he was cut by many minor hockey teams, including his local junior club three times.  With little hope of ever playing hockey professionally, Penner agreed to play with Minot State University-Bottineau, now known as Dakota College at Bottineau, but immediately broke his femur, ending his first year with the club. The next year, in the 2001-02 season, he became a very important player for Bottineau, scoring 20 goals with 13 assists in 23 games, also earning the Most Determined Player Award for his improvement and stellar play after recovering from his injury. Penner then went to an evaluation camp at Saskatoon. He played well there, scoring an average of three points per game. He was scouted by Grant Standbrook, the assistant coach for the University of Maine, and was offered a scholarship, which he accepted. Although he did not initially join the team, in the 2003–04 season he helped lead the Black Bears and to the NCAA Championship game, scoring the game-winning goal in the semifinals against Boston College. Maine then lost the championship title game to the University of Denver 1-0. Anaheim Ducks. Penner was signed as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks on May 12, 2004 to a three-year entry-level contract. He was assigned to the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, Anaheim's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. He recorded 28 points in his professional rookie season with Cincinnati, then took a major step the next season as he was moved to the Portland Pirates, who became the Mighty Ducks' AHL affiliate in 2005–06. He scored 39 goals and 84 points in 57 games with Portland while also making his NHL debut, appearing in 19 games with the Mighty Ducks that season. He was originally called up on November 23, 2005, being sent back and forth from the minors. During the Mighty Ducks' 2006 playoff run, Penner scored 9 points in 13 games until Anaheim was eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference Finals. Penner earned a full-time roster spot with the Ducks in 2006–07 and broke out with 29 goals and 45 points playing with Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry on a unit dubbed the ""Kid Line"". Penner's goal total was the second highest on the team, only trailing superstar Teemu Selänne. He also set the Ducks' franchise rookie record for most points (surpassed by Bobby Ryan in 2008–09). During the Ducks' 2007 Stanley Cup run, Penner scored the game-winner in Game 1 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the Minnesota Wild and Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Ottawa Senators. In Game 5, Penner and the Ducks defeated the Senators 6-2 to win the Stanley Cup. Penner became the first former Maine Black Bear to win the Stanley Cup as a player. Edmonton Oilers. After winning the Stanley Cup with the Ducks, Penner's entry-level deal expired and he became a restricted free agent in the off-season. With the Ducks dealing with salary cap issues and the signing of Todd Bertuzzi, Edmonton Oilers general manager Kevin Lowe jumped at the opportunity and signed Penner to a five-year, $21.25 million offer sheet. Lowe was criticized by the media and specifically Ducks' general manager Brian Burke. After seven days had passed, the Ducks were ultimately unwilling to match the offer and Penner became an Oiler. To date, Penner is the most recent player to change teams via an offer sheet. In his first season with the Oilers, Penner scored a team-high 23 goals and improved to 47 points. He then began the 2008–09 season with a slow start and was publicly criticized by head coach Craig MacTavish for a lack of fitness and competitiveness after being made a healthy scratch for the second consecutive game. Penner was confirmed to be a part of a planned summertime 2009 blockbuster trade that would see Andrew Cogliano, Ladislav Smid, and himself dealt to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for disgruntled All-Star forward Dany Heatley. In the end, Heatley exercised the no-trade clause contained in his contract and the deal could not be finalized (Heatley would, shortly after, accept a trade to the San Jose Sharks). Penner got off to a good start in 2009-10 NHL Season and was fourth in NHL scoring with 11 goals and 11 assists after 18 games played. On October 22, for the first time in his career, he scored 5 points (2 Goals, 3 Assists), in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. His linemates for that game were Ales Hemsky (1 Goal, 4 Assists) and Sam Gagner (1 Goal, 2 Assists). At season's end, the Oilers had finished last overall in the league, but Penner had recorded career highs in goals (32) and points (63). Los Angeles Kings. On February 28, 2011, Penner was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Colten Teubert, a first round draft pick in 2011 (Oscar Klefbom), as well as a conditional third round pick in 2012 (Daniil Zharkov). On May 22, 2012, Penner scored the winning goal in overtime in game 5 against the Phoenix Coyotes to advance the Los Angeles Kings to the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals.

wikipedia-3984443," Çeşme  Çeşme is a coastal town and the administrative centre of the district of the same name in Turkey's westernmost end, on a promontory on the tip of the peninsula which also carries the same name and which extends inland to form a whole with the wider Karaburun Peninsula. It is a popular holiday resort and the district center, where two thirds of the district population is concentrated. Çeşme is located 85 km. west of İzmir, the largest metropolitan center in Turkey's Aegean Region. There is a six-lane highway connecting the two cities (Otoyol 32). Çeşme district has two neighboring districts, Karaburun to the north and Urla to the east, both of which are also part of İzmir Province. The name ""Çeşme"" means ""fountain"" and possibly draws reference from the many Ottoman fountains scattered across the city. Name. Its name in Classical antiquity was ""Kysos"" (Κύσος) under the Greeks , ""Kysus"" under the Romans, possibly a mere locality at the time. The name Kysos is nevertheless associated with Homer since the king Rhesus of Thrace, ally of the Trojans during the Trojan War and slain together with twelve of his men by Diomedes who had plotted with Odysseus to steal the magnificent horses of the Thracians, had his wife Argantona (sometimes also spelled as ""Argantone""), a mythical beauty and a master of animals like her husband, who inhabited the forests of Kysos. Turkish sources always cited the town and the region as ""Çeşme"" since the first settlement 2 km south of the present-day center (""Çeşmeköy"") founded by Tzachas and pursued for some time by his brother Yalvaç before an interlude until the 14th century. The region. A prized location of country houses and secondary residences especially for the well-to-do inhabitants of İzmir since more than a century, Çeşme perked up considerably in recent decades to become one of Turkey's most prominent centers of international tourism. Many hotels, marinas, clubs, restaurants, boutique hotels, family accommodation possibilities (""pansiyon"") and other facilities for visitors are found in Çeşme center and in its surrounding towns and villages and the countryside, as well as very popular beaches. Çeşme district has one depending township with own municipal administration, Alaçatı, where tourism is an equally important driving force as the district center area and which offers its own arguments for attracting visitors, as well as four villages: Ildırı on the coast towards the north, which is notable for being the location of ancient Erythrae, and three others which are more in the background, in terms both of their geographical location and renown: Germiyan, Karaköy and Ovacık, where agriculture and livestock breeding still forms the backbone of the economy. Some andesite, lime and marble is also being quarried in Çeşme area, while the share of industrial activities in the economy remains negligible. In terms of livestock, an ovine breed known as """"Sakız koyunu"""" in Turkish (""translatable literally as ""Chios Sheep""""), more probably a crossbreeding between that island's sheep and breeds from Anatolia, is considered in Turkey as native to Çeşme region where it yields the highest levels of productivity in terms of their meat, their milk, their fleece and the number of lambs they produce.  Preparations such as jam, ice cream and desserts, and even sauces for fish preparations, based on the distinctively flavored resin of the tree ""pistachia lentiscus"" from which it is harvested, are among nationally known culinary specialties of Çeşme. The adjacent Greek island of Chios (sakız in Turkish is the name for both Chios and mastic resin) is the source of mastic resin. Some efforts to produce mastic resin in Çeşme,where ecological conditions are similar, were not continued. A number of efforts are being made to rehabilitate the potential presented by the mastic trees that presently grow in the wilderness, and to increase the number of cultivated trees, especially those planted by secondary-residence owners who grow them as a hobby activity. The fish is also abundant both in variety and quantity along Çeşme district's coastline. In relation to tourism, it is common for the resorts along Çeşme district's 90 km coastline to be called by the name of their beaches or coves or the visitor's facilities and attractions they offer, as in Şifne (""Ilıca""), famous both for its thermal baths and beach, and in Çiftlikköy (""Çatalazmak""), Dalyanköy, Reisdere, Küçükliman, Paşalimanı, Ayayorgi, Kocakarı, Kum, Mavi and Pırlanta beaches; Altunyunus, synonymous with a large hotel located in its cove; and Tursite, by the name of the villas located there. Some of these localities may not be shown on a map of administrative divisions The district area as a whole is one of the spots in Turkey where foreign purchases of real estate are concentrated at the highest levels. The town of Çeşme lies across a strait facing the Greek island of Chios, which is at a few miles' distance and there are regular ferry connections between the two centers, as well as larger ferries from and to Italy (Brindisi, Ancona and Bari) used extensively by Turks of Germany returning for their summer holidays. The town. The town itself dominated by Çeşme Castle. While the castle is recorded to have been considerably extended and strengthened during the reign of Ottoman sultan Bayezid II, sources differ as to their citation of the original builders, whether the Genoese or the Turks at an earlier time after the early 15th century capture. A statue of Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha, one of the naval commanders of the Battle of Chesma is in front of the castle and the Pasha is depicted caressing his famous pet lion and facing the town square. The battle itself, although ended in Ottoman defeat, had seen Hasan Pasha pulling out honorably after having sunk the Russian flagship Sv. Evstafii, together with his own ship, after which he had to follow the main battle from the coast before joining the capital by way of land, where he rapidly rose to become a distinguished grand vizier. A few paces south of the castle, there is an Ottoman caravanserai built in the early centuries of the Ottoman conquest in 1528 by order of Süleyman the Magnificent, and it is now restored and transformed into a boutique hotel. The imposing but redundant 19th century Greek Orthodox church of Ayios Haralambos is used for temporary exhibitions. Along some of the back streets of the town are old traditional Ottoman houses, as well as Sakız house-type residences of more peculiar lines, for the interest of strollers. Ilıca. Ilıca is a large resort area 5 km east of Çeşme to which it is attached administratively, although it bears aspects of a township apart in many of its characteristics. It is famed for its thermal springs, which is the very meaning of its name. Ilıca started out as a distinct settlement towards the end of the 19th century, initially as a retreat for wealthy people, especially from İzmir and during summer holidays. Today, it is a popular destination for many. Mentioned by Pausanias and Charles Texier, Ilıca thermal springs, which extend well into the sea, are also notable in Turkey for having been the subject of the first scientifically based analysis in Turkish language of a thermal spring, published in 1909 by Yusuf Cemal. By his time the thermal springs were well-known both internationally, scientific and journalistic literature having been published in French and in Greek, and across Ottoman lands, since the construction here of a still-standing yalı associated with Muhammad Ali of Egypt's son Tosun Pasha who had sought a cure in Ilıca before his premature death. Ilıca has a fine beach of its own, about 1.5 km long, as well as favorable wind conditions which make it a prized location for windsurfing. History. The urban center and the port of the region in antiquity was at Erythrae (present-day Ildırı), in another bay to the north-east of Çeşme. The town of Çeşme itself lived its golden age in the Middle Ages when a modus vivendi established in the 14th century between the Republic of Genoa, which held Chios (Scio), and the Beylik of Aydinids, which controlled the Anatolian mainland, was pursued under the Ottomans, and export and import products between western Europe and Asia were funneled via Çeşme and the ports of the island, only hours away and tributary to Ottomans but still autonomous after 1470. Chios became part of the Ottoman Empire in an easy campaign led by Piyale Pasha in 1566. In fact the Pasha simply laid anchor in Çeşme and summoned the notables of the island to notify them of the change of authority. After the Ottoman capture and through preference shown by the foreign merchants, the trade hub gradually shifted to İzmir, which until then was touched only tangentially by the caravan routes from the east, and the prominence of the present-day metropolis became more pronounced after the 17th century. In 1770, the Çeşme bay became the location of naval Battle of Chesma between Russian and Ottoman fleets during Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). Çeşme regained some its former lustre starting with the beginning of the 19th century, when its own products, notably grapes and mastic, found channels of export. The town population increased considerably until the early decades of the 20th century, immigration from the islands of the Aegean and the novel dimension of a seasonal resort center becoming important factors in the increase. The viniculture was for the most part replaced with the growing of watermelons in recent decades, which acquired another name of association with Çeşme aside from the thermal baths, surfing, fruits, vineyards, cheese, tourism and history. International relations. Twin towns — Sister cities. Çeşme is twinned with: 'PROPOSED SISTER CITIES' "

wikipedia-3984464," Fructan  A fructan is a polymer of fructose molecules. Fructans with a short chain length are known as fructooligosaccharides, whereas longer chain fructans are termed inulins. Fructans occur in foods such as agave, artichokes, asparagus, leeks, garlic, onions (including spring onions), yacon, jícama, and wheat. In animal fodder, fructans also appear in grass, with dietary implications for horses and other Equidae. Types. Fructans are built up of fructose residues, normally with a sucrose unit (i.e. a glucose-fructose disaccharide) at what would otherwise be the reducing terminus. The linkage position of the fructose residues determine the type of the fructan. Linkage normally occurs at one of the two primary hydroxyls (OH-1 or OH-6), and there are two basic types of simple fructan: Functions. Fructans are important storage polysaccharides in the stems of many species of grasses and confer a degree of freezing tolerance. A notable exception is rice, which is unable to synthesise fructans.

wikipedia-3984529," Puerto Natales  Puerto Natales is a city in Chilean Patagonia. It is the capital of both the commune of Natales and the province of Última Esperanza, one of the four provinces that make up the Magallanes and Antartica Chilena Region in the southernmost part of Chile. Puerto Natales is the only city in the province it is located lying northwest of Punta Arenas. It is the final passenger port of call for the Navimag ferry sailing from Puerto Montt into the Señoret Channel as well as the primary transit point for travellers to Torres del Paine National Park, Chile. It is located at the opening of Última Esperanza Sound and was originally inhabited by the Kawésqar or Alacaluf people and the Aoniken or Tehuelche people. The first European to discover the city was Juan Ladrillero, a sailor who was looking for the Strait of Magellan, in 1557. The city was later settled by European immigrants, primarily Germans, British, including English, Welsh and Scots, Croats, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards. It was then settled by Chilean people, with a substantial number coming from the island of Chiloé, all attracted by the sheep breeding industry. The city was formally founded under the government of Ramón Barros Luco on May 31, 1911. Nowadays, one of its most important industries is tourism although the cattle and aquaculture industries are also significant. History and current status. The province where Puerto Natales is located was named Última Esperanza (""Last Hope"") by the sailor Juan Ladrilleros, who was seeking the Strait of Magellan in the year 1557. It was his ""last hope"" to find the Strait after exploring the maze of channels between the waters of the Pacific and the mainland. It was not until three centuries later, in 1830, that another major expedition sailed through the fjords and channels of Última Esperanza: the British expedition of the sloop HMS ""Beagle"". Some of the expedition - (Robert FitzRoy, William Skyring and James Kirke) and their senior officers - are remembered by several place-names in the area. Commander Fitzroy was the captain during the Second voyage of HMS ""Beagle"" (1831–1836). In 1870, interest in the region of Ultima Esperanza was rekindled. Among the daring travelers who ventured to these desolate lands was Santiago Zamora, also known as 'Baqueano' Zamora. He discovered the lakes of the Torres del Paine area and many wild horses are locally known as ""baguales"". Another was the English traveler and writer Lady Florence Dixie, commemorated in the city's present-day ""Hotel Lady Florence Dixie"". Dixie wrote the book, ""Across Patagonia"". Puerto Natales was founded on May 1911 as a port for the sheep industry. During the last half of the 20th century the sheep industry declined and many people from Puerto Natales started to work in the coal mines of Río Turbio in Argentina. During the zenith of the sheep industry in Patagonia, two large ""frigorificos"" or freezer plants were constructed in the Natales area, of which one has survived. The plant at Puerto Bories, about 4 km NW from Puerto Natales, was a project of the Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego. The Puerto Bories site was inaugurated in 1913 and was in production until 1993. The Cold-Storage Plant was constructed in ""Post Victorian Industrial"" architectural style and features of number of British machinery examples which reflect the technology of the beginning of the 20th century. The Cold-Storage Plant complex is part of the industrial history of the Puerto Natales area. A restoration project was started on the complex in 2010. Tourism. Puerto Natales has many tourist facilities and it has become a common base for excursions to the world renowned Torres del Paine National Park, one of the most popular national parks in Chile. Its main feature, the mountainous “towers” (""torres""), are an impressive and unique rock formation known as ""Torres del Paine"". They comprise the Torre Central (Central Tower), 2,800 meters high; Torre Sur (South Tower) 2,850 m; and Torre Norte (North Tower) 2,248 m. Named a Unesco World Biosphere Reserve, the park is home to hundreds of different birds and many species of mammal, as well as the third largest ice field on the planet. The national park is open all year round but best season to visit the park is from October to April, the southern hemisphere spring and summer. This season has more sunny days with less rain and more than 16 hours of daylight. Twenty four kilometres (15 mi) northwest of Puerto Natales, along the flanks of the Cerro Benitez Mountains, lies the Cueva del Milodón Natural Monument. The area includes the Bernardo O'Higgins National Park; and the Alacalufes National Reserve. The latter is the site of the Fjord of the Mountains, Cordillera Riesco and Cordillera Sarmiento. A museum in nearby Punta Arenas. The Nao Victoria was one of the five ships (and the only one that survived) that sailed in the Spanish Armada de Molucca expedition which discovered the meeting point the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A realistic, technically and historically accurate replica of the ship commemorates the expedition and allows visitors to experience the historic voyage. Companies offering boat trips through the Patagonian fjords depart from Puerto Natales Pier and take tourists to view the region’s many icebergs. Bike trips around Torres del Paine National Park are a quiet way to admire the nature and the majestic sights. On horseback you can visit the characteristic farms that dot the countryside around Puerto Natales. Kayaks offer a quieter alternative to boat trips and are a perfect platform to admire the landscapes of the fjords from a different point of view. Today, there are dozens of camping sites, hostels, hotels, bed & breakfasts, restaurants and transportation services to fit a variety of budgets. There are daily Lan Chile flights from Santiago, Chile’s capital city, to nearby Punta Arenas in the Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region. The smaller Sky airline offers direct flights to Puerto Natales three times a week. Overland, Puerto Natales is 3,100 kilometres from Santiago, 2,300 kilometres from Puerto Montt and 1,600 kilometres from Coyhaique. Demographics. According to the 2002 census carried out by the Chilean National Statistics Institute, the Natales commune has a population of 19,116 inhabitants (10,068 men and 9,048 women). Of these, 16,978 (88.8%) lived in in the city’s urban area and 2,138 (11.2%) in rural areas. The population grew by 10.7% (1,841 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The commune comprises 96.3% of the provinces’s total population of 19,855. Its population density is only . Geography. Puerto Natales is situated along the shore of Última Esperanza Sound and has views northward into the Cerro Benitez peaks of the Cerro Toro formation within the Cordillera Manuel Señoret. The city of Puerto Natales exists within the larger Natales commune, one of eleven communes in the Magallanes Region. Since the entire province of Última Esperanza (56,554 square kilometers) is divided into only two communes, the result is a rather large but sparsely populated area for the Natales commune. The commune's area is , which renders it one of the largest communes in Chile, larger than seven regions of the country. Its altitude is . Administration. The city of Puerto Natales is the capital of the Natales commune and the Última Esperanza Province. As a commune, Natales is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Fernando Paredes Mansilla (UDI), and the councilors are: Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Puerto Natales is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Carolina Goic (PDC) and Miodrag Marinovic (Ind.) as part of the 60th electoral district, which includes the entire Magallanes and Antartica Chilena Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by Carlos Bianchi Chelech (Ind.) and Pedro Muñoz Aburto (PS) as part of the 19th senatorial constituency (Magallanes Region). "
wikipedia-3984544," 110 metres hurdles  The 110 metres hurdles is a hurdling track and field event for men. It is included in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympic Games. The female counterpart is the 100 metres hurdles. As part of a racing event, ten hurdles of 1.067 metres (3.5 ft or 42 inches) in height are evenly spaced along a straight course of 110 metres. They are positioned so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner. Fallen hurdles do not carry a fixed time penalty for the runners, but they have a significant pull-over weight which slows down the run. Like the 100 metres sprint, the 110 metres hurdles begins in the starting blocks. For the 110 metre hurdles, the first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13.72 metres (45 ft) from the starting line. The next nine hurdles are set at a distance of 9.14 metres (30 ft) from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 14.02 metres (46 ft) long. The Olympic Games have included the 110 metre hurdles in their program since 1896. The equivalent hurdles race for women was run over a course of 80 metres from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the 1972 Summer Olympics, the women's race was set at 100 metres. In the early 20th century, the race was often contested as 120 yard hurdles. The fastest 110 metre hurdlers run the distance in around 13 seconds. Aries Merritt of the United States holds the current world record of 12.80 seconds, set at the Memorial Van Damme meet on 7 September 2012 in Belgium. History. For the first hurdles races in England around 1830, wooden barriers were placed along a stretch of 100 yards (91.44 m). The first standards were attempted in 1864 in Oxford and Cambridge: The length of the course was set to 120 yards (109.7 m) and over its course, runners were required to clear ten 3 foot 6 inch (1.07 m) high hurdles. The height and spacing of the hurdles have been related to Imperial units ever since. After the length of the course was rounded up to 110 metres in France in 1888, the standards were pretty much complete (except for Germany where 1 metre high hurdles were used until 1907). The massively constructed hurdles of the early days were first replaced in 1895 with somewhat lighter T-shaped hurdles that runners were able to knock over. However, until 1935 runners were disqualified if they knocked down more than three hurdles, and records were only recognized if the runner had left all hurdles standing. In 1935 the T-shaped hurdles were replaced by L-shaped ones that easily fall forward if bumped into and therefore reduce the risk of injury. However those hurdles are weighted so it is disadvantageous to hit them. The current running style where the first hurdle is taken on the run with the upper body lowered instead of being jumped over and with three steps each between the hurdles was first used by the 1900 Olympic champion, Alvin Kraenzlein. The 110 metre hurdles have been an Olympic discipline since 1896. Women ran it occasionally in the 1920s but it never became generally accepted. From 1926 on, women have only run the 80 metre hurdles which was increased to 100 metres starting in 1961 on a trial basis and in 1969 in official competition. In 1900 and 1904, the Olympics also included a 200 metre hurdles race, and the IAAF recognized world records for the 200 metre hurdles until 1960. Don Styron held the world record in the event for over 50 years until Andy Turner broke the record in a specially arranged race at the Manchester City Games in 2010. Styron still holds the world record in the 220 yard low hurdles. Strides to Hurdle Success. The sprint hurdles are a very rhythmic race because both men and women take 3 steps (meaning 4 foot strikes) between each hurdle, no matter whether running 110/100 meters outdoors, or the shorter distances indoors (55 or 60 meters). In addition, the distance from the starting line to the first hurdle - while shorter for women - is constant for both sexes whether indoors or outdoors, so sprint hurdlers do not need to change their stride pattern between indoor and outdoor seasons. One difference between indoor and outdoors is the shorter finishing distance from the last (5th) hurdle indoors, compared to longer distance from the last (10th) hurdle outdoors to the finish line. Top male hurdlers traditionally took 8 strides from the starting blocks to the first hurdle (indoors and outdoors). The 8-step start persisted from (at least) the 1950s to the end of the 20th century and included such World- and Olympic champions as Harrison Dillard, Rod Milburn, Greg Foster, Renaldo Nehemiah, Roger Kingdom, Allen Johnson, Mark Crear, Mark McCoy, and Colin Jackson. However, beginning in the 2000s, some hurdle coaches embraced a transition to a faster 7-step start, teaching the men to lengthen their first few strides out of the starting blocks. Cuban hurdler Dayron Robles set his 2008 world record of 12.87 using a 7-step start. Chinese star Liu Xiang won the 2004 Olympics and broke the world record in 2006 utilizing an 8-step approach, but he switched to 7-steps by the 2011 outdoor season. After the 2010 outdoor season, American Jason Richardson trained to switch to a 7-step start and went on to win the 2011 World Championship. American Aries Merritt trained in Fall 2011 to switch from 8 to 7, and then had his greatest outdoor season in 2012 - running 8 races in under 13 seconds - capped by winning the London 2012 Olympics and then setting a world record of 12.80. Of the 10 men with the fastest 110m hurdle times in 2012, seven used 7-steps, including the top 4: Aries Merritt, Liu Xiang, Jason Richardson, and David Oliver. Hurdle technique experts believe the off-season training required to produce the power and speed necessary to reach the first hurdle in 7 steps, yields greater endurance over the last half of the race. That added endurance allows hurdlers to maintain their top speed to the finish, resulting in a faster time. All-time top 25 athletes. Updated June 2013 Most successful athletes.

wikipedia-3984646," Porter Airlines  Porter Airlines is a regional airline headquartered at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on the Toronto Islands in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Porter operates regularly scheduled flights between Toronto and locations in Canada and the United States using Canadian-built Bombardier Dash-8 Q 400 turboprop aircraft. Porter's operation at the Toronto airport was launched in 2006 after some controversy. Robert J. Deluce, who is now the CEO of Porter Airlines, came up with the idea of creating a regional airline using Bombardier turboprop aircraft to major cities of Canada within the range of Toronto. A planned bridge to the airport was cancelled in 2003, leading to lawsuits between Deluce and the City of Toronto. The airline lost the case in court but the idea for the airline remained. With the compensation received from the Toronto Port Authority for the lawsuit, REGCO bought the island airport terminal used by Air Canada Jazz. Air Canada was then kicked out of the terminal by REGCO. Porter has expanded its operations since 2006, adding more destinations and planes. Porter opened a new, larger, passenger terminal at the island airport in March 2010. Construction on a pedestrian tunnel linking the island airport to the mainland began in 2012 and is projected to be complete in spring 2014. Organization. Porter Airlines along with Porter FBO Limited, which operates the Porter facilities at Billy Bishop, and City Centre Terminal Corp., are owned by Porter Aviation Holdings (PAHL), formerly known as REGCO Holdings Inc. The company was founded in 1999. Porter Aviation Holdings Inc. is controlled by : Source: Bloomberg Business Week Source: Bloomberg Business Week At startup, $125 million CAD was put into the airline including money from: In 2009, Porter's institutional investors include EdgeStone Capital Partners, Borealis Infrastructure, GE Asset Management Incorporated and Dancap Private Equity Inc. In 2013, Porter's investors are listed as EdgeStone Capital Partners, OMERS Strategic Investments, GE Asset Management Incorporated and Dancap Private Equity Inc.. The then REGCO Holdings purchased the Toronto island airport assets of City Centre Aviation Ltd in 2005. This included the terminal used by Air Canada's ""Jazz"" airline, which at the time operated daily flights to Ottawa from the airport. On February 15, 2006, Air Canada had announced that its contract to operate its Jazz Airline service out of the REGCO terminal at the airport had been terminated. On February 27, 2006, REGCO was able to evict Air Canada Jazz from the publicly owned airport. Air Canada took the case to court, but lost an Ontario Superior Court ruling. REGCO's fully owned subsidiary 'City Centre Aviation' (now Porter FBO) then commenced renovations of the terminal building to serve Porter Airlines, which started flights in October 2006. Porter FBO operates the terminal along with fuel and other services. A new subsidiary, City Centre Terminal Corp., was set up in 2009 to manage Porter's new terminal at the Toronto island airport. The new terminal's cost of construction is estimated at $50 million CAD. The first half of the new terminal opened on March 7, 2010. The terminal was completed in early 2011. The new terminal has ten gates, two lounges, check-in and security areas, a duty free shop and food outlets. The airline's mascot is a stylised raccoon named ""Mr. Porter"". The raccoon appears in Porter newspaper ads. Porter also advertises on radio, using an announcer. The design of staff uniforms is based on 1960s standards of airline fashion. Porter has 933 employees as of March 31, 2010. Porter was initially organized as a private company. On April 16, 2010, Porter Aviation Holdings announced they were going to be listed as a publicly traded company. The company filed a preliminary prospectus — a business plan — with securities commissions across the country, a requirement before it can offer shares. The company has $306 million of debt and leases and intended to raise $120 million of new shares in the company and order seven new Q400 planes. However, after twice delaying the final deadline for the offering, and lowering its share price from between $6 and $7 per share to $5.50, Porter cancelled the initial public offering. According to Robert Deluce ""We came to the conclusion that it was really prudent to defer the offering at this time and to wait until better market conditions existed. We wanted to raise some capital. We thought the IPO was the way to go, but we weren't prepared in any way to sell our stock at just any price."" The media had openly speculated on the profitability of Porter as being a money-losing operation, as would be typical of a start-up. CEO Deluce had been asked by the media to provide information on the financial status of Porter, but declined. In its prospectus, the company outlined a loss of $4.6 million on revenues of $151 million for 2009. To be profitable, the airline needs to be filling 49.3% of its seats with paying customers. In 2009, the airline filled 41% of its seats, and in the first quarter of 2010, it filled 47%. Overall, the airline carried 900,000 passengers in 2009, 800,000 through Toronto island airport. In 2011, the airline filled 55.9% of its seats. As part of disclosure for its public offering, Porter disclosed that from its startup in 2006 until May 2010, Porter lost $44.5 million. In an interview with ""Toronto Life"" magazine in May 2013, Robert Deluce stated that Porter turned a profit in 2011 and 2012, and paid out profit sharing. History. Porter Airlines' launch was controversial. In 2002, the 'Toronto City Centre Airport', or 'Island Airport', operated by the Toronto Port Authority (TPA) was losing $1 million per year. Only Air Canada flew flights from the airport as part of its ""Jazz"" service, operating daily flights to Ottawa after the closure of the regional airline City Express in 1991. In October 2002, the TPA announced a $35 million plan of improvements to the airport to support expanding its usage. The TPA planned to build a $15 million bridge and a $20 million airport terminal. A new regional airline would be launched at the airport, to be run by Porter's CEO Deluce. Since its opening, the airport, located on Toronto Island, has been accessible by passenger ferry only and the ferry-only access was seen as an obstacle to expansion. In a deal with the City of Toronto, the TPA's plans were approved by Toronto City Council in November 2002. The TPA's plans were opposed by neighbouring residents and community associations who together formed the Community Air special interest group to fight the expansion. The expansion became a primary issue in the 2003 Toronto municipal election. Mayoral candidates Barbara Hall and John Tory supported the bridge and David Miller opposed it. Miller and a slate of like-minded candidates for council ran on a common platform, the centrepiece of which was to stop the bridge. After Miller was elected Mayor in November 2003, the new council voted to cancel the previous Council's decision, stopping the bridge project. After the bridge was cancelled, Robert Deluce launched a $505 million lawsuit against the City of Toronto and later expanded it to the Canadian federal government. After receiving an unspecified amount of compensation from the TPA to settle the suit, his company bought the airport building that Jazz was using at the airport and cancelled Jazz's lease on January 31, 2006. Two days later, on February 2, 2006, he announced that Porter Airlines, a regional airline operating locally built Bombardier turboprops would begin service in 2006, operating from the airport, initially on a Toronto-Ottawa route. In a show of political support, the Porter press conference was staged at the Bombardier plant in suburban Toronto, where the airplanes are built, with support from Canadian Auto Workers leader Buzz Hargrove, who said it would create new employment opportunities in the region. On the same day the TPA announced plans to improve ferry service to serve the new airline, buying a $4.5 million, 150-passenger ferry. Immediately, political opponents of the TPA, including Miller, City Council members, local community associations and local Members of Parliament Olivia Chow and Jack Layton expressed concern that the operation of a major airline from the island will cause increased noise and air pollution in the downtown core. Concerns raised include safety. The airport's main runway is long, shorter than Bombardier's specifications for a fully loaded Q400. Porter solved this problem by fitting the planes for 70 passengers, less than the maximum load of 78 passengers. There are several cautions to pilots flying into the airport, including boat masts, a nearby wind turbine, and no-fly areas. The flight path into the airport requires the airplanes to fly an approach offset from the runway centre-line to avoid nearby hazards such as tall chimneys and buildings. Jazz filed a $11.5 million law-suit against the TPA and later, Porter, in the Ontario Superior Court in February 2006, alleging that the TPA signed contracts forcing Jazz out of the airport, causing a monopoly at the airport, and were anti-competitive. Jazz later filed a suit in Federal Court. On October 20, 2009, Jazz formally dropped its suit in Ontario Court, but plans to continue its law-suit against Porter and the TPA in Federal Court. According to the announcement, Jazz dropped the matter in provincial court as the TPA is a federal agency, and the Airport is a federal facility. Damages in the federal case are not specified. Porter filed a counter-claim to Jazz' lawsuit citing damages of $850 million, based on Jazz agreement with Air Canada, and Porter has not dropped its counter-claim. The airline's maiden flight took place on October 23, 2006 to Ottawa. When flights began, airline passengers were at first blocked by protesters at the ferry dock, urging a boycott of the service. Although on-site protests eventually stopped, Community Air continues to monitor Porter's operations along with those of the TPA. The TPA confirmed at its annual meeting of September 12, 2008, that Porter was fined for breaking noise curfews in its operations following complaints from local residents. The TPA commissioned a study to reduce noise from Porter's takeoffs and landings. The TPA and Porter remain partners in the expansion of the airport. In January 2009, the TPA announced plans to purchase a new, larger passenger ferry to support Porter's expansion plans. The ferry is to be financed out of an improvement fee to be charged to passengers. The ferry had been proposed by Porter's Deluce to the TPA's Board of Directors over the period of March – June 2008. The decision to approve the $5 million ferry precipitated a conflict-of-interest investigation of TPA director Colin Watson, who is a self-described friend of Deluce's, and who voted in a 5–4 decision to approve the ferry. Watson was cleared of the charge by the federal ethics commissioner Mary Dawson in June 2009. In April 2009, Porter announced that it would build a $45 million terminal at the island airport, with Canadian Customs, restaurants, car rental kiosks, expanded lounge space and office space totalling . The terminal cost $50 million and its first phase opened on March 7, 2010. It will be completed in 2011 and Porter hopes to add a US Customs section. At the September 2009 annual meeting of the TPA, it was disclosed that Porter has broken its 11 p.m. curfew for landing at the airport three times in 2009, each time incurring a $5,000 fine. On one occasion, a Porter plane landed at the airport after-hours even after being advised by controllers to land at Pearson. According to Porter Airlines CEO Robert Deluce, ""You know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of flights come and go on a daily basis, so there are very, very few occasions where it happens. And there are also particular circumstances — and the circumstances are rare — to operate outside these normal times."" According to the TPA, they are powerless to stop Porter other than imposing fines, and that planes landing at the airport when no controllers are present is not a safety risk. TPA director Mark McQueen has requested that the NAV Canada personnel stay on-site until the last flight has landed, but NAV Canada has refused to do so. On January 10, 2013, 22 Porter ground crew members went on strike in Toronto. This is the airline's first labour dispute since it began business. In April 2013, Porter filed a libel lawsuit against the Canadian Office and Professional Employees union representing the 22 striking workers. Porter suit was for $4 million in damages for alleged defamatory statements made by the union using its Twitter account. The strike was settled in June 2013, and Porter's lawsuit was dropped. In April 2013, Porter announced expansion plans to serve new destinations in Western Canada, California and Florida. To support the expansion, Porter reached a provisional agreement to purchase 12 107-seat Bombardier CS100 jets, with a future option to purchase up to 18 more. Porter's plans require regulatory and facility changes to its Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport hub. Porter has asked for modifications to the operating agreement of the airport to allow jets and extensions to the runway to support the new aircraft. Changes to the operating agreement require the agreement of the TPA, the City of Toronto and the Government of Canada. TPA stated that it had no position on the expansion and would await a decision from Toronto City Council. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has indicated his support for the proposal while some councillors expressed their opposition, and some urged further study. Destinations. As of April 11, 2013 Porter Airlines destinations are: Porter Airlines lists proposed routes to American destinations from Toronto to Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. Other Canadian routes are also being considered. On September 17, 2012, Porter Airlines announced a new interline agreement with South African Airways in which passengers would fly from Toronto-Billy Bishop to Washington-Dulles on Porter, and then transfer to South African to either Dakar, Senegal or Johannesburg. Porter also has an interline agreement with Qatar Airways in which passengers can fly to Washington-Dulles on Porter and connect to Qatar Airways to Doha. In January 2013 Porter announced an interline agreement with Singapore Airlines with connections between Porter at Newark Liberty International Airport. In July 2013, Porter Airlines and Icelandair signed an interline agreement allowing customers to book a single e-ticket for Porter Airlines and Icelandair flights and booking baggage through to the final destination. Connections from 10 Canadian gateways between airlines are available in Halifax (seasonally), Boston, Washington-Dulles, and New York-Newark. This marks the first time Porter has signed an interline agreement providing access to Europe. Fleet. The Porter Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of April 11, 2013): Originally, Porter ordered ten 70-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprops, with ten more as options, at a value estimated by Porter of over $500 million. In June 2009, Porter exercised the option on the 19th and 20th Dash 8s. Porter chose the 70-seat configuration (less than the maximum of 78 seats) so as to land and take off safely within the length of the runway at Billy Bishop Airport; this also means Porter aircraft have a slightly greater seat pitch than a 78 seat aircraft. A fully loaded 78-seat configuration would need a longer runway than available at Billy Bishop. The 70-seat configuration also allows Porter to use the shorter runway 11/29 at Newark. In May 2010, Porter announced that it intended to order seven more Dash 8 Q400. On August 6, 2010, it was announced that Porter had ordered four more Q400s with options for six more. In November 2011, Porter Airlines accepted two new Bombardier Q400 NextGen aircraft, bringing the company’s fleet to 26. In April 2013, Porter Airlines announced a conditional purchase agreement for up to thirty Bombardier CS100 aircraft, including purchase rights for six more Q400 NextGen aircraft. Services. In Toronto, Porter provides a bus shuttle from the downtown Royal York Hotel to the ferry dock at the foot of Bathurst Street. The Blue Bird Corporation Ultra LF buses are operated by Pacific Western Transportation. The shuttle service had moved to the Royal York from its original location at 20 York Street, next to Union Station, in March 2008, when city construction for the Simcoe Street underpass blocked access. Porter planned to return to the location, but in September 2009, Porter was evicted from the 20 York Street building due to non-payment of rent. Porter provides complimentary snacks and beverages at their lounge at their Toronto Billy Bishop Airport. Porter provides complimentary snacks and beverages (soft drinks, Jackson Triggs wine and Steam Whistle beer). Porter Airlines offers a frequent flyer reward program called 'VIPorter', whereby points can be redeemed for free flights. "
wikipedia-3984673," Guanfacine  Guanfacine (brand name Tenex, and the extended release Intuniv) is a sympatholytic. It is a selective α2A receptor agonist. These receptors are concentrated heavily in the prefrontal cortex and the locus coeruleus, with the potential to improve attention resulting from interaction with receptors in the former. Guanfacine lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by activating the central nervous system α2A norepinephrine autoreceptors, which results in reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone. Its side-effects are dose dependent, with practically no dryness of the mouth at doses of 2 mg and less. Medical Uses. Hypertension. It reduces hypertension not just in short-term, but also as shown in long-term studies with normalization of blood pressure of 54% treated over a year and 66% over two years. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. An extended-release formulation of guanfacine (Intuniv) has also been approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in people ages 6–17. Its beneficial actions are likely due to its ability to strengthen prefrontal cortical regulation of attention and behavior. Guanfacine is also used in conjunction with stimulants to augment therapeutic actions, counter side effects, reduce rebound, and when taken at night, to induce sleep. Guanfacine is thought to improve regulation of behavior, attention, and emotion through actions at post-synaptic α2A adrenergic receptors on prefrontal cortical neurons, which strengthen prefrontal cortical network connections. In animal models, guanfacine is seen to affect a number of cognitive factors, including working memory improvement, distractibility reduction, response inhibition improvement, and enhanced attention and impulse control. Improvement is most evident in subjects with cognitive deficits; more subtle effects are seen in healthy young animals. Performance increases in spatial working memory have also been observed in humans. Another study found no effect on healthy male adults' executive functions and working memory, and small decrements on 2 tasks relating to the sedative effect of guanfacine. Recent studies suggest that guanfacine may help patients with a variety of prefrontal cortical disorders, including traumatic brain injury to the frontal lobe, strokes affecting higher cognitive function, and dysregulated emotional behavior, e.g. in children who have been traumatized. Anxiety. Another psychiatric use of guanfacine is for treatment of anxiety, such as generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Guanfacine and other α2A-agonists reduce sympathetic arousal, weaken the emotional responses of the amygdala, and strengthen prefrontal cortical regulation of emotion, action and thought. All of these actions likely contribute to the relief of the hyperarousal, re-experiencing of memory, and impulsivity associated with PTSD. Due to its prolonged half-life, it also has been seen to improve sleep interrupted by nightmares in PTSD patients. However, a recent study showed no benefit for patients suffering from PTSD.  Tics. According to recent studies (Srour ""et al."", 2008) there is controversy as to guanfacine’s usefulness in treating tics. There has been success when tic symptoms are co-morbid with ADHD, and as such, guanfacine and other α2A-adrenergic agonists (clonidine) are commonly the first choice for treatment. Withdrawal. Guanfacine is also being investigated for treatment of withdrawal for opioids, alcohol, and nicotine. Side effects. Usual: dizziness, drowsiness, headache, depression, constipation, gas pains, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and nasal congestion may occur. Rare: chest pain, shortness of breath, skin rash, swelling of the hands or feet, blurred vision, yellowing of the eyes or skin. Others: mental/mood changes, tingling of the hands or feet, dry mouth, impotence, decreased sexual desire, vision changes, taste changes, ringing in the ears, leg cramps. Cardiovascular side effects include orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia upon standing, and possibly bradycardia. Rebound hypertension is a possibility with abrupt discontinuation, and as such a gradual discontinuation is recommended. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Guanfacine has an oral bioavailability of 80%. There is no clear evidence of any first-pass metabolism. Elimination half-life is 17 hours with the major elimination route being renal. The principal metabolite is the 3-hydroxy-derivative, with evidence of moderate biotransformation, and the key intermediate being an epoxide. It is also shown that elimination in patients with impaired renal function does not differ significantly from those with normal renal function. As such, metabolism by liver is the assumption for those with impaired renal function, as supported by increased frequency of known side effects of orthostatic hypotension and sedation. In animal models, guanfacine’s enhancing effects on the working-memory functions of the pre-frontal cortex are thought to be due to inhibition of cAMP-mediated signaling, which is effected by the Gi proteins that are generally coupled to the post-synaptic alpha-2a-adrenoceptors that guanfacine stimulates through binding. "
wikipedia-3984800," Better Know a District  Better Know a District (also known as BKAD) is a recurring segment on ""The Colbert Report"". It offers a humorous explanation of a different United States Congressional district in each segment and generally includes an interview with that district's member of Congress. Structure. Each segment begins with basic information about a specific district, such as history and geography, and sometimes a humorously bizarre event that happened there. The district is also almost invariably referred to as ""fightin',"" as in the ""Fightin' 11th."" All segments feature an interview with its Representative. One comedic maneuver that Colbert commonly employs in these interviews, particularly when he is interviewing Democrats, is to ask the Representative a loaded question of either ""George W. Bush: great President, or ""the greatest"" President?"", or ""the Iraq War: great war, or ""the greatest"" war?"" When the interviewee tries to express his or her disapproval of Bush, Colbert will usually state that the only choice is between ""Great or Greatest,"" and nearly always states, ""I'm gonna put you down for 'Great'."" (He often refers to previous Democratic representatives who he put down as saying Bush was a 'great' president) After the interview, Colbert adds the segment to ""the big board"", a map of the entire United States with district lines drawn; the new district, shown in sparkling gold on a blue background, is usually very difficult or impossible to see due to its small size. Though many districts have been profiled, the map still looks largely vacant overall. Reactions of interviewees. Although the interviews intentionally show most of the Representatives in an unflattering light, the Representatives' post-interview reactions have varied. Colbert's interview with Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank resulted in Frank lambasting the program (he was quoted on a later ""Report""), while the interview with Virginia Representative Jim Moran pleased the Congressman — he told the ""New York Times"" that he thought Colbert ""let (him) off kind of light."" California Representative Brad Sherman appeared to be in on the joke. He claimed not to know that his San Fernando Valley district was home to the pornography industry, gave an apparently long and dull explanation of a tax proposal, and participated in the making of a ""pornographic video"" with Colbert and impersonated a robot. ""The Washington Times"" published a story on the show stating that ""several lawmakers said doing the spoof spot on 'The Colbert Report' on TV's Comedy Central actually has raised their profiles back home""; however, the ""Los Angeles Times"" has reported that due to the fact that many House members have ""stumbled badly"" during this segment, others are not risking ""the price for looking stupid"" and are passing up the opportunity to be on Colbert's ""Better Know A District"". On his November 7, 2006 show, Colbert lauded the fact that every one of the 28 actual congressmen whom he had interviewed by that point won election or reelection, which he claims to have been because they were given the ""Colbert Bump"". Because of the way Colbert intentionally tries to skewer congressmen in his interviews, former Democratic Caucus chairman Rahm Emanuel advised his fellow Democrats not to appear on the show, causing Colbert to make fun of Emanuel's advice on the show. However, Colbert now rarely features Better Know a District as a regular segment, suggesting many in Congress took Emanuel's advice. In January 2009, Colbert received what he claimed was a letter from U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and said he was cleared to begin interviewing congressmen once again. However he began the 2009 season of Better Know A District by interviewing Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz instead of a Democratic congressman. Following the 2010 congressional election on November 2, 2010, for the first time since the show began congressmen who appeared on the Colbert Report's the Better Know a District segment were not reelected in a general election. On November 3, 2010, Colbert ran a segment showing clips of those fallen friends called ""We Hardly Better Knew Ye"". District count. ""Better Know a District"" began as a ""435-part series,"" 435 being the number of United States Congressional districts; however, on November 29, 2005, Colbert banned California's 50th District after his ""friend"" Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham, the 50th's Representative, pled guilty to receiving over $2 million in bribes and resigned his seat. California's 50th is now the lone member of the ""Never Existed to Me"" category, and the map showing the United States' Congressional districts now looks as if the district does not even exist. This brought the series to a ""434-part series"". After this, Texas's 22nd congressional district was retired on April 4, 2006 when Tom DeLay announced that he planned to leave Congress. Texas's 22nd was reinstated on June 8, 2006, with a fake interview in which video of DeLay in three previous interviews on other television networks was interspersed with questions from Colbert. The congressman's words were used out of context for comedic effect. The district was put back into retirement at the end of the segment. In the show's first year, 34 districts were profiled. The original district map lacked Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. During a phone-in segment, a resident of Michigan’s 1st, which includes all of the Upper Peninsula as well as a sizable portion of the northern Lower Peninsula, reported this absence. Colbert informed the caller that he lived in Canada and if it was not on Colbert’s map, it was not a part of the United States. The Upper Peninsula was added to the map the next time it was shown. During the interview with Eleanor Holmes Norton, Colbert established that the District of Columbia was not a state, and thus the District of Columbia was not a part of the United States. The ""Better Know a District"" map was updated with an asterisk notation to reflect this fact. Furthermore, the count of 435 districts does not include non-voting districts, such as the District of Columbia; however, this segment was included in the district count, filling in for California's 50th district's absence, restoring the total to 435. After the 2006 midterm elections, Colbert was invited to a meeting of the incoming House freshmen at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. During this encounter, he brought his total of ""better-known districts"" from 36 up to 51 (including a British parliamentary constituency); however, he did not count these as installments, and the count picked up at 37 with the next regular installment. The show aired on December 12, 2006. List of districts ""Better Known"". The districts covered thus far in ""Better Know a District"" are shown below. Segment numbers are listed starting with the 37th installment as they no longer correspond to the actual number of districts profiled. ""The Washington Post"" has reprinted transcripts from segments of ""Better Know a District"". Spin-offs. Better Know a Challenger. In the months leading up to the 2006 congressional elections, Colbert interviewed the challengers in several House races. On several occasions he made clear that the challenger was interviewed because the incumbent declined to appear. However this was not always definitively the case. In these cases, the segment is known as ""Better Know a Challenger,"" with different intro graphics. After the segment, the district was colored on the ""Better Know a District"" map in goldenrod instead of amber, which is said to be the color all other districts are filled in with. It was upgraded to amber if the challenger won the 2006 election, or downgraded to cadmium yellow if they lost. Of course, it is nearly impossible to see the distinction between these shades on the map. Of the five challengers interviewed, only John Hall defeated an incumbent. In the instance of New Jersey's 3rd congressional district, Colbert frequently referred to challenger Rich Sexton as representative Jim Saxton, a joke on the similarity of their names. Better Know a Protectorate. On March 16, 2006, Colbert introduced a four-part series entitled ""Better Know a Protectorate"", focusing on the protectorates (more correctly, unincorporated territories) of the United States (which send non-voting delegates to Congress). The formula is relatively the same as with ""Better Know a District."" Distinctive elements include Colbert attacking the member for their (non-)voting record, and feigning cultural ignorance. For the first segment, the same ""Big Board"" as BKAD was used, but was discontinued with the airing of the second segment. The United States Virgin Islands (""the fightin' virgins"") was the protectorate that was covered and its delegate, Donna Christian-Christensen, was interviewed. On April 26, 2007, Guam (""the fightin' Guam"") was covered, including an interview with Madeleine Bordallo. A global map was used to produce the ""Big Board"", given Guam's distance from the continental United States. On August 7, 2007, American Samoa was featured (""the fightin' Samoa"") and an interview with Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin Faleomavaega, Jr. was shown. The remaining protectorate is presumably Puerto Rico which has yet to be featured (the Northern Mariana Islands did not have a non-voting member as of the start of the series, although they received a seat after the 2008 elections). Better Know a Founder. On March 1, 2006, Colbert introduced the ""56-part"" ""Better Know a Founder"", an in-depth look at the signers of the Declaration of Independence. For this series John Trumbull's painting of The Declaration of Independence is used as the template for the ""Big Board"". Using the same formula as Better Know a District, Colbert's first subject in the series was a spotlight of an interview with ""Battlin'"" Ben Franklin; the actor Ralph Archbold portrayed Franklin for the interview, with both he and Colbert wearing period clothing. Most of the hallmarks of the original segment remained, either in an altered form (e.g., King George: Great king, or the ""greatest"" king?) or unchanged (e.g., Colbert anachronistically asks Franklin if he had taken money from Jack Abramoff). On November 15, 2006, the second installment of BKAF featured three actors portraying President Thomas Jefferson in an America's Next Top Model style segment, ""America's Top Jefferson,"" with Project Runway mentor and producer Tim Gunn making an appearance. Better Know a President. On May 17, 2006, Colbert introduced ""Better Know a President"", a 43-part series that would refresh the viewer's memory of the accomplishments of every President in United States history. The first president covered was Theodore Roosevelt, played by Roosevelt impersonator Jim Foot. In keeping with the running gags of the segment, he asked Roosevelt if the Spanish American War was merely a great war of American imperialism, or the ""greatest"" war of American imperialism. The second covered was Thomas Jefferson. Colbert talked to three different Jefferson impersonators, and judged which was the best. Meet an Ally. On August 3, 2006 Stephen began the first segment in a series entitled ""Meet an Ally"" in which he examines nations part of the ""Coalition of the Willing"". He began the series by interviewing the ambassador of Palau, Stuart Beck. Betterer Know a District. When Colbert shows an extended segment of an interview at a later date, he calls the segment ""Betterer Know a District"". Better Know a Memory. On November 8, 2006, some representatives who were profiled in Better Know a District and had since been re-elected in the previous day's election were reintroduced in a short segment that immediately preceded the commercial breaks. A humorous clip from the BKAD interview would be shown and the words ""RETURNED TO CONGRESS"" would be rubber stamped onto the still image of the representative. The subjects reintroduced were Eliot L. Engel, Brad Sherman, Lynn Westmoreland, and Robert Wexler. Better Know a Governor. On January 21, 2008, after the Republican South Carolina Primary, Colbert interviewed Governor Mark Sanford as the easiest way to learn about all of South Carolinians. Better Know a Lobby. On February 6, 2008, Colbert began what he called an ""Infinite-long"" segment called ""Better Know a Lobbyist,"" where he interviews lobbyists. His first interview was with Joe Solmonese of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization. This was a two-part interview, with the second half being broadcast on February 7. On March 12, 2008, it changed to ""Better Know a Lobby"" and became a 35,000-part-long segment. The second interview was with Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, a lobby demanding the legalization of drugs. His third interview was with Paul Helmke of the Brady Campaign, an anti-gun lobby. Better Know a Beatle. On January 28, 2009, Colbert began what he called the first of a four-part series ""Better Know A Beatle"", where Colbert intends to interview all of the Beatles starting with his interview with Paul McCartney, bass player, singer-songwriter of the Beatles. Colbert introduced Paul McCartney as ""The Fightin' Walrus"", a reference to two Beatle songs, ""I Am the Walrus"", and ""Glass Onion"". Better Know a Cradle of Civilization. During his trip to Iraq, Colbert began his one part series, Better Know a Cradle of Civilization, during which he explained the history of Iraq. Better Know a Stephen. On December 16, 2009, Colbert began a new segment in which he interviews other prominent men named Stephen (specifically spelled with a ""ph""). He started off by interviewing Stephen King. Better Know a Riding. On February 22, 2010, Colbert began his one part series, Better Know a Riding, during his coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The featured riding (a riding is an electoral district in Canada) was Vancouver South, represented by Ujjal Dosanjh. Better Know a Kissinger. One part series on Henry Kissinger prior to Colbert's interview of Henry Kissinger. "

The legislation ""aims to increase the United States’ share of foreign direct investment and create American jobs,"" according to the Ripon Society. Playing Fair on Trade and Innovation Act. Terry introduced a bill designed to protect American manufacturers in foreign markets; notably ones that greatly benefit from American exports. The bill, dubbed the Playing Fair on Trade & Innovation Act, would prevent the executive branch from granting preferential access to U.S. markets under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) to markets that manufacture a product in their home country or infringe on copyrighted material. The GSP, which gives tariff-free access to over 5,000 products in over 127 countries, was designed as a goodwill venture for the United States but has been unfairly taken advantage of by some countries, according to ""The Ripon Advance"". Backers of the legislation believe this will close these loopholes legally and provide a great economic benefit to American business losing profit overseas. "

wikipedia-3985183," British rule in Burma  British rule in Burma lasted from 1824 to 1948, from the Anglo-Burmese wars through the creation of ""Burma"" as a Province of British India to the establishment of an independently administered colony, and finally independence. Various portions of Burmese territories, including Arakan, Tenasserim were annexed by the British after their victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War; Lower Burma was annexed in 1852 after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The annexed territories were designated the ""minor"" province (a Chief Commissionership), ""British Burma"", of British India in 1862. After the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885, Upper Burma was annexed, and the following year, the province of ""Burma"" in British India was created, becoming a ""major"" province (a Lieutenant-Governorship) in 1897. This arrangement lasted until 1937, when Burma began to be administered separately by the Burma Office under the Secretary of State for India and Burma. Burma achieved independence from British rule on 4 January 1948. Burma is sometimes referred to as ""the Scottish Colony"", due to the heavy role played by Scotsmen in colonising and running the country, one of the most notable being Sir James Scott, and the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company. Divisions of British Burma. The province of Burma, after 1885 was administered as follows: The ""Frontier Areas"", also known as the ""Excluded Areas"" or the ""Scheduled Areas"", compose the majority of states within Burma today. They were administered separately by the British with a Burma Frontier Service, and later united with Burma proper to form Myanmar's geographic composition today. The Frontier Areas were inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Chin, the Shan, the Kachin and the Karenni. Background. The First Anglo-Burmese War arose from friction between Arakan in western Burma and British-held Chittagong to the north. After Burma's defeat of the Kingdom of Arakan in 1784–1785, in 1823, Burmese forces again crossed the frontier and the British responded with a large seaborne expedition that took Rangoon without a fight in 1824. In Danuphyu, south of Ava, the Burmese general Maha Bandula was killed and his armies routed. The 1826 Treaty of Yandabo formally ended the First Anglo-Burmese War, the longest and the most expensive war in British India history. Fifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together with an unknown number of Burmese army and civilian casualties. The campaign cost the British five million pounds sterling to 13 million pounds sterling (roughly 18.5 billion to 48 billion in 2006 US dollars) that led to a severe economic crisis in British India in 1833. After 25 years of peace, the British and Burmese fighting started afresh, and lasted until the British occupied all of Lower Burma. King Mindon tried to readjust to the thrust of imperialism. He enacted administrative reforms and made Burma more receptive to foreign interests. But the British effected the Third Anglo-Burmese War, which lasted less than two weeks during November 1885. British troops entered Mandalay on 28 November 1885 and Burma was attached to the British Empire on 1 January 1886. Burmese armed resistance continued sporadically for several years, and the British commander had to coerce the High Court of Justice to continue to function. The British decided to annexe all of Upper Burma as a colony, and to make the whole country a province of the British India, within the Indian Empire. The new colony of Upper Burma was attached to the Burma Province on 26 February 1886. Rangoon, having been the capital of British Lower Burma, became the capital of the province. Burma before the British conquest. Because of its location, with trade routes between China and India passing straight through the country, Burma was kept wealthy through constant trade, although self-sufficient agriculture was still the basis of the economy. With the Indian merchants travelling along the coasts and along rivers (especially the Irawaddy River) through the country, where the majority of Burmese lived, Indian cultural influences filtered into the country and still exist there today. It was also one of the first Southeast Asian countries to receive Buddhism, which went on to become the officially patronised religion. Before the British conquest and colonisation, the ruling Konbaung Dynasty practised a tightly centralised form of government. The king was the chief executive, with the final say on all matters, but he could not make new laws and could only issue administrative edicts. The country had two codes of law, the Rajathat and Dammathat, and the Hluttaw, the center of government, was divided into three branches—fiscal, executive, and judicial. In theory the king was in charge of all of the Hluttaw but none of his orders got put into place until the Hluttaw approved them, thus checking his power. Further dividing the country, provinces were ruled by governors who were all appointed by the Hluttaw, and villages were ruled by hereditary headmen who were approved by the king. Arrival of the British in Burma. Conflict began between Myanmar and the British, when the Konbaung Dynasty decided to expand into Arakan in the state of Assam, close to the British colony of India. This close contact led to the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), which the British won with the help of the Siamese, and Myanmar had to give up Assam and other northern provinces. Then, in 1852, the Second Anglo-Burmese War was provoked by the British who wanted the teak forests in Lower Burma as well as a port between Calcutta and Singapore. The British were victorious in this war as well, but were still not satisfied, as they wanted access to the teak, oil and rubies of northern Myanmar. This prompted them to begin the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885. The British government justified their actions by claiming that the last independent king of Myanmar, Thibaw, was a tyrant and that he was conspiring to give France more influence in the country. Thus, in 1885, after three wars gaining them various parts of the country, the British finally occupied all of Myanmar, renamed it Burma, and made it a Province of British India. Early British rule. Britain made Burma a province of India in 1886, with its capital at Rangoon, and ushered in a new period of economic growth. Traditional Burmese society was drastically altered by the demise of the monarchy and the separation of religion and state. Though war officially ended after only a couple of weeks, resistance continued in northern Burma until 1890, with the British finally resorting to a systematic destruction of villages and appointment of new officials to finally halt all guerrilla activity. Intermarriage between Europeans and Burmese gave birth to an indigenous Eurasian community known as the Anglo-Burmese who would come to dominate the colonial society, hovering above the Burmese but below the British. The economic nature of society also changed dramatically. After the opening of the Suez Canal, the demand for Burmese rice grew and vast tracts of land were opened up for cultivation. However, in order to prepare the new land for cultivation, farmers were forced to borrow money from Indian moneylenders called chettiars at high interest rates and were often foreclosed on and evicted losing land and livestock. Most of the jobs also went to indentured Indian labourers, and whole villages became outlawed as they resorted to 'dacoity' (armed robbery). While the Burmese economy grew, all the power and wealth remained in the hands of several British firms and migrants from India. The civil service was largely staffed by Anglo-Burmese and Indians, and Burmese were excluded almost entirely from military service, which was staffed primarily with Indians, Anglo-Burmese, Karens and other Burmese minority groups. Though the country prospered, the Burmese people failed to reap the rewards. (See George Orwell's novel ""Burmese Days"" for a fictional account of the British in Burma.) After Britain took over Burma, they maintained the sending of tribute to China, putting themselves in a lower status than in their previous relations. It was agreed in the Burmah convention in 1886, that China would recognise Britain's occupation of Upper Burmah while Britain continued the Burmese payment of tribute every ten years to Beijing. Administration. The British controlled their new province through direct rule, making many changes to the previous governmental structure. The monarchy was abolished, King Thibaw sent into exile, and church and state separated. This was particularly harmful because the Buddhist monks were so dependent on the sponsorship of the monarchy. At the same time, the monarchy was given legitimacy by the Buddhist organisation, and the “church” gave the public the opportunity to understand national politics to a greater degree. Another way in which the British controlled their new colony directly was through their implementation of a secular education system. The colonial government of India, which was given control of the new colony, founded secular schools teaching in both English and Burmese, while also encouraging Christian missionaries to visit and found schools. In both of these types of schools, Buddhism and traditional Burmese culture were frowned upon in an attempt to rid the Burmese people of a cultural unity separate from the British. Finally, in order to control the country on the village level, the British implemented a “strategic hamlet” strategy in which they burned villages and uprooted families who had supplied villages with their headmen, sending them to lower Burma. Once these troublesome or unloyal Burmese were forced out, the British replaced them with strangers they approved of. If the British considered any Burmese to be criminals, they would act as both judge and jury, giving the Burmese no chance to a fair trial. Colonial economy. The traditional Burmese economy was one of redistribution with the prices of the most important commodities set by the state and supply and demand mostly unimportant. Trade itself was not as important as self-sufficient agriculture, but the country’s position on major trade routes from India to China, meant that it did gain a fair amount of money from foreign trade passing through. With the arrival of the British, the Burmese economy became tied to global market forces and was forced to become a part of the colonial export economy. The British immediately began exploiting the rich soil of the land around the Irawaddy delta and cleared away the dense mangrove forests. Rice, which was in high demand in Europe, especially after the building of the Suez Canal in 1869, was the main crop grown in and exported out of Myanmar. In order to increase the production of rice, many Burmese migrated from the northern heartland to the delta, shifting the population concentration, and changing the basis of wealth and power. In order to prepare land for cultivation, farmers had to borrow capital from Indian moneylenders at high interest rates as the British banks wouldn’t grant mortgages. Instead, the Indian moneylenders gave the mortgage loans out, but foreclosed them quickly as the rice prices and land costs soared. At the same time, thousands of Indian labourers migrated to Burma and, because of their willingness to work for less money, quickly displaced the Burmese farmers, who instead began to take part in crime, giving themselves a bad reputation. With this quickly growing economy, came industrialisation to a certain degree, with a railway being built throughout the valley of the Irawaddy, and hundreds of steamboats travelling along it. All of these mechanisms of transportation were owned by the British, however, and this meant that the Burmese had to pay higher rates to transport their goods to market. Thus, although the balance of trade was supposed to be in favour of Burma, the society was changed so fundamentally that many people did not gain from the rapidly growing economy. When the British began their imperial take over of Burma, the colony was immediately thrown into a world of exportation in which they had not ever been exposed to before colonisation by the British. This massive move towards foreign trade hurt the Burmese economy initially because suddenly a large amount of their resources were being exported for Britain’s benefit, thereby taking with it the resources needed by the Burmese natives to continue living their lives as they had before colonisation. An account by a British official describing the conditions of the Burmese people’s livelihoods in 1941 describes the Burmese hardships as they must quickly adapt to foreign trade: “Foreign landlordism and the operations of foreign moneylenders had led to an increasing exportation of a considerable proportion of the country’s resources and to the progressive impoverishment of the agriculturist and of the country as a whole…. The peasant had grown factually poorer and unemployment had increased….The collapse of the Burmese social system led to a decay of the social conscience which, in the circumstances of poverty and unemployment caused a great increase in crime.” Daily life under British rule. The British did not move in large numbers to the colony in Burma in the way they did to other colonies such as India. Instead, it was Indian workers who migrated to the country once it was under British rule, and competed with the local Burmese for jobs, lowering the standard of living in the country. The Burmese resented both the British and the Indian migrants, and staged guerilla warfare against the British army of occupation. The guerrillas were led by former army officers of the Royal Burmese Army as well as other former leaders (headmen, etc.). The guerillas fought hard against the foreigners, but were often captured and punished harshly. Their actions and the crime that began when the villagers were displaced by Indian workers, led to the British impression of their Burmese colony as a restless and violent place. Nationalist movement. By the turn of the century, a nationalist movement began to take shape in the form of Young Men's Buddhist Associations (YMBA), modelled after the YMCA, as religious associations were allowed by the colonial authorities. They were later superseded by the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) which was linked with ""Wunthanu athin"" or National Associations that sprang up in villages throughout Burma Proper. Between 1900 and 1911 the ""Irish Buddhist"" U Dhammaloka publicly challenged Christianity and imperial power, leading to two trials for sedition. A new generation of Burmese leaders arose in the early twentieth century from amongst the educated classes that were permitted to go to London to study law. They came away from this experience with the belief that the Burmese situation could be improved through reform. Progressive constitutional reform in the early 1920s led to a legislature with limited powers, a university and more autonomy for Burma within the administration of India. Efforts were also undertaken to increase the representation of Burmese in the civil service. Some people began to feel that the rate of change was not fast enough and the reforms not expansive enough. In 1920 the first university students' strike in history broke out in protest against the new University Act which the students believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. 'National Schools' sprang up across the country in protest against the colonial education system, and the strike came to be commemorated as 'National Day'. There were further strikes and anti-tax protests in the later 1920s led by the ""Wunthanu athin""s. Prominent among the political activists were Buddhist monks (""hpongyi""), such as U Ottama and U Seinda in the Arakan who subsequently led an armed rebellion against the British and later the nationalist government after independence, and U Wisara, the first martyr of the movement to die after a protracted hunger strike in prison. (One of the main thoroughfares in Yangon is named after U Wisara.) In December 1930, a local tax protest by Saya San in Tharrawaddy quickly grew into first a regional and then a national insurrection against the government. Lasting for two years, the ""Galon"" rebellion, named after the mythical bird Garuda – enemy of the Nagas i.e. the British – emblazoned on the pennants the rebels carried, required thousands of British troops to suppress along with promises of further political reform. The eventual trial of Saya San, who was executed, allowed several future national leaders, including Dr Ba Maw and U Saw, who participated in his defence, to rise to prominence. May 1930 saw the founding of the ""Dobama Asiayone"" (We Burmans Association) whose members called themselves ""Thakin"" (an ironic name as ""thakin"" means ""master"" in the Burmese language – rather like the Indian 'sahib' — proclaiming that they were the true masters of the country entitled to the term usurped by the colonial masters). The second university students strike in 1936 was triggered by the expulsion of Aung San and Ko Nu, leaders of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU), for refusing to reveal the name of the author who had written an article in their university magazine, making a scathing attack on one of the senior university officials. It spread to Mandalay leading to the formation of the All Burma Students Union (ABSU). Aung San and Nu subsequently joined the Thakin movement progressing from student to national politics. Burma separated from India. The British separated Burma Province from British India in 1937 and granted the colony a new constitution calling for a fully elected assembly, with many powers given to the Burmese, but this proved to be a divisive issue as some Burmese felt that this was a ploy to exclude them from any further Indian reforms whereas other Burmese saw any action that removed Burma from the control of India to be a positive step. Ba Maw served as the first prime minister of Burma, but he was forced out by U Saw in 1939, who served as prime minister from 1940 until he was arrested on 19 January 1942 by the British for communicating with the Japanese. A wave of strikes and protests that started from the oilfields of central Burma in 1938 became a general strike with far-reaching consequences. In Rangoon student protesters, after successfully picketing the Secretariat, the seat of the colonial government, were charged by the British mounted police wielding batons and killing a Rangoon University student called Aung Kyaw. In Mandalay, the police shot into a crowd of protesters led by Buddhist monks killing 17 people. The movement became known as ""Htaung thoun ya byei ayeidawbon"" (the '1300 Revolution' named after the Burmese calendar year), and 20 December, the day the first martyr Aung Kyaw fell, commemorated by students as 'Bo Aung Kyaw Day'. World War II and Japan. The Empire of Japan invaded Burma in 1942; this continued through 1943, when the State of Burma was proclaimed in Rangoon. Japan never succeeded in fully conquering all of the colony, however, and insurgent activity was pervasive, though not as much of an issue as it was in other former colonies. By 1945, British troops had regained control over most of the colony. From the Japanese surrender to Aung San's assassination. The surrender of the Japanese brought a military administration to Burma. British administration sought to try Aung San and other members of BIA for treason and collaboration with the Japanese. Lord Mountbatten realised that a trial was an impossibility considering Aung San's popular appeal. After the war ended, the British Governor, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith returned. The restored government established a political programme that focused on physical reconstruction of the country and delayed discussion of independence. The AFPFL opposed the government leading to political instability in the country. A rift had also developed in the AFPFL between the Communists and Aung San together with the Socialists over strategy, which led to Than Tun being forced to resign as general secretary in July 1946 and the expulsion of the CPB from the AFPFL the following October. Dorman-Smith was replaced by Sir Hubert Rance as the new governor, and almost immediately after his appointment the Rangoon Police went on strike. The strike, starting in September 1946, then spread from the police to government employees and came close to becoming a general strike. Rance calmed the situation by meeting with Aung San and convincing him to join the Governor's Executive Council along with other members of the AFPFL. The new executive council, which now had increased credibility in the country, began negotiations for Burmese independence, which were concluded successfully in London as the Aung San-Attlee Agreement on 27 January 1947. The agreement left parts of the communist and conservative branches of the AFPFL dissatisfied, however, sending the Red Flag Communists led by Thakin Soe underground and the conservatives into opposition. Aung San also succeeded in concluding an agreement with ethnic minorities for a unified Burma at the Panglong Conference on 12 February, celebrated since as 'Union Day'. Shortly after, rebellion broke out in the Arakan led by the veteran monk U Seinda, and it began to spread to other districts. The popularity of the AFPFL, now dominated by Aung San and the Socialists, was eventually confirmed when it won an overwhelming victory in the April 1947 constituent assembly elections. Then a momentous event stunned the nation on 19 July 1947. U Saw, a conservative pre-war Prime Minister of Burma, engineered the assassination of Aung San and several members of his cabinet including his eldest brother Ba Win, the father of today's National League for Democracy exile-government leader Dr Sein Win, while meeting in the Secretariat. 19 July has been commemorated since as Martyrs' Day. Thakin Nu, the Socialist leader, was now asked to form a new cabinet, and he presided over Burmese independence on 4 January 1948. Anti-British popular sentiment was so strong at the time that Burma opted not to join the Commonwealth of Nations, unlike India. "
wikipedia-4008963," Audrey Raines  Audrey Louise Raines is a fictional character played by actress Kim Raver on the television show ""24"". Characterization. Audrey (born Audrey Louise Heller) was born in either Albany, New York or Providence, Rhode Island (her file states Providence, however in Day 6, Jack Bauer states that she was born in Albany). Her mother died when she was nine. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from Yale University, and a Master of Arts in Public Policy from Brown University. She was employed as an Inter-Agency Liaison for the United States Department of Defense, where she was last assigned to the Los Angeles CTU division. Her skill set and expertise involved coordinating between government agencies. Audrey previously served at the Defense Department as a Senior Policy Analyst for her father Secretary of Defense James Heller. Raines had also worked as a consultant for government contracts for Anderson Aerospace Corporation and a government liaison for Ballard Technology, as well as a registered lobbyist. Her first job in government was a legislative assistant (possibly for her father) dealing with the House Armed Services Committee. Appearances. 24: Season 4. During the events of Day 4, Audrey wanted to make the divorce of her and Paul final. Jack planned to tell Heller about him and Audrey. However, when he learned that James Heller was targeted by a group of terrorists, under the control of Habib Marwan, both Heller and Audrey were kidnapped. For the next four hours, Jack was reinstated at CTU to find and rescue Heller and Audrey. Eventually, they were, but Heller was since made aware of Jack and Audrey's involvements. She later learned that Paul came to Los Angeles to see her, but was told by Jack that Paul may have ties with the terrorists. She witnessed Jack torture Paul, and was eventually torn between the two, since Paul attempted to win Audrey back. However, after Paul helped Jack, Paul was shot, and after learning that Paul needed support, she decided to remain at Paul's side. However, this plan went awry when Jack ordered all the CTU medical personnel, who was operating on Paul, to leave him and treat the grievously injured suspect Lee Jong instead. Paul died, which infuriated Audrey to the point of leaving Jack, despite still having feelings for him. She was devastated when she learnt Jack was killed, not knowing that his death was a ruse that would remain undiscovered for the next eighteen months. 24: Season 5. Eighteen months later, during season 5, Audrey is still working for the Defense Department. She was sent back to CTU as a DOD liaison to aid in their investigation into the assassination of former U.S. President David Palmer. When Audrey learns that Jack is still alive, it is evident that she still has feelings for him. A power struggle ensues between her and a new CTU chief, Lynn McGill, until the latter is forcibly relieved of command. Later on, she was implicated in the ongoing terrorist attacks by Collette Stenger, a terrorist collaborator, who said that Audrey supplied her with building schematics to sell to Vladimir Bierko. Karen suggested that they use torture. She was tied up and tortured for a while until the proper evidence was found that proved that she was innocent. Jack soon cleared her of wrongdoing - Christopher Henderson had ordered that Audrey's name be intentionally leaked to CTU in order to throw Jack Bauer off the trail — but not before being subjected to a medical interrogation involving Sodium Pentothal, the same drug used to torture Henderson and ""murder"" Tony Almeida. Bauer helped to clear Audrey of any suspicion. She was not immediately put back to work, in order to recover from the effects of the torturing chemical. Once Audrey was reinstated, Homeland Security agents Karen Hayes and Miles Papazian acted on their orders to absorb CTU. Because of her DOD ties, Audrey was unaffected. However, Miles attempted to force her to sign a confession blaming Bill Buchanan for CTU's failings. Audrey initially refused, but Jack told her of the White House's connection to Henderson, and that she and Chloe O'Brian were the only ones he could trust. In order to keep Chloe at her position, she agreed to sign the confession. Audrey then left CTU, but Homeland Security attempted to track her so that she could lead them to Jack, whom President Logan had now ordered to be arrested for David Palmer's murder. With Chloe's help, Audrey removed a tracking device from her car and escaped satellite detection. She called her father on his private jet and told him that it was urgent she speak to him personally. Jack contacted her shortly after recovering evidence implicating Logan, and she told him to meet Heller at Van Nuys Airport to hand off the evidence to him. After giving the tape to one of his guards, Secretary Heller had Jack and Audrey detained by his guards while he went off to confront Logan. Jack escaped and managed to recover the tape, but Henderson and his men arrived at the airport, taking Audrey hostage. In an effort to get Jack to hand over the recording, Henderson cut the brachial artery in Audrey's left arm, which would have led to her death in three minutes. Before she bled to death, Jack handed over the tape. After Henderson escaped, Jack put a tourniquet on her arm, saving her life. When Jack later apprehended Henderson (with Audrey at his side), Henderson said that he had his men on standby orders to kill James Heller if he did not contact them every fifteen minutes. Jack informs Heller about the situation, but Heller asks Jack to tell his daughter that he loves her, raising a red flag. When Jack asks over the phone with Chloe O'Brian to see if Heller had driven his car off the road from her satellite visual, it is confirmed that he did. Audrey went into a breakdown of grief, insisting that Jack should shoot Henderson if he would not give Jack the incriminating recording. It is later learned that Henderson had given the recording to another person. Jack claimed he had to stay and wait until Curtis Manning and his team could collect Henderson, but Audrey retorts that if the recording is not recovered, then her father would have died for nothing. Jack left Audrey alone with the recording, and Henderson's men eventually pinpoint their boss' location, pressuring Audrey to flee the scene. She attempted to assassinate Henderson before his men arrived, but her moral sense proved too strong. Audrey was rescued by Curtis Manning and his tactical team as soon as Henderson ordered his men to close in on her. Audrey later discovers at CTU from Curtis that her father survived going over the cliff, but remains in critical condition. Audrey remains at CTU to aid Jack while he attempts to stop Bierko from firing missiles from a Russian submarine. At the end of the day, with the crisis seemingly over, she reunites with Jack and the two share a passionate kiss. Jack is notified by a Federal agent that his daughter Kim is calling him. Jack leaves Audrey to take the call. Several minutes later, Audrey goes to check on Jack and is horrified to find him missing. She is unaware that he has been abducted by the Chinese officials who had somehow learned that he was still alive. 24: Season 6. When Jack asked about Audrey upon his return to Los Angeles, Bill Buchanan replied that she did not know he was back yet. Jack requested that he keep it that way. He later learns from Marilyn Bauer that Audrey had been killed in a car accident in China a few months before his release. Chloe O'Brian tells him it was Audrey who discovered that the Chinese government had kidnapped him and had been working through diplomatic back channels to secure Jack's release, although it was unclear at the time as to whether the Chinese government was involved in her death. Later in the day, after Jack secures the last two nuclear suitcases, Doyle gives Jack Bauer a call that he says is coming through a CTU switchboard, but is actually Audrey Raines. Jack is stunned to hear Audrey's voice on the phone, but she is cut off by Cheng Zhi, the Director of Security for the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Los Angeles. Cheng informs Jack that Audrey is still alive, but if he wishes to keep her alive Jack must call him back on a given number (the infamous 24 fan phone) when he is alone. Jack, not telling anyone that he had been contacted by the Chinese and Audrey, calls Cheng back and is told that a component from the nukes will have to be exchanged for the release of Audrey. Bauer agrees and requests help from Chloe O'Brian to get the plans for the chip. Morris O'Brian catches Chloe accessing his files, and persuades her to tell Buchanan. Buchanan has Jack arrested, but grants his wish to contact President Wayne Palmer. Palmer agrees to the rescue mission, guaranteed by Jack that he ""has his word."" Later in the episode, Palmer collapses from his previous head injury and Vice President Noah Daniels takes power. His first act is to shut down Bauer's mission. Jack realizes what is going on, and holds Mike Doyle at gunpoint, forcing him to exit the vehicle they were taking to Audrey's destination. When Jack forces Cheng to change the meeting's position to avoid capture, he is followed by Doyle, who steals a vehicle from a local civilian. After chasing him to an abandoned motel, he proceeds to start a gunfight after calling more agents and helicopters. Cheng narrowly escapes in a Hummer and has his men shoot down a helicopter, with the component still in his possession, and Audrey in CTU's safe keeping. When Jack is arrested for his actions, he turns to see Audrey be taken away by Doyle's fellow CTU agents and discovers, to his horror that Audrey has been severely traumatized by her time in captivity. Audrey mutters “Help me, Jack. Please don’t let them do this to me.” over and over to everyone, before entering into a catatonic state. Audrey and Jack are taken back to CTU separately, with Audrey sent to CTU's medlab. A medical specialist is called in to examine the catatonic Audrey, determining that Audrey had been systematically tortured and injected with mind damaging chemicals by the Chinese while imprisoned. To try to wake Audrey from her catatonic state, the psychologist brought in to diagnose and treat her condition prepares a potentially lethal treatment which involved injecting Audrey with more chemicals to ""shock"" Audrey awake. Meanwhile, Jack begged Doyle to let him speak with Audrey, feeling that he could reach Audrey due to the love they once shared. Doyle talks to the psychologist in the clinic about Jack's request, who refuses to allow Jack near Audrey. Nadia Yassir, the acting Director of CTU, backs the psychologist's decision, in part because of the psychologist pulling rank on her regarding having full control over Audrey. Doyle returned to holding and arranges for Jack to escape custody. Jack went to the clinic and stopped the doctor just as he was about to begin injecting Audrey. Taking Audrey to CTU's basement in a frantic attempt to escape, Jack then tried to get Audrey to wake up and remember where she had been held by the Chinese when she was returned to the states. Nadia, the doctor, Doyle, and two security personnel arrived, but just as they were about to take Jack into custody, Audrey uttered the word ""Bloomfield"". Bloomfield turned out to be the name of a copper company, and after CTU forensics found oxidized copper particles on Audrey's clothing, it is believed that this is where Cheng was holding her and that the location might be Cheng's base of operations. Jack and Audrey were taken back to holding and the clinic, respectively, right after Nadia promised Jack she would not let the doctor go near Audrey. Minutes later James Heller arrived, to take Audrey home with him so she can recover, and then warned Jack never to go near her again. Nadia Yassir later told Jack that Heller has moved Audrey to a civilian hospital, outside of CTU. During the season finale of season 6, Jack unexpectedly visits James Heller at home. Jack threatens to kill Heller if he is not allowed to see Audrey and escape with her. When Jack is granted access, he changes his mind about taking her with him; while watching her rest, Jack admits that they can no longer be together. He promises his eternal love, and then leaves the house and the season ends with a silent clock honoring Jack's sacrifice. "

wikipedia-4009240," Public nudity  Public nudity or nude in public (NIP) refers to nudity not in an entirely private context. It refers to a person appearing nude in a public place or to be seen from a public place. It also includes nudity in a semi-public place, where the general public is free to enter, such as a shopping mall. Nudity in the privacy of a person's home or private grounds or facilities is not public nudity, nor is nudity at privately owned facilities, such as fitness facilities, swimming pools, saunas, or gymnasia, nudist or naturist clubs or resorts, when nudity at those places commonly takes place. Naturism promotes social nudity. Not all people who engage in public nude events see themselves as nudists or naturists or belong to traditional naturist or nudist organizations. Several activists, such as Vincent Bethell, claim that association with naturism or nudism is unnecessary. Others will point out that many people who participate in events such as clothing-optional bike rides or visit clothing-optional beaches do so casually and without association or formal affiliation to groups or movements. Activist Daniel Johnson believes that labels and affiliations overly complicate a relatively simple phenomenon, alienate others from a fear of over-commitment or undesirable stereotypes, and thus get in the way of integrating nudity into everyday life. The social norms or laws of each culture require the wearing of clothes in most situations, but this expectation may be suspended in limited circumstances. For example, there are many countries which have designated public areas as nude beaches, or where nude bathing is unofficially tolerated. In those places, a person would not face legal prosecution or official harassment merely for being nude. Outside of those areas, community and legal acceptance of public nudity varies considerably. To avoid offending the public in general, public authorities maintain what are sometimes called ""standards of decency"". What falls outside these standards are usually termed ""indecent exposure"", or similar terminology. These standards, however, vary with time and place. If the intent is to draw attention to oneself, it may be referred to as exhibitionism, otherwise it may be to draw attention to a cause (see nudity and protest). There are also some people who disrobe in public to attract publicity to themselves, as a career move, such as some streakers at sporting events. There are also others who spontaneously disrobe in public, as an expression of their freedom and the shedding of inhibitions; an example being skinny dipping. Legal position. While it is often accepted in western countries that a naked human body is not in itself indecent, the circumstances of its exposure, and any offence caused to others, may be deemed offensive or disorderly. That principle is reflected in depiction of the human form in art of various forms. This is the position, for example, in Germany and Spain, although local laws in the latter country can stipulate that public nudity is either restricted or not permitted. In Barcelona public nudity used to be regarded as a recognised right, although there have been successful prosecutions for public nudity even there and a local ordinance by the local council in May 2011 empowers the authorities to impose a fine for nudity and even being bare chested. In the Netherlands public nudity is allowed on sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and ""other suitable places"" which effectively means any complaint will cause one to be arrested as a complaint is indication that the place was not ""suitable"". On the other hand, it is also recognised that there are large numbers of people who are, for various reasons, offended by and even distressed with displays of nudity. To accommodate these apparently conflicting principles, the courts will intervene only if there is evidence of intent either to cause offence or to behave indecently, or where such offence is a likely or foreseeable outcome. However, the exact standards of ""decency"" are subject to local community standards, which vary with time, place and circumstances. In general, public nudity with any perceived sexual element will be prosecuted, as it will if it is considered to be exhibitionist in character or involves exposure to children. In many countries public nudity is forbidden outright on the basis that nudity is inherently sexual. Many states of the United States fine offenders on that basis—see Indecent exposure in the United States. In many contexts, public nudity has been more accepted, especially at designated areas such as nude beaches and, even in the United States, e.g. during World Naked Bike Ride events or Bay to Breakers. In some states, such as Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech, as long as there is not the ""intent to arouse"". In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland nudity per se is not unlawful, but the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offences, according to a police spokesman in July 2013. Nudity and protest. Nudity has sometimes been used to attract media and public attention to a cause. Nudity in protest was used as a tactic by the Doukhobors in the early 20th century, and has been more widely used since the 1960s. Modern slogans include ""Disrobe for disarmament"", ""Nudes, not nukes!"", ""Naked For Peace"", and PETA's ""I'd rather go naked than wear fur!"". Public nude protest events include: Nude protests have a long history: Doukhobor, Women's Institute Calendar. Artistic expression. Though depictions of nudity have been an aspect of art at all times, contemporary art has extended the use of nudity to non-traditional forms. For example: Recreation and sport. Certain activities in public areas are more readily accepted to be done while naked, such as sun bathing and swimming. Everyday activities such as riding a train or bus, shopping, or attending school or work are almost never considered by the public to be appropriate without clothing. Examples include going nude swimming at hot springs, nude beaches, naked hiking, streaking and even roller skating. Sandy Snakenberg has organized nude skating and rollerblading events in San Francisco, the largest of their kind in the world. Nude beaches are found in many Western countries. In recent times, it appears that public nudity is becoming more common with nude sporting and other activities being held. These include naked hiking, canuding (nude canoeing), the World Naked Bike Ride, Bay to Breakers, Solstice Cyclists. Clothing-optional bike rides are becoming regular events around the world. Ritual nudity. Although most ceremony and traditions involve dressing up, often with some preferential attire, certain cultural or religious traditions actually prescribe(d) ritual nudity. For example, ancient Sparta held a yearly celebration from 668 BC called gymnopaedia during which naked youths displayed their athletic and martial skills through the medium of war dancing. The Adamites, an early Christian sect, practiced ""holy nudism"", engaging in common worship in the nude. During the Middle Ages, the doctrines of this obscure sect were revived: in the Netherlands by the Brethren of the Free Spirit and the Taborites in Bohemia, and, in a grosser form, by the Beghards in Germany. Everywhere, they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches. This may be symbolic, especially for 'rebirth' to a new life phase, as in the case of baptism (originally taken by an adult, later often as a child - to symbolise the washing away of original sin - and/or at least partially covered up) or certain coming of age rites, such as cow jumping by young men of the East African Hamar people before they are eligible for marriage.  In other cases, the physical exposure is a functional part testing endurance, e.g., to undergo scarification, as among various Australian Aboriginal and Sepik River tribes in New Guinea. In India, Digambara ascetic monks reject any form of clothing and live naked, or 'sky clad'. Digambara is one of the two main sects of Jainism. There is a tradition in some neopagan Wiccan covens of ritual nudity, called going skyclad. Sexual public nudity. Nudity in public, if any, is most commonly non-sexual in nature. For example, aspects of the Nambassa hippie festivals held in New Zealand in 1970s are regarded as non-sexual naturism. For example, of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3-day counterculture festival, an estimated 35% spontaneously chose to remove their clothing, preferring complete or partial nudity. However, some nudity in public may give rise to controversy. For example, some people regard flashing, streaking and mooning as indecent exposure and as sexual public nudity. Similarly, some people regard dogging, exhibitionism, and voyeurism as offensive behaviour. Burning Man camps range from non-sexual nudity to overtly sexually themed, while the Folsom Street Fair held in San Francisco is a leather and BDSM themed fair. "
wikipedia-4009259," American football positions  In American football, each team has eleven players on the field at one time. The specific role that a player takes on the field is called their position. Under the modern rules of American football, teams are allowed unlimited substitutions, that is teams may change any number of players after any play. This has resulted in the development of three ""platoons"" of players, the offense (the team with the ball, who is trying to score), the defense (the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them), and the special teams (who play in kicking situations). Within those platoons, various specific positions exist depending on what the player's main job is.  Offense. In American football, the offense is the side which is in possession of the ball. It is their job to advance the ball towards the opponent's end zone to score points. Broadly speaking, the eleven players of the offense are broken into two groups: the five offensive linemen, whose primary job is to block, and the six backs and receivers whose primary job is advance the ball by means of either running with the ball or passing it. The backs and receivers are also commonly known as skill position players or as eligible ball carriers (offensive linemen are not normally eligible to advance the ball during each play). The organization of the offense is strictly mandated by the rules; there must be at least seven players on the line of scrimmage and no more than four players (known collectively as ""backs"") behind it on every play. The only players eligible to handle the ball during a normal play are the backs and the two players on the end of the line. The remaining players (known as ""interior linemen"") are considered ""ineligible"", and may only block. Within these strictures, however, creative coaches have developed a wide array of offensive formations to take advantage of different player skills and game situations. The following positions are standard in nearly every game, though different teams will use different arrangements of them. Offensive line. The offensive line is primarily responsible for blocking. During normal play, offensive linemen do not handle the ball, unless the ball is fumbled by a ball carrier, or when a player who is normally an offensive lineman takes a different position on the field. The offensive line consists of: Backs and receivers. The six backs and receivers are those that line up outside or behind the offensive line. There are four main positions in this set of players: Depending on the style of offense the coaches have designed, the game situation, and the relative skill sets of the players, teams may run formations which contain any number of running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends, so long as the mandated ""four backs and seven on the line"" rule is followed. For many years, the standard set consisted of the quarterback, two running backs (a tailback/halfback and a fullback), two wide receivers (a flanker and a split end) and a tight end. Modern teams show a wide variety of formations, from a ""full house"" formation with three running backs, two tight ends, and no wide receivers, to ""spread"" formations featuring four or five wide receivers, sometimes without any running backs. Defense. The defensive team or defense is the team that begins a play from scrimmage not in possession of the ball. The object of the defensive team is to prevent the other team from scoring. The defense accomplishes this by forcing the offense to turn the ball over, either by preventing them from achieving a first down and forcing a punt, or by forcing the offense to fumble or throw an interception.  Unlike the offensive team, the rules do not restrict the defensive team into certain positions. A defensive player may line up anywhere on his side of the line of scrimmage and perform any legal action. Over time, however, defensive roles have become defined into three main sets of players, and several individual positions. Defensive line. Like their offensive counterparts, defensive linemen line up directly on the line of scrimmage, close to the ball. There are two positions usually considered part of the defensive line: Often, though not always, a defensive lineman will have his ""hand(s) on the ground,"" in a three- or four-point stance before the ball is snapped; this distinguishes his pre-snap stance from a linebacker, who begins in a two-point stance (i.e. without a hand touching the ground). Linebackers. Linebackers play behind the defensive line and perform various duties depending on the situation, including rushing the passer, covering receivers, and defending against the run. Defensive backs. Defensive backs, also known as the ""secondary"", play either behind the linebackers or set to the outside, near the sidelines. Defensive backs are primarily used to defend against pass plays, by covering wide receivers and tight ends to prevent them from catching the ball, or to attempt to intercept the pass from the quarterback. Defensive backs also act as the last line of defense on running plays, and need to be able to make open field tackles, especially when the ball carrier has gotten past the other defenders. A normal complement of defensive backs includes two cornerbacks and two safeties, though specialty defensive backs (nickelbacks and dimebacks) can be brought in in place of linebackers and defensive lineman, when there is need to cover additional pass receivers. Defensive formations are often known by a numerical code indicating the number of players at each position. The two most common formations are the 3–4 defense and the 4–3 defense, where the first number refers to the number of defensive linemen, and the second number refers to the number of linebackers (the number of defensive backs can be inferred, since there should be eleven players on the field.) Thus, 3–4 defense will consist of three defensive linemen (usually a nose tackle and two defensive ends), four linebackers, and four defensive backs (two cornerbacks, a strong safety, and a free safety). Special teams. Special teams are units that are on the field during kicking plays. While many players who appear on offensive or defensive squads also play similar roles on special teams (offensive linemen to block, or defensive players to tackle) there are some specialist roles which are unique to the kicking game.

wikipedia-4009290," Johnny Truant  Johnny Truant was a British, Brighton-based metalcore band, formed in 2000 under the name Severance. The band recorded 3 demos under this moniker before renaming themselves after one of the main characters of Mark Z. Danielewski's novel ""House of Leaves"". The band recorded their debut release ""The Repercussions of a Badly Planned Suicide"" (which featured three remixed songs from their second demo) in 2002 which was released on Undergroove Records. Their second album, ""In the Library of Horrific Events"" was produced by Killswitch Engage guitarist, Adam Dutkiewicz. The band have toured the UK, Europe and Canada with the likes of Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, Cancer Bats and Alexisonfire as well as playing Download Festival in 2005, 2006 and 2008. Although the band started out as a 4-piece, at the start of 2006, Al Kilcullen was added as a second guitarist. As of June 2006 however, Kilcullen was replaced by Reuben Gotto. The band signed to United By Fate Records in the UK and Distort Entertainment in Canada. Their third album titled No Tears For The Creatures was recorded in Brighton Electric throughout November 2007. It was produced and mixed by Dan Weller and Justin Hill of WellerHill productions. It was released on 2 June, however the album leaked onto the internet weeks beforehand. The band then signed to Ferret Music in the US and released No Tears For The Creatures on September 30, 2008. They were set to support Bring Me The Horizon in the US with Misery Signals and The Ghost Inside, however on October 31, 2008 the band unexpectedly announced on their Myspace that they were to split following their December UK tour. The band played their final show on December 17, 2008. "
wikipedia-4009296," Paul Nicholas  Paul Nicholas (born 3 December 1945) is an English actor and singer. He started out with a pop career, but soon changed to musical theatre. Later, in the 1970s, he began a screen career. He returned to the pop charts, starring in the 1983 BBC TV sitcom ""Just Good Friends"", for which he is best known. The show won a BAFTA and Nicholas was also nominated for best comedy performance. After the show ended, he returned to musical theatre and various other entertainment roles including producing and directing. Biography. Nicholas was born as Paul Oscar Beuselinck in Peterborough, England. His grandfather – who originated from Belgium — had been a chef in the merchant navy during World War II, before becoming Head Chef on The Union-Castle Line ships between England and South Africa. His maternal grandfather was a London docker. Nicholas' father Oscar Beuselinck, a former MI6 agent, became a highly esteemed entertainment solicitor, whose clients included MGM, Jack Hylton, John Osborne, The Rolling Stones, Tony Richardson, Richard Harris, Sean Connery, Yes, Robert Stigwood, and The Who. The family spent holidays at his maternal grandparents' home on the Isle of Sheppey, until Nicholas was 10. After his parents divorced when he was 12, his father's family home was at Letchmore Heath, Watford opposite the Bhaktivedanta Manor. Nicholas' paternal grandparents, Winnie and Oscar, lived in a small cottage on the grounds. Career. Nicholas began his pop career as early as 1960. Adopting the stage name Paul Dean, he formed Paul Dean & The Dreamers who were booked to support The Savages, the backing band for the British rocker, Screaming Lord Sutch. It was here that Sutch first noticed the young Nicholas, who was soon to become vocalist and pianist with The Savages. Still using the name Paul Dean, Nicholas released two solo singles in 1965–66. After taking a new stage name, Oscar, he began a long association with the Australian-born entrepreneur, Robert Stigwood. In 1966, Nicholas signed with Stigwood's Reaction Records label and his first single under his new name, ""Club of Lights"", scraped into the lower reaches of the Radio London Fab Forty chart. The second Oscar single was a version of a Pete Townshend song ""Join My Gang"", which The Who never recorded. His third single, a novelty song called ""Over the Wall We Go"" (1967) is notable for being written and produced by a young David Bowie and it gained a degree of notoriety because of Bowie's tongue-in-cheek lyrics concerning escaped prisoners and incompetent policemen, which satirised a rash of highly publicised prison break-outs in the UK and was banned by the BBC. After settling on the stage name Paul Nicholas, Nicholas eventually found success in the UK in musicals, beginning with the leading role of Claude in ""Hair"" (which Stigwood produced) before winning the title role in the original London production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". The part of Danny to Elaine Paige's Sandy made them the first British couple to play the leads in ""Grease"". He joined The Young Vic under Frank Dunlop and played Claudio in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and appeared in ""Crete and Sgt. Pepper"" by John Antrobus. He appeared as the Bully of the Boulevard in Richard O’Brien’s ""T-Zee"" at London's Royal Court Theatre. He also performed in Prospect Theatre Company's Carl Davies musical ""Pilgrim"". It was while touring with O'Brien in ""Hair"" in 1970 that he first heard songs from the yet to be produced ""Rocky Horror Show"" and made the first professional recording with O'Brien singing ""That Ain't No Crime"". On the b-side was a song entitled ""Very 50s"", where O'Brien introduces the characters Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott (In 2005 Nicholas sent O'Brien a CD copy of the recordings with a view to releasing them as an historical record). Thereafter Nicholas returned to the West End starring in Harold Fielding's revival of ""Charlie Girl"" with Cyd Charisse. Nicholas' film career began in 1970 in a French film with Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin called ""Cannabis"". ""Whatever Happened To Jack and Jill"" followed, in which he played Mona Washbourne's character's ungrateful grandson. He followed this as a psychotic killer in Richard Fleischer's ""See No Evil (1971 film)"". In 1975, he gained international attention when he played the cameo role of the title character's sadistic Cousin Kevin in Robert Stigwood and Ken Russell's film ""Tommy"". He worked again for Russell in ""Lisztomania"", playing Richard Wagner. In 1976, he embarked on a short-lived but high profile pop career, with three Top 20 hits in the UK Singles Chart ""Reggae Like It Used To Be"", ""Dancing with the Captain"", and ""Grandma's Party"", the last two of which reached the Top 10. He released the single ""Heaven on the 7th Floor"" in 1977. This only just reached the UK Top 40, but reached number No. 1 in New Zealand and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 listings in the US Paul received a gold record. He followed this with ""On The Strip"" which entered the Billboard Hot 100 No. 67 but failed to enter the UK chart. In the mid 1970s he hosted his own pop show on children's TV, titled ""Paul"". In 1978, he co-starred in the film ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" as Dougie Shears. Further films followed including ""Nutcracker"" with Joan Collins, ""Yesterday's Hero"" with Ian McShane and Susan Summers, ""The World Is Full of Married Men"" with Carol Baker, the romantic lead in ""Invitation to a Wedding"", and the loutish punk singer in ""The Jazz Singer"". Having done the workshop with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicholas returned to the West End stage in 1981 to create the role of the capricious cat Rum Tum Tugger in Webber's musical ""Cats"". He followed this originating the title role in ""Blondel"" by Sir Tim Rice and Stephen Oliver. That same year he starred in ""Two Up, Two Down"", a short-lived sitcom co-starring Su Pollard. Then in 1983, Nicholas got his first high-profile television role (he had acted in plays and one-off roles through the 1970s on TV) in which he was cast as Vince Pinner in the BBC TV sitcom ""Just Good Friends"", written by John Sullivan. The show, for which Nicholas also sang the theme tune, was a success. He was also nominated for a BAFTA. It ended in 1986 with the marriage of the two main characters in Paris. Nicholas went on to star in two highly successful series for ITV. In the major drama series ""Bust"" he was nominated Best Actor. He acted in two series of 'Close to Home', a sitcom about a vet. During this period Nicholas was seldom off television with many appearances including four ""Royal Variety Shows"". He also appeared in TV commercials for Rougemont Castle British wine, and magazine advertisements for Farah slacks. Nicholas returned to the theatre playing numerous roles on screen in both movie and television projects. He starred as The Pirate King in Joseph Papp's version of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" at the London Palladium and the Manchester Opera House, touring again in the same role in the late 1990s. Nicholas starred in ""Barnum"" in the first national tour and followed this with a highly successful season at The Dominion Theatre in the West End. At the end of 1991, while touring with ""Barnum"", Nicholas was the subject of ""This Is Your Life"". For his services to show business and charity, Nicholas was awarded a Silver Heart from the Variety Club of Great Britain and a Gold Badge Award from BASCA. Nicholas then starred in the national tour of ""Singin' in the Rain"", which was directed by Tommy Steele. In June 1996, Nicholas played the role of King Arthur in the Covent Garden Festival's production of ""Camelot"". He repeated his role of King Arthur in a BBC Radio 2 production of ""Camelot"". Other radio work included Gracie Field's husband Bert in BBC Radio 4's ""Gracie"". Nicholas then hosted two series of BBC Radio 2's ""Mad About Musical""', as well as his own hour long TV special, ""Paul and Friends"", for Thames Television. Nicholas fronted the Radio 4 children's series ""Cat's Whiskers"" during the 1980s. Nicholas was also the narrator of the children's animated series ""The Adventures of Spot"", part of the Spot the Dog franchise, in 1985. Although he was briefly replaced by Peter Hawkins for the first phase of ""It's Fun To Learn With Spot"", Nicholas reprises the role in time with the production of a second season of ""The Adventures of Spot"" in 1992, and also performed the narration for the second phase of ""It's Fun To Learn With Spot"". His involvement with the franchise ended in 1996, with his last credited appearance in the series being in the special ""Spot's Magical Christmas"". Such was Nicholas' association as the narrator of the franchise that he also narrated four stories featuring Spot the Dog that was released directly to cassette and CD in the late 1980s, and was also the voice featured on the Spot the Dog children's ride, which was first manufactured in 1995. In 1997, Nicholas starred as the anti-hero of Karoline Leach's ""The Mysterious Mr. Love"" at the Comedy Theatre in London's West End. Nicholas continued to appear as the lead in numerous straight roles thereafter: Simon Gray's ""Stagestruck"", a national tour of Michael Cooney's ""The Dark Side"" with Jenny Seagrove, ""Catch Me if You Can"" with Christopher Eccleston, and two plays by Eric Chappell: ""Mixed Feelings"", in which he played a transsexual, and ""Snakes and Ladders"" with Ian Ogilvy. Nicholas starred as John Smith in the original production of ""Caught in the Net"". He then co-produced, with Bill Kenwright, a new musical based on Charles Dickens' novel ""A Tale of Two Cities"", in which he starred as Sidney Carton. The musical then played Windsor with a Christmas season in Birmingham. In 2000, Nicholas appeared in the BBC television comedy drama ""Sunburn"", playing the role of David Janus, owner of the self-titled holiday company that the series centred around. He also played the role of Ronnie Buchan in the new police drama series ""Burnside"". Further television work followed with parts in ""The Bill"" and ""Holby City"". Nicholas then played the title role in the national tour of ""Doctor Dolittle"" and followed this with the role of Tevye in UK Productions' national tour of ""Fiddler on the Roof"". In the summer of 2006, he was a celebrity showjumper in the BBC's Sport Relief event ""Only Fools on Horses"", as well as appearing in ""Doctors"", ""Heartbeat"" and ""Holby City"". That autumn, Nicholas was attached to star in the British film ""Cash and Curry"", and also in that year he co-produced and starred in the musical ""Jekyll & Hyde"" in a UK national tour. In 2007, Nicholas and his business partner David Ian took part in a search for Danny and Sandy in the ITV1 show ""Grease is the Word"". Ian was a judge and Nicholas the acting coach to the contestants. He performed with his son Alex Beuselinck in ""Schwartz Stories"", a new musical at the Kings Head. Also in 2007, Nicholas produced and directed ""Keeler"", a new play based on Christine Keeler's autobiography ""The Truth at Last"". At the beginning of 2007, Nicholas starred as Julian Marsh in the UK tour of ""42nd Street"", directed by the author Mark Bramble. Nicholas left prematurely so that he could film the new daily ITV1 medical series ""The Royal Today"" in which he played the consultant surgeon Mr. Woods. In 2008, Nicholas played Alan Boon in BBC Four's ""Consuming Passions – a hundred years of Mills and Boon"". He also directed and produced ""A Tale of Two Cities"" at Upstairs at the Gatehouse. In 2009, Nicholas played Jack Point in ""The Yeomen of the Guard"" for the Carl Rosa Opera Company at the Tower of London Festival. He co-produced ""Jest End"", Garry Lake's take on the West End musical at the Jeremyn Street Theatre. In 2010, Nicholas returned to BBC Television with an appearance in ""Missing"". Nicholas undertook a UK tour playing the Pirate King in the Carl Rosa Opera Company production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"". In November 2010, Nicholas and Sean Maguire starred in a new play, ""The Haunting"". The ""Haunting"" continued in 2011 with Nicholas and Charlie Clements. In September 2011, Nicholas produced and directed a UK tour of ""Keeler"". The production starred Alice Coulthard as Christine Keeler. Nicholas also directed the musical ""Tale of Two Cities"" at the Charing Cross Theatre in April and May 2012, followed by the film, ""Gridiron"" in August. In December 2012, he performed as Captain Hook in ""Peter Pan"", a Christmas pantomime, at the White Rock Theatre in Hastings. ""Dear World"" by Jerry Herman will premier in London at the Charing Cross Theatre in 2013 starring Betty Buckley with Nicholas. The show will be directed by Gillian Lynne. Nicholas will coproduce a UK Tour of a new production of 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' as well as two shows at the Charing Cross Theatre the musical 'Wag' and the play 'Keeler' based on the Profumo Affair. Business. In 1990 whilst starring with David Ian in a production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" at the London Palladium, Nicholas offered Ian a partnership in co-producing and starring in a touring production of the New York Shakespeare Festival version of the popular Gilbert and Sullivan opera. Paul Nicholas & David Ian Associates Ltd were formed to produce the 20th anniversary production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" on a UK-wide tour, which sold out. They then produced a nightly fully staged version of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" in which Nicholas starred and again they sold out. The company has since produced numerous shows making both partners millionaires, including: School of acting. In 2006 Nicholas set up a franchise operation, the Paul Nicholas School of Acting & Performing Arts, aimed at teaching acting to school-age children. There are currently thirty franchises across England. In January 2008 Nicholas launched Paul Nicholas Community Arts, a project designed to engage disenfranchised children in the arts. The pilot scheme will be funded for fourteen weeks by Wyre Borough Council in the North West of England. A twelve week scheme began on 28 May 2008 in Blackpool. Personal life. Nicholas has been married twice, and has six children. His first wife, Susan, died in a car accident in 1977. Nicholas married his second wife, columnist Linzi Beuselinck, in 1984. "

wikipedia-4009431," Quasi-phase-matching  Quasi-phase-matching is a technique in nonlinear optics which allows a positive net flow of energy from the pump frequency to the signal and idler frequencies by creating a periodic structure in the nonlinear medium. Momentum is conserved, as is necessary for phase-matching, through an additional momentum contribution corresponding to the wavevector of the periodic structure. Consequently, in principle any three-wave mixing process that satisfies energy conservation can be phase-matched. For example, all the optical frequencies involved can be collinear, can have the same polarization, and travel through the medium in arbitrary directions. This allows one to use the largest nonlinear coefficient of the material in the nonlinear interaction. Quasi-phase-matching ensures that there is positive energy flow from the pump frequency to signal and idler frequencies even though all the frequencies involved are not phase locked with each other. Energy will always flow from pump to signal as long as the phase between the two optical waves is less than 180 degrees. Beyond 180 degrees, energy flows back from the signal to the pump frequencies. The coherence length is the length of the medium in which the phase of pump and the sum of idler and signal frequencies are 180 degrees from each other. At each coherence length the crystal axes are flipped which allows the energy to continue to positively flow from the pump to the signal and idler frequencies. The most commonly used technique for creating quasi-phase-matched crystals is periodic poling. Mathematical description. In nonlinear optics, the generation of other frequencies is the result of the nonlinear polarization response of the crystal due to fundamental pump frequency. When the crystal axis is flipped the polarization wave is shifted by 180 degrees thus ensuring that there is a positive energy flow to the signal and idler beam. In the case of Sum frequency generation polarization equation can be expressed by formula_1 Where formula_2 is the nonlinear susceptibility coefficient in which the sign of the coefficient is flipped when the crystal axis is flipped, and formula_3 represents the imaginary unit. formula_4 Development of signal amplitude. The following mathematical description assumes a constant pump amplitude. The signal wavelength can be expressed as a sum over the number of domains that exist in the crystal. In general the rate of change of the signal amplitude is formula_5 where formula_6 is the generated frequency amplitude and formula_7 is the pump frequency amplitude and formula_8 is the phase mismatch between the two optical waves. The formula_9 refers to the nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal. In the case of a periodically poled crystal the optic axis is flipped by 180 degrees in every other domain, which changes the sign of formula_9. For the formula_11 domain formula_9 can be expressed as formula_13 where formula_14 is the index of the poled domain. The total signal amplitude formula_6 can be expressed as a sum formula_16 which integrates to formula_17 and reduces to formula_18 The summation yields formula_19 Multiply above equation both sides by a factor of formula_20 formula_21 Adding both equation leads to the relation formula_22 Solving for formula_23 gives formula_24 which leads to  formula_25 The total intensity can be expressed by  formula_26 For the case of formula_27 the right part of the above equation is undefined so the limit needs to be taken when formula_28 by invoking L'Hôpital's rule. formula_29 Which leads to the signal intensity formula_30 In order to allow different domain widths, i.e. formula_31, for formula_32, the above equation becomes formula_33 With formula_34 the intensity becomes formula_35 This allows quasi-phase-matching to exist at different domain widths formula_36. From this equation it is apparent, however, that as the quasi-phase match order formula_37 increases, the efficiency decreases by formula_38. For example for 3rd order quasi-phase matching only a third of the crystal is effectively used for the generation of signal frequency, as a consequence the amplitude of the signal wavelength only third of the amount of amplitude for same length crystal for 1st order quasi-phase match. Calculation of domain width. The domain width is calculated through the use of Sellmeier equation and using wavevector relations. In the case of DFG this relationship holds true formula_39 where formula_40 are the pump, signal, and idler wavevectors and formula_41. By calculating formula_8 for the different frequencies the domain width can be calculated from the relationship formula_27. "

wikipedia-4009454," Pareo  The pāreu or pareo (see below) is the Cook Islands and Tahitian word for a wraparound skirt. Originally it was used only to refer to women's skirts, as men wore a loincloth, called a ""maro"". Nowadays the term is applied to any piece of cloth worn wrapped around the body, worn by males or females. It is related to the Malay sarong, Sāmoan lavalava, Tongan tupenu and other such garments of the Pacific Islands such as the islands of Hawaiʻi, Marquesas, Aotearoa, and Fiji. Etymology. In contemporary Tahitian the right word is ""pāreu"" (singular: te pāreu, plural: te mau pāreu), with the pronunciation of the word with a long ""a"" (hold the sound for two beats rather than just one) and the ""e"" and ""u"" pronounced separately, rather than slurred into a diphthong. It is not clear where the variant ""pareo"" comes from. It might be an old dialectic variant or an early explorers' misinterpretation. But both terms were already used in the 19th century (the Dutch geographic magazine ""De Aarde en haar Volken"" of 1887 had a few Southseas articles, some of them using pāreu, others pareo). Nowadays, however, ""pareo"" can be considered as the English-language form of the word (plural ""pareos""), much less likely subject to mispronunciation. Styles. The Tahitian pāreu are among the most colourful and bright of the Pacific. Originally flower patterns, the hibiscus flowers in particular, or traditional tapa patterns, were printed in bright colours on a cotton sheet of about 90 or 120 cm wide and 180 cm long. Nowadays they are also made in Tahiti itself and dye painting with varying colours is popular as well. A pāreu can be worn in many ways. Women will usually wrap it around their upper body, covering it from breasts to above the knees. Either they rely on their breasts for it not to slide down, or they may wrap a corner around their shoulder or their neck. In more traditional surroundings the covering of the upper body is less important, but the covering of the thighs is. Then it is worn as a longer skirt. Men wear it as a short skirt, or may even make shorts out of it, especially when fishing or working in the bush where freedom of movement of the legs is needed. But during quiet, cooler nights at home, they may wear it as a long skirt too. The ends of the pāreu are normally just tucked in, kept in place by friction only. No pins or other means are used. Only when as dress worn around the neck or shoulders, ends are knotted together. When it comes loose a few times per day, the wearer will just pull it tight again or rewrap him/herself. Nevertheless, when a lot of movement occurs, at heavy work or dancing for example, wearing a belt over it around the waist is common too. The ease of undoing it is not a burden, but rather a blessing. A woman (or man) may start her daily work on a colder morning wearing her pāreu as a long skirt and with a shirt. When it comes loose, the day may have warmed up enough for her to redo it as a shorter skirt. Again, some time later, she may discard her warm shirt and rewrap her pāreu as a dress. References.

wikipedia-4009518," Harold Demsetz  Harold Demsetz (born May 31, 1930) is a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Career. Demsetz (1988) includes a short intellectual autobiography.  Demsetz grew up on the west side of Chicago, the grandchild of immigrants from central and eastern Europe. He studied engineering, forestry, and philosophy at four universities before being awarded a B.A. (1953) in economics from the University of Illinois, and an MBA (1954) and a Ph.D. (1959) from Northwestern University. While a graduate student, he published an article each in ""Econometrica"" and the ""Journal of Political Economy"". Demsetz taught at the University of Michigan (1958–60), UCLA, 1960–63, and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago, 1963-71. In 1971, he returned permanently to UCLA's Economics Department, which he chaired 1978-80. He held the Arthur Andersen UCLA Alumni Chair in Business Economics, 1986-95. He has been affiliated with the Center for Naval Analyses and the Hoover Institution. Demsetz is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a director of the Mont Pelerin Society, and a past (1996) president of the Western Economics Association. Ideas. Demsetz belongs to the Chicago school of economic theory, and was one of the pioneers of the approach now called New Institutional Economics. He is a founder of the field of managerial economics. He has expanded the theory of property rights now prevalent in law and economics. Even though Demsetz never employed game theory, he is a major figure in industrial organization through his writings on the theory of the firm, antitrust policy, and business regulation. His expository style is devoid of mathematical formalism to an extent unusual for someone who began his career after 1950. His principal influences include Frank Knight and a number of colleagues: Armen Alchian, Ronald Coase, Aaron Director, and George Stigler. Demsetz was the first to propose emissions trading as a way of giving polluters an economic incentive to reduce their emissions of pollutants. He coined the term ""nirvana fallacy"" in 1969. The 1972 Demsetz and Armen Alchian article ""Production, Information Costs and Economic Organization"" was selected as one of the twenty most important articles published in the first century of the ""American Economic Review"".

wikipedia-4009559," Vought-Sikorsky VS-300  The Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 was a single-engine helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky. It had a single three-blade rotor originally powered by a 75 horsepower (56 kW) engine. The first ""free"" flight of the VS-300 was on 13 May 1940. While not the first successful single lifting rotor helicopter to fly, as the Yuriev/Cheremukhin TsAGI-1-EA machine was in the Soviet Union in 1931-32, the VS-300 was the first successful single lifting rotor helicopter in the United States and the first successful helicopter to use a single vertical tail rotor configuration for antitorque. With floats attached, it became the first practical amphibious helicopter. Design and development. Igor Sikorsky's quest for a practical helicopter began in 1938, when as the Engineering Manager of the Vought-Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft Corporation, he was able to convince the directors of United Aircraft that his years of study and research into rotary-wing flight problems would lead to a breakthrough. His first experimental machine, the VS-300 was test flown by Sikorsky on 14 September 1939 but had to be tethered by cables due to its inherent instability. In developing the concept of rotary-wing flight, Sikorsky was the first to introduce a single engine to power both the main and tail rotor systems. The only previous successful attempt at a single-lift rotor helicopter, the Yuriev-Cheremukhin TsAGI-1EA in 1931 in the Soviet Union, used a pair of uprated, Russian-built Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines of 120 hp each for its power. For later flights of his VS-300, Sikorsky also added a vertical aerofoil surface to the end of the tail to assist anti-torque but this was later removed when it proved to be ineffective. The cyclic control was found to be difficult to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tail boom. By varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. Roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. In this setup, it was found that the VS-300 couldn't fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around. Operational history. Sikorsky fitted utility floats (also called pontoons) to the VS-300 and performed a water landing and takeoff on 17 April 1941, making it the first practical amphibious helicopter. On 6 May 1941, the VS-300 beat the world endurance record held by the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, by staying aloft for 1 hour 32 minutes and 26.1 seconds. The final variant of the VS-300 was powered by a 150 hp Franklin engine. The VS-300 was one of the first helicopters capable of carrying cargo. The VS-300 was modified over a two-year period, including removal of the two vertical tail rotors, until 1941 when a new cyclic control system gave it much improved flight behavior. Survivor. In 1943, the VS-300 was retired to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. It has been on display there ever since, except for a trip back to the Sikorsky Aircraft plant for restoration in 1985.

wikipedia-4009568," Banana massacre  The Banana massacre () was a massacre of workers for the United Fruit Company that occurred on December 6, 1928 in the town of Ciénaga near Santa Marta, Colombia. An unknown number of workers died after the government decided to send the Colombian army to end a month-long strike organized by the workers' union in order to secure better working conditions. The government of the United States of America had threatened to invade with the U.S. Marine Corps if the Colombian government did not act to protect United Fruit’s interests. Gabriel García Márquez depicted a fictional version of the massacre in his novel ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"", as did Álvaro Cepeda Samudio in his ""La Casa Grande"". Strike. The workers of the banana plantations in Colombia went on strike in December 1928. They demanded written contracts, eight-hour work days, six-day work weeks and the elimination of food coupons. The strike turned into the largest labor movement ever witnessed in the country until then. Radical members of the Liberal Party, as well as members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, participated. Massacre. An army regiment from Bogotá was dispatched by the government to deal with the strikers, which it deemed to be subversive. Whether these troops were sent in at the behest of the United Fruit Company did not clearly emerge. The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets, and after a five-minute warning opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass, to wait for an anticipated address from the governor. Number dead. General Cortés Vargas, who commanded the troops during the massacre, took responsibility for 47 casualties. In reality, the exact number of casualties has never been confirmed. Herrera Soto, co-author of a comprehensive and detailed study of the 1928 strike, has put together various estimates given by contemporaries and historians, ranging from 47 to as high as 2,000 . Among the survivors was Luis Vicente Gámez, later a famous local figure, who survived by hiding under a bridge for three days. Every year after the massacre he delivered a memorial service over the radio. Another version by official Jose Gregorio Guerrero said that the number of dead was nine: eight civilians and one soldier. Guerrero added that Jorge Eliecer Gaitan had exaggerated the number of deaths. Justifications. General Cortés Vargas, who issued the order to shoot, argued later that he had issued the order because he had information that U.S. boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company. This position was strongly criticized in the Senate, especially by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, who argued that those same bullets should have been used to stop the foreign invader. Official U.S. telegrams. The Telegram from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 5, 1928, stated: The Telegram from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 6, 1928, stated: The Telegram from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 7, 1928, stated: The Telegram from the U.S. Department of State to Santa Marta Consulate, dated December 8, 1928, stated: The telegram from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 9, 1928, stated: The Dispatch from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 11, 1928, stated: The Dispatch from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 11, 1928, stated: The Dispatch from U.S. Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 29, 1928, stated: The Dispatch from U.S. Bogotá Embassy to the US Secretary of State, dated January 16, 1929, stated: Consequences. Guerrilla movements in Colombia such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) argued that the growth of Communism in Colombia was triggered by atrocities like these, and called it state terrorism. The Banana massacre was one of the principal causes of the Bogotazo, and the subsequent era of violence known as La Violencia. "
wikipedia-4009576," The Puffy Shirt  ""The Puffy Shirt"" is the second episode of the of the American NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld"". It was the 66th episode and originally aired on September 23, 1993. Larry David, the creator of the show, cites this episode as one of his favorites in the series. Plot. George is upset because he is moving back in with his parents. Jerry offers him money to pay his rent and Kramer tells him he can live with him for a while, but George declines. They help George move his things into his parents' house, but George is alarmed when they prepare to leave because he does not want to be left alone with his bickering parents. Jerry tells him that he is going to dinner later with Elaine, Kramer, and Kramer's new girlfriend Leslie (Wendel Meldrum), who is a ""low-talker"", someone who speaks so softly that she is often not understood. George wants to come, but his mother tells him he is going to dinner with her and his father. That night at dinner, Kramer tells Elaine and Jerry that Leslie is a clothing designer and has designed a new puffy shirt ""like the pirates used to wear."" When he leaves to go to the bathroom, Elaine explains to Leslie that Jerry is making an appearance on ""The Today Show"" to promote a benefit for Goodwill that helps clothe the poor and homeless. Leslie then says something. Not hearing what she said, Jerry and Elaine just pretend and nod their heads in agreement. The next day at Jerry's, Kramer tells Jerry that since he agreed to wear Leslie's puffy shirt on ""The Today Show"" she has been getting orders from boutiques and department stores to produce more of them. Jerry does not know what he is talking about and Kramer explains that Jerry had told Leslie yes when she asked if he would wear the shirt on ""The Today Show"" at the restaurant. Jerry protests wearing the shirt because he could not hear a word she was saying, but Kramer tells him he has to wear it because factories are already producing them and stores are beginning to stock them. Later, Jerry and Kramer are backstage in a dressing room at ""The Today Show"" studio. The stagehand tells Jerry he has five minutes until he goes on the air. Elaine arrives and immediately laughs at Jerry's shirt and tells him he looks like The Count of Monte Cristo. Jerry makes his appearance on ""The Today Show"", but Bryant Gumbel cannot help but laugh and talk about his puffy shirt. Jerry is pushed over the edge and denounces the shirt on the air, causing Leslie to shout ""You bastard!"" off camera. Jerry says ""Now ""that"" I heard."" George heads to meet Jerry at the NBC studios. In the dressing room, Leslie screams at Jerry for ruining her career. George bursts in and tells Jerry of his good fortune (regarding a subplot about his potential career as a hand model). Elaine, who has never noticed George's hands before, asks to see them. George takes off his mittens, then proceeds to mock and laugh at Jerry's shirt, unaware that Leslie, who is still in the room, can hear him. Furious, she pushes George and he trips, burning his now exposed hands on a hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. The episode ends with the four sitting at a coffee shop. George's hands are bandaged up and Elaine helps feed him. He mockingly tells them that his hand model career is over ""because of the puffy shirt."" The shirt fiasco also caused Elaine to get fired from the benefit committee at Goodwill. Jerry says that he gets constantly heckled during his stand-up performances because of the shirt (""Avast ye maties"" is one heckler's comment). Kramer tells them that all the stores canceled out on Leslie and that he broke up with her because he ""can't be with someone whose life is in complete disarray."" The remaining shirts were given to Goodwill and when the four friends leave, two homeless men outside, dressed in the puffy shirts, ask for change. When giving them some money, Jerry remarks that it's not really a bad-looking shirt after all. "
wikipedia-4009595," International Trade Mart  The International Trade Mart is an organization promoting international trade and the Port of New Orleans.  The World Trade Mart was chartered in 1945, first opened its doors in 1948, and in 1985, merged with International House to form the World Trade Center New Orleans, a private, non-profit organization with a membership of 2,000 corporations and individuals dedicated to improving trade with New Orleans, Louisiana.  Like its predecessor organizations, the WTC continues to sponsor trade missions to Latin American and Caribbean nations to conduct a variety of educational programs, conferences, seminars, and trade shows and to host dignitaries and other visitors from New Orleans' trade partner nations. The WTC's work is conducted from its 33-story headquarters at the foot of Canal Street.  Trade expansionists advanced their cause further by forming the International Trade Mart (ITM). They intended that IH House and ITM would complement each other and together would form the international program's foundation. The mart satisfied a longstanding ambition for an institution that could exhibit commodities and could provide a setting where buyer and seller could meet easily in New Orleans.  Since the city lacked a manufacturing base, buyers from, say, Mexico might--absent a mart in New Orleans--travel to, say, Toledo to purchase steel or glass. The resulting trade might well bypass New Orleans. But the mart, thought trade expansionists, would maximize the port's chances of handling this trade.  New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, notable for being tried for conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, is claimed to be the driving force behind the founding of the International Trade Mart. "

wikipedia-4009786," Alphanumeric  Alphanumeric (sometimes shortened to alphameric) is a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters, and is used to describe the collection of Latin letters and Arabic digits or a text constructed from this collection. In the POSIX/C locale, there are either 36 (A-Z0-9, case insensitive) or 62 (A-Za-z0-9, case-sensitive) alphanumeric characters. In other locales, the term ""alphanumeric"" applies to a broader character set. Subsets of alphanumeric used in human interfaces. When a string of mixed alphabets and numerals is presented for human interpretation, ambiguities arise. The most obvious is the similarity of the letters I, O and Q to the numbers 1 and 0. Therefore, depending on the application, various subsets of the alphanumeric were adopted to avoid misinterpretation by humans. In passenger aircraft, aircraft seat maps and seats were designated by row number followed by column letter. For wide bodied jets, the seats can be 10 across, labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK. The letter I is skipped to avoid mistaking it as row number 1. In Vehicle Identification Number used by motor vehicle manufacturers, the letters I, O and Q are omitted for their similarity to 1 or 0. Tiny embossed letters are used to label pins on an V.35/M34 electrical connector. The letters I, O, Q, S and Z were dropped to ease eye strain with 1, 0, 5, and 2. That subset is named the DEC Alphabet after the company that first used it. For alphanumerics that are frequently handwritten, in addition to I and O, V is avoided because it looks like U in cursive, and Z for its similarity to 2. "

It is the most visited museum in Mexico. Located in the area between Paseo de la Reforma and Calle Mahatma Gandhi within Chapultepec Park in Mexico City, the museum contains significant archaeological and anthropological artifacts from the pre-Columbian heritage of Mexico, such as the ""Piedra del Sol"" (the ""Stone of the Sun"" or Aztec calendar stone) and the 16th-century Aztec statue of Xochipilli. Architecture. Designed in 1963 by Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, Jorge Campuzano and Rafael Mijares, it has an impressive architecture with exhibition halls surrounding a patio with a huge pond and a vast square concrete umbrella supported by a single slender pillar (known as ""el paraguas"", Spanish for ""the umbrella"") around which splashes an artificial cascade. The halls are ringed by gardens, many of which contain outdoor exhibits. The museum has 23 rooms for exhibits and covers an area of 79,700 square meters (almost 8 hectares) or 857,890 square feet (almost 20 acres). Exhibits. Opened in 1964 by President Adolfo López Mateos, the museum has a number of significant exhibits, such as the Stone of the Sun (depicted below), giant stone heads of the Olmec civilization that were found in the jungles of Tabasco and Veracruz, treasures recovered from the Maya civilization, at the ""Sacred Cenote"" at Chichen Itza, a replica of the sarcophagal lid from Pacal's tomb at Palenque and ethnological displays of contemporary rural Mexican life. It also has a model of the location and layout of the former Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, the site of which is now occupied by the central area of modern-day Mexico City itself. The museum also hosts visiting exhibits, generally focusing on other of the world's great cultures. Past exhibits have focused on ancient Iran, Greece, China, Egypt, Russia, and Spain. Name. There is another institution, the National Museum of History which is located in the nearby Chapultepec Castle, but it is a different museum altogether. The former focuses on pre-Columbian Mexico and modern day Mexican ethnography. The latter focuses on the Viceroyalty of New Spain and its progress towards modern Mexico, up to the 20th Century. However, the official administrative body that manages both museums (and many other national and regional museums) is the National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia).

wikipedia-4009961," Loprazolam  Loprazolam (Triazulenone) marketed under the brand names Dormonoct, Havlane, Sonin, Somnovit, is a drug which is an imidazole benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is available in 1 mg and 2 mg tablets. It is licensed and marketed for the short term treatment of moderately severe insomnia. Indications. Insomnia. Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Loprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or have difficulty falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis. Dose. The dose of Loprazolam for insomnia is usually 1 mg but can be increased to 2 mg if necessary. In the elderly a lower dose is recommended due to more pronounced effects and a significant impairment of standing up to 11 hours after dosing of 1 mg of loprazolam. The half-life is much more prolonged in the elderly than in younger patients. A half-life of 19.8 hours has been reported in elderly patients. Patients and prescribing physicians should however bear in mind that higher doses of loprazolam may impair long term memory functions. Side effects. Side effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as diazepam. The only main difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half-life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half-life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following: List of Side Effects Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of loprazolam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day which may increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal. Loprazolam, like all other benzodiazepines, is recommended only for the short term management of insomnia in the UK, owing to the risk of serious adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition. Benzodiazepines can become less effective over time and patients can develop increasing physical and psychological adverse effects, e.g., agorophobia, gastrointestinal complaints, and peripheral nerve abnormalities such as burning and tingling sensations.  Loprazolam has a low risk of physical dependence and withdrawal if it is used for less than 4 weeks or very occasionally. However, one placebo controlled study comparing 3 weeks of treatment for insomnia with either loprazolam or triazolam showed rebound anxiety and insomnia occurring 3 days after discontinuing loprazolam therapy, whereas with triazolam the rebound anxiety and insomnia was seen the next day. The differences between the two are likely due to the differing elimination half-lives of the two drugs. These results would suggest that loprazolam and possibly other benzodiazepines should be prescribed for 1 – 2 weeks rather than 2 – 4 weeks to reduce the risk of physical dependence, withdrawal, and rebound phenomenon. Withdrawal symptoms Slow reduction of the dosage over a period of months at a rate that the individual can tolerate greatly minimizes the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. Individuals who are benzodiazepine dependent often cross to an equivalent dose of diazepam to taper gradually, as diazepam has a longer half-life and small dose reductions can be achieved more easily. Major complications can occur after abrupt or rapid withdrawal, especially from high doses, producing symptoms such as: It has been estimated that between 30% and 50% of long term users of benzodiazepines will experience withdrawal symptoms. However, up to 90% of patients withdrawing from benzodiazepines experienced withdrawal symptoms in one study, but the rate of taper was very fast at 25% of dose per week. Withdrawal symptoms tend to last between 3 weeks to 3 months, although 10 - 15% of people may experience a protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome with symptoms persisting and gradually declining over a period of many months and occasionally several years. Contraindications and special caution. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Loprazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Mechanism of action. Loprazolam is a benzodiazepine, which acts via positively modulating the GABAA receptor complex via a binding to the benzodiazepine receptor which is situated on alpha subunit containing GABAA receptors. This action enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptor complex by increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel. This action allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron which in turn produces the following properties: muscle relaxation, anxiolytic, hypnotic, amnesic and anticonvulsant. These properties can be used for therapeutic benefit in clinical practise. These properties are also sometimes used for recreational purposes in the form of drug abuse of benzodiazepines where high doses are used to achieve intoxication and or sedation. Pharmacokinetics. After oral administration of loprazolam on an empty stomach, it takes 2 hours for serum concentration levels to peak, significantly longer than other benzodiazepine hypnotics. This delay brings into question the benefit of loprazolam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics, although some studies show that loprazolam may induce sleep within half an hour, indicating rapid penetration into the brain. The peak plasma delay of loprazolam, therefore, may not be relevant to loprazolam's efficacy as a hypnotic. If taken after a meal it can take even longer for loprazolam plasma levels to peak. Loprazolam significantly alters electrical activity in the brain as measured by EEG, with these changes become more pronounced as the dose increases. Roughly half of each dose is metabolized in humans to produce an active metabolite with similar potency to loprazolam, the other half is excreted unchanged. The half-life of the active metabolite is about the same as the parent compound loprazolam. "
wikipedia-4009982," Adrian Sutil  Adrian Sutil (; born 11 January 1983 in Starnberg, West Germany) is a German racing driver and drives for Force India in Formula One. Sutil started karting at the age of 14 and moved into single seater racing in 2002 in the Swiss Formula Ford series where he won the title. He moved up into Formula Masters Austria and started 1 race before stepping into Formula BMW ADAC in 2003. Sutil then raced in the Formula 3 Euroseries where he was the runner-up to Lewis Hamilton in 2005. He went to Japan in 2006 to race in the All-Japan Formula Three Championship and also finished 3rd in the Macau Grand Prix. Having been involved in the Midland F1 test team, Sutil was promoted to a race seat for the new Spyker F1 team in 2007. Sutil continued to race with the team under their new guise Force India in 2008 where he remained until 2011. He made his return to the sport in 2013 again with Force India. Biography. Sutil is the son of professional musicians Monika, a German, and Jorge, a Uruguayan. He has two brothers, named Daniel and Raphael. He weighs 165 pounds (75 kilograms) and is 6 feet (183 centimeters) tall. A talented pianist, Sutil started karting at 14 before moving up to Swiss Formula Ford 1800 in 2002. He won all ten rounds of the season from pole and added five wins in the Formula Masters Austria championship. Sutil speaks fluent German, English, and Spanish and a little Italian. He is friends with fellow German driver Nico Rosberg. Formula BMW and Formula Three. When Sutil moved up to the Formula BMW ADAC championship in 2003 he finished in sixth place in the series, but with no wins. The following season he stepped up to the Formula 3 Euroseries with Colin Kolles' team. Although he scored only twice, the connection he made with Kolles would prove useful in the future. He moved to the ASM team at the final round of the year. Sutil stayed with ASM for 2005 and was joined by British driver Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton won more races than Sutil, but the German was runner-up to Hamilton and the Briton's only serious competitor in the championship and at the Marlboro Masters of Formula Three at Zandvoort. Sutil missed the last two rounds of the 2005 Euroseries after joining A1 Team Germany for the inaugural A1 Grand Prix series. He raced for them at three events in Portugal, Australia and Dubai, his best result being two twelfth places. He spent 2006 racing in Japan and won the All-Japan Formula Three Championship. He showed a very strong performance all season. He also finished third in the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix and made a one-off appearance in Japanese Super GT. Midland (2006). That year also saw Sutil enter Formula One. In January, he was confirmed as one of the three test drivers for the new Midland F1 Racing team, along with Markus Winkelhock and Giorgio Mondini. This came thanks to his connections with Colin Kolles, who was then running the team. Sutil appeared for the team as the third driver at the European, French and Japanese Grands Prix. By the time of his third appearance, the outfit had been bought by Spyker Cars. At the end of the year, he was promoted to second driver for the season, having been signed on a multi-year contract by the Spyker MF1 Team. In an interview with the Official Formula One website, Sutil's first 2007 teammate, Christijan Albers, commented that ""Adrian is a good driver and he will be quick this year, but as a driver you should always be pushing to the limits without thinking what the guy in the car next to you is doing. But Adrian will be a good team-mate and it looks as though he's going to be a big talent the future"". Spyker (2007). During 2007, Sutil out-qualified and out-raced his team-mate Albers at all Grands Prix before the Dutchman was replaced by Sutil's countryman Markus Winkelhock, test driver for the team up until that time at the European Grand Prix. Sutil out-qualified Winkelhock, although the latter went on to lead the race and restart after a sudden downpour. Winkelhock resumed his third driver role for the following grand prix at Hungary when Japanese driver Sakon Yamamoto took over the second team seat. Sutil out-performed Yamamoto in the race, passing Honda drivers Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button. In the Hungarian Grand Prix, Sutil was the first Spyker driver in 2007 to beat another running classified finisher, Honda's Rubens Barrichello. For the Turkish Grand Prix, a B-spec car was expected for the Spyker team but it failed a rear crash test and Sutil continued to use the older spec car. After fuel pressure problems, he was forced to start the race from the pits and finished five laps behind. At Monza, despite the introduction of the B-spec Spyker F8-VII and due to the nature of the circuit, the Spykers were largely uncompetitive once again and Sutil finished 19th, again only in front of his team-mate. At the Belgian Grand Prix, the strengths of the B-spec car were fully evident with both Sutil and Yamamoto setting competitive times through the three practice sessions culminating in Sutil qualifying only half a second behind 16th placed man Vitantonio Liuzzi. During the race, Sutil passed the Toyota of Jarno Trulli, Hondas of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button as well as the Red Bull's David Coulthard, Toro Rosso's Vitantonio Liuzzi and Williams driver Alexander Wurz. He ran as high as 12th before finishing 14th. He was highly praised for his efforts by both team and media. Two weeks later in the rain at Fuji Speedway, Japan, it seemed Sutil had narrowly missed an opportunity to score Spyker's first ever point, briefly holding 8th position on the penultimate lap of the high-attrition race after Nick Heidfeld retired his BMW, but was almost immediately passed by fellow backmarker Vitantonio Liuzzi in the Toro Rosso and finished 9th. After the race it was found that Liuzzi had overtaken Sutil under yellow flags, and the 25-second penalty for the Italian promoted Sutil to the final points position. Toro Rosso appealed the decision, but the penalty was upheld. Spyker were not competitive in the final two races of the year, neither of which Sutil finished. He has been praised by many for his performances in the 2007 Formula One Championship. Despite driving the most uncompetitive car of the year, the German rookie impressed by not only dominating all of his teammates in both qualifying and race conditions, but also by challenging other drivers with superior equipment. Force India (2008–2011, 2013–). 2008. Sutil continued with the team in 2008 under its new identity as Force India, after briefly entertaining the possibility of a drive with McLaren or Williams. The first two races of the season ended with mechanical failures. While running in a very strong fourth position in Monaco with six laps remaining, he was hit in the rear by fifth placed Kimi Räikkönen who lost control of his car while braking for the harbour chicane. A crash a few laps earlier had resulted in the safety car being deployed, with Sutil losing his considerable lead over the Finnish driver. Sutil's car suffered damage to the rear diffuser, and he was forced to retire. Mike Gascoyne called for Räikkönen to be punished over the incident. No punishment, however, was given. However, Sutil had overtaken three cars under yellow flags and according to steward Paul Gutjahr, should he have reached the chequered flag, he would have been given a 25-second penalty which would have dropped him out of the point-scoring positions. On 17 October Force India announced they would keep Sutil for the 2009 season. 2009. Sutil and the Force India team started the year with a real optimism of points scoring finshes when the European part of the season started after the first four races. BBC commentator Martin Brundle expressed his personal view that: In Australia, after starting from 16th on the grid, Sutil progressed steadily through the field to finish just outside the points in 9th place. In Malaysia, he qualified 19th and finished 15th when the race was stopped on lap 33 due to torrential rain. In China, Sutil was running in 6th place with 6 laps remaining when he lost control of his Force India – due to aquaplaning – resulting in him crashing and forcing him to retire. In Bahrain, Sutil was penalised for blocking Mark Webber during the first qualifying session. He personally walked into Mark's room to apologise for the incident. In Spain, after running wide at the first corner of the first lap Sutil rejoined the track only to hit the Toyota of Jarno Trulli. The Italian had also run wide and was rejoining the track. This forced both drivers to retire and caused the two Toro Rossos of Sébastien Bourdais and Sébastien Buemi to crash into each other. In Monaco, Sutil finished 14th and finished 17th in Turkey, after qualifying a career-best of 15th. In qualifying in Britain, Sutil went off at Abbey corner after brake failure in Q1. Qualifying was red flagged and as a result no one else could post a lap time. This meant that Sutil was to start from 18th on the grid, although the team had hoped that both Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would get into Q2. Due to the damage caused by the accident he had to start from the pit lane because he needed to use a new car and a new engine, and went on to finish 17th in an uneventful race. In Germany, Sutil took advantage of the unpredictable conditions in qualifying, and secured his best-ever qualifying position of seventh. In the race, he was lying in second place for a while before his first pit stop. However, a collision with Kimi Räikkönen after coming out of the pit lane meant he had to pit again to replace his front wing. He finished 15th. It was the second time that a collision with Räikkönen cost Sutil the chance to score points, after the previous incident at the 2008 Monaco Grand Prix. In Hungary, he was forced to retire after just two laps because a water temperature problem caused the engine to overheat, after qualifying 17th. In Valencia, new aerodynamic upgrades for the VJM02 saw him qualify 12th, and he then raced steadily to finish 10th, demonstrating that the team were at last showing signs of competitiveness, as teammate Fisichella finished 12th behind Heidfeld's BMW Sauber. In Belgium, he qualified 11th, although the main celebrations in the Force India pit were for teammate Giancarlo Fisichella's excellent pole position. Sutil finished 11th, while Fisichella finished less than a second behind Kimi Räikkönen's race-winning Ferrari. At the , Sutil took his career best qualifying result of second place and finished fourth in the race behind Räikkönen, despite accidentally overshooting his mechanics during his final pit stop, but they suffered only minor injuries. He also recorded the fastest lap of the race, his first in Formula One and the first fastest lap recorded for Force India. In Singapore, Sutil was forced to retire after he collided with Nick Heidfeld of BMW Sauber, moving into his path as he recovered from a spin. After the race, Sutil was reprimanded by race stewards and fined $20,000 for causing an avoidable accident. In Japan, Sutil took his second best career qualifying result of fourth, but was given a 5 grid place penalty along with Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello and Fernando Alonso for not slowing down while yellow flags were waved (due to a crash by Sebastien Buemi, who was also demoted five places for attempting to drive his badly damaged Toro Rosso back to the pits) and started the race from eighth on the grid. Sutil finished 13th. In the wet qualifying session in Brazil, Sutil qualified third, but retired on lap one following a collision with the Toyota of Jarno Trulli. Out of control on the wet grass outside Turn 5, Trulli hit Sutil, and then slid back onto the track and struck Alonso's Renault, resulting in all three being out of the race. Trulli blamed Sutil for pushing him outside the track at the fifth corner and thus causing the accident, and furiously berated the German at the side of the track in full-view of worldwide TV cameras. This time the stewards took no action against Sutil for the accident, while Trulli was fined $10,000 for his unacceptable behaviour. The matter was not resolved however, as Sutil and Trulli still argued about the accident two weeks later at the driver's press conference for the . In Abu Dhabi, Sutil was unusually off the pace, qualifying only 18th on the grid. Although he overtook several cars during the race, a poor pit strategy resulted in Sutil finishing the race at the back of the field, scrapping with Fisichella (who had joined Ferrari) and Renault's Romain Grosjean. The German eventually finished 17th, 1 lap down but ahead of the Frenchman. 2010. Sutil was in talks with Force India to renew his contract, and on 27 November 2009, the team announced that the German's contract had been renewed, while test-driver Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a full-time race seat. Sutil qualified tenth for the first two races of the year, but a collision with Robert Kubica in Bahrain and a mechanical failure in Australia meant he was unable to score points in either race. However, Sutil commented that the performances proved that the team could now score points in dry races. This comment was backed up by Sutil's fifth-place finish in the following race in Malaysia. In China he finished 11th. In Spain he finished 7th and in Monaco he finished 8th. Sutil again finished in the points in Turkey with a 9th place. He followed this result with points scoring finishes in the next three rounds in Canada, Europe and Britain. 2011. Sutil remained with Force India for , and was joined by DTM champion Paul di Resta. In the first three races of the season, Sutil was out-qualified by di Resta. Sutil finished ninth in the , at the expense of the Sauber cars being disqualified from the race, having finished eleventh on the road. In Malaysia, Sutil finished eleventh, just behind di Resta, and in China, he qualified eleventh. In Monaco, he had his best result of the season, finishing seventh. He retired in Canada after hitting a wall, which resulted in damage to his car's suspension. A ninth place finish in Valencia was followed by eleventh at the , missing out on the final points-scoring position, held by Jaime Alguersuari, by just 0.6 seconds. At his home race, Sutil took a season best finish of sixth place, after implementing a different strategy to some of the drivers around him on the grid, making just two pit stops to the three made by his rivals. Despite qualifying in the top ten in Hungary, Sutil could only finish 14th, before another points-scoring finish – finishing seventh, after starting 15th on the grid after an accident in qualifying – at the . He retired at Monza after his car suffered a hydraulics problem, before an eighth place finish in Singapore, holding off a late-race challenge from Felipe Massa. In Japan, Sutil ran inside the top ten placings for much of the race, but finished the race just outside the points in eleventh place, having been passed by Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg in the closing stages of the race. Another eleventh place followed in Korea, before a ninth place finish in the inaugural race in India. At the final race in Brazil, Sutil matched his best finish of the season with sixth place, and as a result, moved into ninth place in the final championship standings. On 16 December 2011, Force India announced di Resta and Nico Hülkenberg would be their drivers for 2012, leaving Sutil without a seat. Shanghai nightclub incident and assault conviction. In the evening following the , Sutil was involved in an incident with Genii Capital CEO and owner of the Lotus F1 team Eric Lux in a nightclub in Shanghai, where he cut Lux in the neck with a champagne glass Sutil himself had broken. On 16 May 2011, Lux announced that he had filed a criminal complaint for physical assault and grievous bodily harm against Sutil. Force India owner Vijay Mallya backed up Sutil, saying that everyone need not be presumptive about the incident. He also refused to take action against Sutil until the case proceeded further. Sutil himself apologised for the incident, which he described as unintentional. On 13 January 2012, German prosecutors announced that Sutil would stand trial over the incident, charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. Sutil was convicted of the charge on 31 January 2012, for which he received an 18-month suspended prison sentence and was given a €200,000 fine, to be donated to charity. Sutil's former best friend Lewis Hamilton was also present in the nightclub. He was named as a witness by Sutil, but could not show up at court due to Hamilton having to be present at the launch of his team's car. He stated he would attend a retrial as he would not be occupied on the scheduled day should a retrial have taken place. As a result the friendship of the two race drivers ended. 2013. On 28 February 2013, Force India announced that Sutil would return to the team to complete their driver lineup alongside Paul Di Resta. He finished seventh at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, impressing on his comeback by leading for a number of laps throughout the race. In Malaysia, he retired from the race following problems with a new captive wheel nut system that the team introduced at the beginning of the season. He also retired from the Chinese Grand Prix when he was hit by Gutiérrez. "
wikipedia-4009986," Moses Harvey  Moses Harvey LL.D. (March 21, 1820 – September 3, 1901) clergyman, essayist and naturalist born Armagh, Ireland and died in St. John's, Newfoundland. Harvey was of Scottish descent and was educated at the Royal Academical Institute at Belfast. He became an ordained minister in the Presbyterian ministry in 1844. Harvey served at the John Street Presbyterian Church, Maryport, Cumberland, England until he emigrated to St. John's in 1852 with his bride Sarah Anne Browne. He served at St. Andrews Free Presbyterian Church in St. John's. His sermons there become an inspiration as a lecturer and a writer where he had written over 900 articles in a twenty-four year period that was published in the ""Montreal Gazette"" under the pen name ""Delta"". Harvey is the co-founder of the ""Evening Mercury"" newspaper. Harvey had studied many aspects of Newfoundland's natural history, most notably the habits of the giant squid. One species, ""Architeuthis harveyi,"" was named in recognition of his work. It was largely through his efforts that the giant squids became known to British and American zoologists. Harvey's interests in Newfoundland were varied, he had called for the creation of a cross-island railroad, he was president of the St. John's Athenaeum Society, he pressed for the development of mining in Newfoundland and he also catalogued the rocks, birds and wild flowers of the island. In 1885 he published the book ""Text Book of Newfoundland History."" His best-known and most prominent book was ""Newfoundland, The Oldest British Colony"" which he co-authored with Joseph Hutton and published in 1883. In 1886 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Royal Society of Canada in 1891. Harvey was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from McGill University in 1891. Harvey served as Secretary to the Newfoundland Fisheries Commission and had written and lectured a remarkable document entitled ""The Artificial Propagation of Marine Food Fishes and Edible Crustaceans,"" that was published in the Royal Society's transactions for 1892 — 1893, Vol. IX.

wikipedia-4009994," Canine discoid lupus erythematosus  Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is an uncommon autoimmune disease of the basal cell layer of the skin. It occurs in humans and cats, more frequently occurring in dogs. It does not progress to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in dogs. SLE can also have skin symptoms, but it appears that the two are either separate diseases or DLE is a mild form of SLE. DLE in dogs differs from SLE in humans in that plasma cells predominate histologically instead of T lymphocytes. Because worsening of symptoms occurs with increased ultraviolet light exposure, sun exposure most likely plays a role in DLE, although certain breeds (see below) are predisposed. After pemphigus foliaceus, DLE is the second most common autoimmune skin disease in dogs. Diagnosis. DLE is easily confused with solar dermatitis, pemphigus, ringworm, and other types of dermatitis. Biopsy is required to make the distinction. Histopathologically, there is inflammation at the dermoepidermal junction and degeneration of the basal cell layer. Unlike in SLE, an anti-nuclear antibody test is usually negative. Treatment. Avoiding sun exposure and the use of sunscreens (not containing zinc oxide, which is toxic to dogs) is important. Topical therapy includes corticosteroid use. Oral vitamin E or omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also used. More refractory cases may require the use of oral niacinamide and tetracycline, corticosteroids, azathioprine, or chlorambucil. Treatment is often lifelong, but there is a good prognosis for long-term remission. "
wikipedia-4010005," Outreau trial  The Outreau trial was a 2004 criminal trial in Northern France on various counts of sexual abuse against children. The trial and the appeal trial revealed that the main witness for the prosecution, convicted for the abuse, had lied about the involvement of other suspects, who were in fact innocent. Several innocent suspects had nevertheless spent years jailed on remand and one had committed suicide. The trials resulted in a national outrage in France, with journalists, politicians and the public opinion questioning how such a miscarriage of justice could happen, with innocent men and women being held for years in jail on unfounded suspicions. In January 2006, a parliamentary inquiry was created, with President Jacques Chirac calling the affair a ""judicial disaster"". The Outreau affair. The ""Outreau Affair"", which concerned an alleged criminal network in Outreau, a poor suburb of Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Pas-de-Calais region, began in November 2001. The first trial took place in Saint-Omer in 2004, and the appeal took place in Paris in 2005. Eighteen people were accused. Mostly parents, they were charged with child sexual abuse and incest and their children were separated from them for much of this time. The affair began when some school teachers and social workers noticed “strange sexual behavior” from four children in a local school. Psychologists believed the children to be credible witnesses, but doctors found no evidence of sexual abuse. The parents were accused on the testimony of some of the children, which was then backed-up by the confessions of some of the accused. The defendants were held in custody for from one to three years. In the first trial (in 2004), four of the eighteen admitted guilt and were convicted, seven denied involvement and were acquitted. Six further defendants denied the charges but were convicted and given light sentences - they appealed their convictions, and were heard by the Paris ""Cour d'assises"" in autumn 2005. On the first day of the hearing, the prosecution's claims were destroyed, and all six were acquitted. Another defendant had committed suicide in prison while awaiting trial. Judicial process. The first trial. The appeal took place before Saint-Omer's ""Cour d'assises"", composed of three professional judges and nine jurors. The case involved an alleged ring of 17 persons, with the charges based on one woman's evidence and some corroborating statements from alleged victims. The alleged offenders were condemned on the grounds of certain adults' and, most of all, the children's testimony, together with psychiatric evidence. The children's testimony took place in ""huis clos"" (behind closed doors); such a procedure is normal in France for victims of sexual abuse, especially minors. The six convicted persons who denied any responsibility appealed their convictions.  The woman who had given much of the evidence later confessed in court she had lied, and the children's revelations were found to be unreliable. Only four of the accused ever confessed, all the others insisted on their innocence: one committed suicide in jail during the investigation, 7 others were acquitted during the first trial in May 2004, the last 6 during the second trial on the evening of December 1, 2005. The second trial. The appeal took place before Paris' Cour d'assises, composed of three professional judges and twelve jurors, used as an appellate court for review of both facts and law. On its first day, the accusation's claims were dismissed, owing to the statement of the main prosecution witness, Myriam Badaoui, who had declared on November 18 that the six convicted persons ""had not done anything"" and that she had herself lied. Thierry Delay, her former husband, backed up her statement. During the trial, the psychological evidence was also called into question, as it appeared biased and lacking in weight. The denials of two children, who admitted that they had formerly lied, also contributed to the destruction of the prosecution's claims. One of the psychologists said on TV: ""I am paid the same as a cleaning lady, so I provide a cleaning lady's expertise,"" which caused further public indignation. At the end of the trial, the prosecutor (""avocat général"") asked for the acquittal of all of the accused persons. The defence renounced its right to plead, preferring to observe a minute of silence in favor of François Mourmand, who had died in prison during remand. Yves Bot, general prosecutor of Paris, came to the trial on its last day, without previously notifying the president of the Cour d'assises, Mrs. Mondineu-Hederer; while there, Bot presented his apologies to the defendants on behalf of the legal system—he did this before the verdict was delivered, taking for granted a ""not guilty"" ruling, for which some magistrates reproached him afterwards. All six defendants were finally acquitted on December 1, 2005, putting an end to five years of trials, which have been described by the French media as a ""judicial foundering"" or even as a ""judicial Chernobyl"". Remaining sentences. Four people remained convicted after the appeal trial: Myriam Badaoui (who had not appealed her conviction), her husband, and a couple of neighbours. Myriam Badaoui, her husband, and one of the neighbours confessed that they had wrongfully accused other people to have been involved in the abuse cases, whereas only the four of them had been involved. Myriam Badaoui was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, her husband to 20 years. Aftermath. Questioning on French justice and media involvement. The affair caused public indignation and questions about the general workings of justice in France. The role of an inexperienced magistrate, Fabrice Burgaud, fresh out of the ""Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature"" was underscored, as well as the undue weight given to children's words and to psychiatric expertise, both of which were revealed to have been wrong. The media's relation of the events was also questioned; although they were quick to point out the judicial error, they also had previously endorsed the ""Outreau affair"". Parliamentary inquiry. After the second trial, the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, the minister of justice Pascal Clément and President Chirac himself officially apologised to the victims in the name of the government and of the judicial institutions. In January 2006, there was a special parliamentary enquiry (for the first time broadcast live on television) about this ""catastrophe judiciaire"" (judicial disaster), which had been called by President Chirac in order to help prevent a recurrence of this situation through alterations in France's legal system. The role of experts (who had drawn hasty conclusions from children's testimony) and child protection advocates, lack of legal representation, the responsibility of the judges (the prosecution's case depended in this instance on a single investigative magistrate) and the role of the mass media was examined. The acquitted persons' hearing by the parliamentary enquiry caused a surge of emotion through the whole country. The affair was designated a ""judiciary shipwreck"". Fabrice Burgaud. On April 24, 2009, the Conseil supérieur de la magistrature sentenced Burgaud to a reprimand (""réprimande avec inscription au dossier""), the lowest penalty in the French judiciary system. Since then the case was ""dropped"". Today Burgaud is appealing his reprimand. Film. In 2011 a film, ""Presume coupable"" (English title: ""Guilty"") was released, a drama documentary about the case from the viewpoint of Alain Marecaux, one of the innocent defendants, based on his memoirs.

wikipedia-4010036," Medazepam  Medazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is known by the following brand names: Nobrium, Rudotel, Raporan, Ansilan and Mezapam. Medazepam is a long acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of medazepam is 36 – 200 hours. Pharmacology. Benzodiazepine drugs including medazepam increase the inhibitory processes in the cerebral cortex by allosteric modulation of the GABA receptor. Benzodiazepines may also act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibited depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experiments with cell components from rat brains. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high dose effects against seizures in a study. It has major active benzodiazepine metabolites which gives it a more prolonged therapeutic effects after administration. The Committee on the Review of Medicines. The Committee on the Review of Medicines (UK) carried out a review into benzodiazepines due to significant concerns of tolerance, drug dependence and benzodiazepine withdrawal problems and other adverse effects. The committee found that benzodiazepines do not have any antidepressant or analgesic properties and are therefore unsuitable treatments for conditions such as depression, tension headaches and dysmenorrhoea. Benzodiazepines are also not beneficial in the treatment of psychosis due to a lack of efficacy. The committee also recommended against benzodiazepines being used in the treatment of anxiety or insomnia in children. The committee was in agreement with the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA) that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics was beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3 to 14 days of continuous use and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after four months continuous use due to the development of tolerance. The committee found that the regular use of benzodiazepines caused the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremor, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal symptoms tended to develop within 24 hours on the cessation of a short-acting benzodiazepine and within 3 to 10 days after the cessation of a more long-acting benzodiazepine. Withdrawal effects could occur after treatment lasting only two weeks at therapeutic dose levels, however withdrawal effects tended to occur with habitual use beyond two weeks and were more likely the higher the dose. The withdrawal symptoms may appear to be similar to the original condition. The committee recommended that all benzodiazepine treatment be withdrawn gradually and recommended that benzodiazepine treatment be used only in carefully selected patients and that therapy be limited to short-term use only. It was noted in the review that alcohol can potentiate the central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepines and should be avoided. The central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepines may make driving or operating machinery dangerous and the elderly are more prone to these adverse effects. In the neonate, high single doses or repeated low doses have been reported to produce hypotonia, poor sucking, and hypothermia in the neonate and irregularities in the fetal heart. Benzodiazepines should be avoided in lactation. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhoea. Chemistry. 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine (5.1.40), has been suggested to be synthesized in various ways. The first is the reduction of the carbonyl group in diazepam by lithium aluminum hydride. The second way of making medazepam consists of the initial reduction of the carbonyl group by lithium aluminum hydride into 7-chloro-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin- 2-one—the first intermediate product in the synthesis of diazepam—which is synthesized by the cyclocondensation of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone with glycine ethyl ester into 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine, and the subsequent methylation of the secondary amine nitrogen atom of the resulting product by methyl iodide, using sodium hydride as a base. The third method of making medazepam consists of a new way of making 7-chloro-2,3- dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine, which consists in heterocyclization of 1-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-1-phenylimine with ethylenediamine. The starting 1-(2,5- dichlorophenyl)-1-phenylimine is synthesized by the reaction of 2,5-dichlorobenzonitrile with phenylmagnesium bromide. Finally, a method of making medazepam from 4-chloro-N-methylaniline is suggested. The last is reacted with ethyleneimine in the presence of aluminum chloride, giving N- (4-chlorophenyl)-N-methylethylenediamine. Acylation of the resulting product with benzoyl chloride gives the respective amide, which cyclizes into the desired medazepam using phosphorus oxychloride. See also:  Various modifications of the described methods have been suggested. "
wikipedia-4010072," Chengdu Shishi High School  Chengdu Shishi High School (Traditional Chinese: 石室中學，文翁石室，Simplified Chinese: 石室中学，文翁石室, pinyin: shíshì zhōngxúe, wén wēng shíshì) is a state secondary school in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. It stands on the site of the first local Chinese public school, founded in the Han Dynasty between 143 BC and 141 BC by Wén Wēng (文翁). ""Shishi"", which literally means ""Stone House"", refers to the original construction which was built of stones. History. In Chengdu between the years 143 and 141 BC, Wén Wēng (文翁) established the first local Chinese public school. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, Chengdu and the school were devastated by fire. The school was rebuilt in 194 AD. The school continued through the Northern Song Dynasty, but by the late Ming Dynasty only rubble remained. In 1661, early in the Qing Dynasty, a government school was established on the site, and became the leading school in Sichuan. Shishi Middle School became Chengdu Normal School (成都師範學堂) under the new educational system introduced in 1902 and then became Chengdu Middle School (成都府中學堂) in 1904. It was renamed again to Chengdu Shishi Middle School (成都石室中學) in February 1940, and in mid-1948 was identified as a model for secondary schools nationwide. In September 1952, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the school changed its name to Chengdu No. 4 Middle School (成都第四中学). During the Cultural Revolution the school was devastated for the third time; none of the Qing Dynasty buildings still exist. It returned to its former name in April 1983. Shishi ranks among the top 100 middle schools in China. Competition among junior middle school students in Chengdu for entry into the school is intense. For many students, acceptance into Shishi is an honor rivaling university acceptance and provides an opportunity to receive above average instruction in core classes. Most Shishi students scored among the top 10% of their peers on the junior middle school exit exam. "
wikipedia-4010106," Covenant of the League of Nations  The Covenant of the League of Nations was the charter of the League of Nations. Creation. Early drafts for a possible League of Nations began even before the end of the First World War. A London-based study group led by James Bryce and G. Lowes Dickinson made proposals adopted by the British League of Nations Society, founded in 1915. Another group in the United States—which included Hamilton Holt and William B. Howland at the Century Association in New York City—had their own plan. This plan was largely supported by the League to Enforce Peace, an organization led by former U.S. President William Howard Taft. In December 1916, Lord Robert Cecil suggested that an official committee be set up to draft a covenant for a future league. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918; it was led by Walter Phillimore (and became known as the Phillimore Committee) but also included Eyre Crowe, William Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was not impressed with the Phillimore Committee′s report, and would eventually produce three draft covenants of his own with help from his friend Colonel House. Further suggestions were made by Jan Christian Smuts in December 1918. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, a commission was appointed to agree on a covenant. Members included Woodrow Wilson (as chair), Colonel House (representing the U.S.), Robert Cecil and Cecil Hurst (Britain), Léon Bourgeois and Ferdinand Larnaude (France), Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando and Vittorio Scialoga (Italy), Foreign Minister Makino Nobuaki and Chinda Sutemi (Japan), Paul Hymans (Belgium), Wellington Koo (China), Jayme Batalha Reis (Portugal), and Milenko Radomar Vesnitch (Serbia). Further representatives of Czechoslovakia, Greece, Poland and Romania were later added. The group considered a preliminary draft co-written by Hurst and President Wilson′s adviser David Hunter Miller. The group met on ten occasions, and by 11 April 1919, the Hurst-Miller draft was approved with only a few changes. The League would be made up of a General Assembly (representing all member states), an Executive Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent secretariat. Member states were expected to ""respect and preserve as against external aggression"" the territorial integrity of other members, and to disarm ""to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety."" All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war. The Executive Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes. Major objections came from France and Japan. France wanted the League to form an international army to enforce its decisions, but the British worried such an army would be dominated by the French, and the Americans could not agree since only Congress could declare war. Makino and Chinda requested that a clause upholding the principle of racial equality should be inserted, parallel to the existing religious equality clause. This was deeply opposed, particularly by Americans, and Wilson simply ignored the question. While Wilson was away, a vote on a similar motion (supporting ""equality of nations and the just treatment of their nationals"") was supported by 11 of 19 delegates, but Wilson declared that ""serious objections"" by other delegates negated the majority vote, and the amendment was dismissed. The treaty entered into force on 10 January 1920. Articles 4, 6, 12, 13, and 15 were amended in 1924. The treaty shares similar provisions and structures with the UN Charter. "
wikipedia-4010259," House with Chimaeras  House with Chimaeras or Gorodetsky House (, ; , ) is an Art Nouveau building located in the historic Lypky neighborhood of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. Situated across the street from the President of Ukraine's office at No. 10, Bankova Street, the building has been used as a presidential residence for official and diplomatic ceremonies since 2005. The street in front of the building is closed off to all automobile traffic, and is now a patrolled pedestrian zone due to its near proximity to the Presidential Administration building. Architect Vladislav Gorodetsky originally constructed the House with Chimaeras for use as his own upmarket apartment building during the period of 1901–1902. However, as the years went by, Gorodetsky eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Gorodetsky's original plans. The building derives its popular name from the ornate decorations depicting exotic animals and hunting scenes, which were sculpted by Italian architect Emilio Sala since Gorodetsky was an avid hunter. The name does not refer to the chimaera of mythology, but to an architectural style known as chimaera decoration in which animal figures are applied as decorative elements to a building. Gorodetsky's unique architectural style earned him praise as the Antoni Gaudí of Kiev. History. Construction and early history. The House with Chimaeras was designed by the architect Vladislav Gorodetsky in 1901–1902. Gorodetsky was born in 1863 into a prosperous Polish szlachta family in the Podillia region. After finishing the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg in 1890, he moved to Kiev, where he lived for almost 30 years. At the time of the building's construction, Gorodetsky had already established himself as a prominent Kiev architect, having designed and constructed together with his close friend and partner engineer Anton Strauss many city buildings, from the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral to the Karaim Kenesa and what today is the National Art Museum of Ukraine. Besides architecture, Gorodetsky was also interested in big-game hunting, which explains why his building features many animals. Gorodetsky financed the house's construction with borrowed money, with the intent for it to be an apartment building. Each floor formed a single apartment, connected by an elevator and stairs. Gorodetsky himself occupied the fourth floor of the building, measuring at about . Gorodetsky bought the first lot of land on February 1, 1901, with construction work commencing on March 18 of that year. Construction of the exterior walls was finished by August 21, and the roof installed and all masonry work was completed on September 13. Due to the economic hardships within the Russian Empire, the completion of the building was delayed. In May 1903, only one apartment on the lowest level and Gorodetsky's own apartment were occupied. The total cost of the land and construction amounted to 133,000 rubles. In total, of land were used for construction of the building and cost a total of 15,640 rubles. The projected annual profit from the rentals was 7,200 rubles. A cowshed was located on the premises due to Gorodetsky's insistence on fresh in-house milk, though it was specifically placed in a way that the smell of the cows would not disturb the tenants. On a lot adjacent to the building, a miniature alpine garden (approx. ) and a fountain were built. Due to financial mismanagement which included his Safari hunting hobby, in July 1912, Gorodetsky pledged the building as a collateral against a loan taken from Kiev Mutual Credit Association. When Gorodetsky defaulted on the loan, the building was auctioned off in 1913, and became the property of the engineer Daniel Balakhovsky, the son of a Kiev trader, who was also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Blahodatinskoe sugar factory, and a French сonsular agent in Kiev. In 1916, the house belonged to the Blahodatinskoe sugar factory. In 1918, the building's ownership changed again, to Samuel Nemets. In 1921, after the Bolsheviks gained control of Kiev, several of the departments of the Kiev Military District took offices in the House with Chimaeras. Ownership 1921–2002. After the period of unrest following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the building was nationalized and later converted for communal living. Each apartment was occupied by about nine to ten families. During the Second World War (1941–1943), the building was abandoned. Due to exposure to the harsh elements during the war, the building suffered significant damage to its structure. After the war, the building was briefly used as a residence for evacuated actors from the Ivan Franko Theater; however, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic took ownership of the building and later transformed it into the Polyclinic (""clinic"") No. 1 for their elite. The polyclinic used the building up until the end of the 20th century. During that time, the building almost split in half. One part sagged , and a major vertical crack formed, having a width of about . Some of the building's architectural details had either been chipped away, or had cracked. The building's restoration work was scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded up all of the windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely. Reconstruction and official use. During the time of the restoration, conducted by ""UkrNIIProektRestavratsiya"" and headed by Natalia Kosenko, the workers unearthed the whole lower floor, which had been filled in during Soviet times to strengthen the building's foundation. Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Gorodetsky's original plans. The building was opened as a filial ""Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art"" of the National Museum of Arts in November 2004. It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors. In April 2005, the Kiev City Council submitted a bill for 104 million hryvnias (approx. US $20 million) to the Ukrainian Government for reconstruction and restoration of the House with Chimaeras. The Council also allowed the Ukrainian government to construct a new square (closing off all automobile traffic) in front of the building for use in official ceremonies. Since May 2005, the building has been an official presidential residence, used for official and diplomatic ceremonies. The House with Chimaeras was used as a meeting place between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin, when the latter visited Kiev on December 22, 2006. Included in the building are rooms for negotiations, tête-à-tête talks, the signing of official documents, as well as a special room for the press. Architecture. The building was designed in the Art Nouveau style, which was at that time a relatively new style and featured flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Gorodetsky featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the Gaudí of Kiev. Due to the steep slope on which the building is situated, it had to be specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Gorodetsky somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.  The Italian sculptor Emilio Sala was responsible for both the internal and external sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs on the roof of the building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers depicting huge catfish strangled in the stems of lotus flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Gorodetsky was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the building material.  Floor plan. The House with Chimaeras was designed in such a way that the tenants would occupy the whole floor, each floor had all the necessary household rooms ranging from private kitchens to small powder rooms. The open floor plan and extra rooms featured throughout the building are characteristic of the houses of the wealthy of the early 20th century. In total, the building has an area of . On the lowest level of the building, which is located deep in the hill, were two stables, two rooms for coachmen, a shared laundry, and two separate apartments. Each of the two apartments consisted of a foyer, a kitchen, one bathroom, and a storage room. The first of these apartments had two residential rooms, and the second three rooms. Each floor above the lowest level was designed to house a single apartment only. The apartment on the second floor consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance. The grandest apartment, which belonged to Gorodetsky, consisted of a study, a great room and a living room, a dining room, a boudoir, a bedroom, a children's room, a room for a governess, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Gorodetsky's apartment. The apartment on the top floor had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city. Legends. Throughout the years, the unusual nature of the House with Chimaeras has given rise to a number of stories occasionally repeated in guide-books or newspapers, which are however either untrue or lacking any verifiable source.  According to the first legend, Vladislav Gorodetsky's daughter had committed suicide jumping into Dnieper River either because of some unfortunate love affair or because of a family feud. As a result, Gorodetsky went slightly mad and built this gloomy house in his daughter's memory. A second legend has it that Gorodetsky made a bet with some other architects, including the architect Alexander Skobelev, who had tried to prove that was impossible to build a house on such terrain, because the site (near the Ivan Franko Theater) overhangs a swamp (""Koz'ye boloto""). The Construction Committee of Kiev had prohibited construction of any structures on this particular lot, but eventually the construction of the building allowed Gorodetsky to win the bet. According to the third legend, Gorodetsky had cursed the house when forced to leave it in 1913 (due to his inability to repay his creditors); all of the house's tenants would be either unhappy or would meet some sort of financial misfortune. There is a story that all the businesses who rented a portion of the building either went bankrupt, had their funds stolen or were disbanded. In media. Russian science fiction writer Vladimir Vasilyev featured the House with Chimaeras in his 2003 novel, ""Black Palmira's Face"", where the building served as the headquarters for the fictional Day Watch organization in the city of Kiev.

wikipedia-4032009," Tuxford  Geography. Tuxford is a village and a civil parish on the southern edge of the Bassetlaw district of Nottinghamshire, England. It may also be considered a small town as it was historically a market town. Nearby larger towns are Retford and Newark-on-Trent. From Harvest Cottage, near the East Coast main railway line, the southern boundary of the parish is also the boundary of Bassetlaw. It meets Weston and follows Goosemoor Dyke. To the south, in Newark and Sherwood, is Egmanton, on the opposite side of Goosemoor Dyke. At the point where the boundary crosses the railway to Ollerton, it meets Kirton. At Priors Park Farm where it crosses the A6075, it meets Walesby (in Newark and Sherwood). At Willoughby Hill next to the British Telecom mast, on south of Farleys Wood, the parish boundary leaves the district boundary of Bassetlaw, and it meets West Markham. Directly south of West Markham, the boundary meets East Markham and to the east is Fledborough.  The Great North Road runs through the village (now B1164), though the majority of traffic now uses the modern A1 trunk road, which splits the village in two. The village was bypassed in July 1967. The section of road, known as Carlton to Markham Moor, was built by Robert McGregor & Sons, with concreting aggregates supplied by Hoveringham Gravels (later bought by Tarmac). The eight-mile section was authorised by Tom Fraser with a contract for £2.7 million, but ended up costing £3.4 million. The section is notable for the first use in British construction of the slip form paver using pervious concrete. The A6075 passes through east-west and connects the A57 to Ollerton and Mansfield. The East Coast Main Line passes close to the east. History. Tuxford has formerly been known as Tuxford in the Clays, Tuckers Ford, and in the Domesday Book as Tuxfarne. The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas dates from the 12th century. Tuxford also has a Methodist church, whose current building was erected for another Free church in 1841. Tuxford's local library is housed in a 17th century building that was originally the Read Grammar School. The school was founded in 1669 by the bequest of Charles Read (1604–1669), who was born at Darlton about from Tuxford, and became a wealthy shipper in Kingston upon Hull. Read also founded grammar schools at Corby Glen in Lincolnshire and Drax in Yorkshire. Read Grammar School in Tuxford closed in either 1912 or 1915. The building served for a time as a child welfare centre before becoming the local library. Tuxford has a village lock-up: one of only three in Nottinghamshire. Built in 1823 it stands [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/118629] on the village green in Newcastle Street. It has two separate cells, one each for men and women, each with its own earth closet. Ventilation to each cell is via two circular holes, with iron bars on the front and back walls. In 1884 an extension was added to the back of the lock-up to house Tuxford's fire engine. Early maps show that also behind the lock-up was the village pinfold, which remained in use until the 1920s. Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (Dosco) make mining equipment in the village. Tuxford Windmill is a tower windmill, built in 1820 and restored to working order between 1982 and 1993. It is open to visitors daily except Tuesdays throughout the year. The mill with its large white sails dominates Tuxford's skyline. The mill produces flour which is sold from the mill shop. The mill bakery produces cakes, soups & rolls. A wooden post mill once stood close by. It was moved from Grassthorpe in 1874, continued working until about 1926 and was demolished in 1950. Stone Road End Mill was a brick-built four-storey tower windmill, built before 1840. The mill was out of use by 1906 and now only the 38 foot high tower remains. Railway stations. Despite its small size, Tuxford had three railway stations but all are now closed. The Great Northern Railway opened the East Coast Main Line through Tuxford in 1852. The GNR's station at Tuxford was served by local trains between Newark-on-Trent and Retford. In 1897 The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway opened its line through Tuxford, linking Sheffield and Chesterfield with Lincoln. The LDECR called its station Tuxford Town, and the GNR renamed its station Tuxford North. In 1907 the Great Central Railway took over the LDECR and renamed Tuxford Town Tuxford Central. Dukeries Junction station was built where the two railways cross, and was a split-level affair with platforms on both lines, existing solely as an interchange point surrounded by open fields with no proper road access. Its name was taken from The Dukeries district of Nottinghamshire. In March 1950 British Railways closed Dukeries Junction station. It had had minimal use throughout its life. In July 1955 BR closed Tuxford North and withdrew passenger services from the former LDECR line in September of the same year, resulting in the closure of Tuxford Central. The former LD&ECR railway line has since been reopened by Network Rail in 2009 as the High Marnham Test Track for testing trains between Thoresby Jn and High Marnham at speeds of up to 75mph, with extensive sidings and mock OHL electrification being built at Tuxford approximately 5 miles away from the former Tuxford Central Station. Amenities. There is a Co-op on Newcastle Street in addition to several village pubs. Education. Tuxford Academy opened as a County Secondary School (Secondary modern school) in 1958 and became a comprehensive in 1976. It performs very well compared with most of Nottinghamshire, and especially with most of Bassetlaw. Tuxford School recently underwent a full re-build, completed in March 2007. A company called Transform Schools (mainly represented by building company Balfour Beatty) spent millions of pounds re-building six secondary schools within the Bassetlaw area as part of a PFI funded project. The new Tuxford School is located on what used to be the old school field along with a field next to it which has been bought over. The site where the old school stood has now been converted into the new school playing field and nature areas. Tuxford Academy has, surprisingly, only had three head teachers during its lifetime to date: Bernard Woodward, Keith Atkinson, and Chris Pickering. The school has steadily increased in size (now 1450 students) and reputation, and is one of the highest performing state secondary schools in Nottinghamshire, having gained an OfSTED grade of 'outstanding' in May 2009. It has been designated as a National Support School, is a specialist Technology College and Training School, and leads loose federations of secondary and primary schools in Nottinghamshire. It is well known for its welcoming atmosphere and innovative practices in education. Tuxford also has a community primary school. Sport. Tuxford has four youth football teams. Tuxford Gladiators are an U9s team and Tuxford YFC are under 14's both teams compete in the Newark Youth League. These two teams are managed by a local firefighter and police sergeant. Tuxford YFC under 15's also play in the Mansfield League and the under 12s play in Newark.  The footballer Craig Disley comes from Tuxford. He played for Mansfield Town 1999-2004 and now plays for Grimsby Town.  On 7 November 2011, the London 2012 Olympic Organising Committee announced that the Olympic Torch would travel through Tuxford on 28 June 2012 on its way from Lincoln to Nottingham. "
wikipedia-4032012," Jerry Haynes  Jerome Martin ""Jerry"" Haynes (January 31, 1927 – September 26, 2011) was an American actor from Dallas, Texas. He is most well known as Mr. Peppermint, a role he played for 30 years as the host of one of the longest-running local children's shows in television, the Dallas-based ""Mr. Peppermint"" (1961–1969), which was retitled ""Peppermint Place"" for its second run (1975–1996). He also had a long career in local and regional theater and appeared in more than 50 films. A 1944 graduate of Dallas' Woodrow Wilson High School, he was the father of musician and lead singer Gibby Haynes of the group Butthole Surfers. Early life. He was born in Dallas, Texas to Louise Schimmelpfennig Haynes and Fred Haynes. In 1990, Haynes was inducted into Woodrow Wilson High School's Hall of Fame. Jerry graduated from Southern Methodist University after attending Louisiana State University and Yale. Acting career. The ""Mr. Peppermint"" years. Haynes began his most famous role in 1961, playing a character who wore a red- and white-striped jacket and straw hat and carried a candy-striped magic cane. The original show ran for nine years as a live show, with Mr. Peppermint talking with a variety of puppet characters and including everything from cartoons to French lessons.  Early in the run of his show, an accident of fate made Haynes the first to report the Kennedy assassination on local news, together with his program director, Jay Watson. During lunch on the day of the shooting, the two men watched the Presidential motorcade pass on Main Street, and less than a minute later heard the deadly shots after the limousine turned onto Elm Street. The men quickly located and interviewed eyewitnesses, going on the air shortly later: During these early years, the show began at 7:30 AM and ran for one hour, competing in its last half hour with the national CBS broadcast of ""Captain Kangaroo"" but usually winning its time slot. National trends shifted, however, and in 1970, the show was replaced by a talk program for the adult audience. After the Federal Communications Commission called in 1975 for more educational programming for children, the show was retooled as ""Peppermint Place,"" a taped half-hour magazine-style program. The show continued in that format for over 20 years, eventually being syndicated to 108 markets nationwide before ending its run in 1996. Other television and film work. Most of Haynes' film career was in made-for-television films, especially those set in his native Texas. His first film role was in the 1981 docudrama ""Crisis at Central High"", about the integration of Little Rock's Central High School, filmed in Dallas. Texas-themed films in which he has appeared — mostly based on true stories — include ""Houston: The Legend of Texas"" (1986), ""A Killing in a Small Town"" (1990, aka ""Evidence of Love""), ""Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story"" (1992), ""Texas Justice"" (1995), ""Don't Look Back"" (1996), and ""It's in the Water"" (1997). His chief feature film roles included 1984's ""Places in the Heart"", as Deputy Jack Driscoll, and in the 1985 Patsy Cline biopic ""Sweet Dreams"" as Owen Bradley, Cline's record producer. He also played minor roles in ""RoboCop"" (1987) and ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999).  He also appeared as himself, partly through archive footage, in four documentary films discussing the Kennedy assassination: ""Rush to Judgment"" (1967), ""11-22-63: The Day the Nation Cried"" (1989), ""Stalking the President: A History of American Assassins"" (1992), and ""Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film"" (1998). In 1996 the Lone Star Film & Television Awards honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. He regularly appeared in the Red River, New Mexico, Fourth of July parade in a candy-striped Jeep. Health. Haynes was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in early 2008, and then was later diagnosed with a heart condition for which he received an artificial pacemaker. His doctors later revised their opinions to determine that he had a less aggressive form of Parkinson's. Haynes died on September 26, 2011, from complications due to the diseases. He was 84. "
wikipedia-4032051," Business simulation  Business simulation is simulation used for business training or analysis. It can be scenario-based or numeric-based. Most business simulations are used for business acumen training and development. Learning objectives include: strategic thinking, financial analysis, market analysis, operations, teamwork and leadership. The business gaming community seems lately to have adopted the term business simulation game instead of just gaming or just simulation. The word simulation is sometimes considered too mechanistic for educational purposes. Simulation also refers to activities where an optimum for some problem is searched for, while this is not usually the aim of an educational game. On the other hand, the word game can imply time wasting, not taking things too seriously and engaging in an exercise designed purely for fun. The concept of simulation gaming seems to offer the right combination and balance between the two. Simulation gaming is also the term that the educational gaming community has adopted. Games and Business simulation games. Partly, the terminology of business simulation games is not well established. The most common term used is business game but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments. Klabbers (1999) notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent: Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior. Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems. In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources. Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association (ISAGA) was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall. Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development. In most cases, the terms business (simulation) game and management (simulation) game can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al. determine a business game (or business simulation) as ""a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation"". The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester and Naylor do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise. Gredler divides experiential simulations into the following four categories: Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal. Business strategy games are intended to enhance students’ decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information. They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company’s share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player’s initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative. In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions – on price, advertising, production targets, etc. – about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods. According to Senge and Lannon in managerial microworlds – like business simulation games – unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such ""virtual worlds"" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts. Naylor in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of (a) a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and (b) the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports – for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports – at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003). History. The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess. In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Diskinson). Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system. Greenlaw et al. state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing. According to Naylor, the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990). A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989) mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the USA in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner. At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the USA, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games. The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors: the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes. Larsen and Lomi describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry’s problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference – or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted: In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as ""experiential learning."" By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills with the softer - interpersonal - skills required for effective leadership development. Scenario simulations. In a business game or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to role-play simulations. Numeric simulations. A numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes. In a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers. The decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs, e.g. price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e.g. an income statement, a balance sheet and a cash flow statement. Feedback is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals, such as when a year has passed. Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors. Types of Business Simulation Games. Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs, which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al. The Simulation Gaming Process. Business simulation game developers regard their artefacts to be learning environments. When arguing for this, they most often refer to David A. Kolb's influential work in the field of experiential learning. During the last decades also ideas from constructivism have influenced the learning discussion within the simulation gaming field. The activities carried out during a simulation game training session are: The last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing. Debriefing is the most important part of the simulation/gaming experience. We all learn from experience, but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost. Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization. Thiagarajan lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements: Van Ments notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990). The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome. "
wikipedia-4032123," Canon EOS-1N  The EOS-1N is a 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) camera body produced by Canon. It was announced by Canon in 1994, and was the professional model in the range, superseding the original EOS-1. The camera was itself superseded by the EOS-1v in 2000. The original EOS-1 had been launched in 1989, two years after the company had introduced their new EOS autofocus system. It was the company's first professional-level EOS camera and was aimed at the same photographers who had used Canon's highly respected, manual focus professional FD mount SLRs, such as the Canon New F-1 and the Canon T90. On a physical level the EOS-1 resembled the T90, which had been designed for Canon by Luigi Colani. The EOS-1N was a revision of the EOS-1, with five autofocus points spread across the frame rather than a single centrally-mounted autofocus point, plus more effective weather sealing, a wider exposure range, and numerous other improvements. In common with the EOS-1, the 1N used Canon's A-TTL automatic flash system, and does not support the more modern E-TTL. Features. At the time of its creation, The Canon EOS-1N was placed at the top of Canon's EOS camera line. The camera featured polycarbonate external construction with weather-resistant seals around buttons, dials and its Canon EF lens mount. The fixed eye-level pentaprism viewfinder has 100-percent vertical and horizontal coverage, has dioptric viewfinder adjustment from –3 to +1 diopter and has as a viewfinder eyepiece blind to block stray light when on a tripod.  For automatic focusing, the camera used a 5-point BASIS auto focus system with the sensors arranged horizontally across the middle of the viewing area. The center point is a cross-type, which detects horizontal and vertical lines, while the outer four detect vertical lines only.  Metering modes include a 16-zone evaluative, center-weighted average, partial, selectable spot, and fine central spot metering mode. Film speeds can be set from ISO 6-6400 either manually or automatically by DX codes on the film canisters. The camera allows variable Program autoexposure, as well as aperture-priority and shutter-priority automatic exposure and manual exposure. Another option is Depth-of-field AE (DEP), an automatic mode that selects the focusing distance and aperture f-number to place the depth of field between two user-specified near and far points. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 of a second in all exposure modes. A non-timed bulb speed is available. Flash X-sync is available up to a shutter speed of 1/250 of a second.  There are 14 custom functions to change the way the camera operates, which set options like exposure steps and mirror lock-up.  The camera has user-interchangeable focusing screens, interchangeable with those out of other EOS-1-series cameras, and a now-discontinued interchangeable Canon Command Back E1.  Power comes from one 2CR5 battery, an optional BP-E1 Battery Pack housing four AA alkaline or lithium batteries or the PB-E1 Power Booster drive housing eight AA batteries and allowing for 6 frames per second to be photographed, depending on the type of battery and the shutter speed selected.  The camera weighs in at 855 grams, or 1 lb and 14.15 oz. Background. There were several versions of the EOS-1N available. The base model EOS-1N consisted of the standard camera body with significant upgrades over the EOS 1, launched in 1989. The EOS-1N DP comprised the standard body and the BP-E1 pack (see below) and the EOS-1N HS comprised the standard body plus booster (see below). One feature the EOS-1N (and previous/subsequent '1' models) lacks, which lower models in the range have, is built-in flash, intentionally omitted to provide an overall very rigid camera body able to withstand severe treatment by professionals. Weather sealing was incorporated after feedback from working professionals. Other notable omissions are the eye-controlled focus feature of the EOS 5 and the bar code reader of the EOS 10, neither of which are professional-level cameras. Another feature of the EOS-1N, and other professional models in the range, is the provision for a precise viewfinder indication of exposure in manual mode. This had previously been provided in fully manual cameras such as the F-1, but older Canon cameras with automatic exposure modes merely provided a recommended exposure reading in manual mode, leaving the user to accept the offered settings or not. The EOS-1N provides a viewfinder readout similar to the old F-1's needle display, but in electronic LCD form showing steps in 0.3, 0.5 or 1 stops. Like the EOS 5, the internal displays of the EOS 1N self-adjust in brightness in response to the brightness level of the subject. The optional Power Booster PB-E1 or Battery Pack BP-E1 attach to the base of the camera. The booster (PB-E1) holds 8 AA batteries or an optional Ni-Cad pack, and boosts the standard drive from 3 frames per second to 6. The Power Booster E1 has its own shutter release and input dial for use when shooting in the vertical format. The battery pack (BP-E1) is a lighter and simpler accessory. This holds 4 AA cells and a lithium battery, and you can select between the two power sources with a switch. It provides a grip for vertical shots but no additional controls. The major appeal of the Battery Pack BP-E1 is that is lighter and less expensive than the power booster. In addition to the standard EOS-1N there was another, specialised model in the range — the EOS-1N RS, introduced in 1995, with a permanently attached power drive booster. This camera has a fixed pellicle mirror so there is no viewfinder black-out at the moment of exposure. The fixed mirror allows high-speed continuous shooting at a top speed of 10 frames per second, with a shutter release lag as low as 6 ms. There is a cost to this however: slightly less light reaches the film, as some is always being directed up to the viewfinder. By the time of the release of the next generation EOS 1V, considerable technical improvements to the standard camera design meant that Canon no longer offered RS model variants. The EOS 1N was discontinued in 2001 with the arrival of the EOS 1V. Digital. During the late 1990s, Canon and Kodak collaborated on a range of professional digital SLRs which combined Canon EOS-1N bodies with Kodak digital sensors and electronics. They were Canon's first ventures into the digital SLR marketplace and divided into two distinct generations. The first generation was the Kodak EOS DCS series of 1995, which encompassed the 6 mp EOS DCS 1, the 1.5 mp DCS 3, and the 1.3 mp DCS 5. The EOS 1N camera bodies were almost unmodified from stock configuration, and were mounted on a removable Kodak digital back. The relationship continued with the Kodak DCS 500 series, which fully integrated the EOS-1N body with Kodak's imaging components. The range consisted of the 2 mp DCS 520 and the 6 mp DCS 560. The two cameras were also sold by Canon, as the Canon EOS D2000 and D6000 respectively. Canon's subsequent professional digital SLRs were produced independently of Kodak, and were initially based on the Canon EOS-1V, before moving to custom-designed digital bodies. "
wikipedia-4032178," Norbuprenorphine  Norbuprenorphine is the primary active metabolite of buprenorphine. Norbuprenorphine acts as a μ-opioid, δ-opioid, and nociceptin receptor full agonist, as well as a κ-opioid receptor partial agonist. Norbuprenorphine crosses the blood-brain-barrier similarly to buprenorphine and likely contributes to its effects. It was observed that Intravenous administration of norbuprenorphine at 1 to 3 mg/kg decreased respiratory rate, whereas buprenorphine had no effect up to 3 mg/kg in rats.  "

wikipedia-4032249," Todd McFarlane's Spawn  ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" is an animated television series which aired on HBO from 1997 through 1999. It is also released on DVD as a film series. It is based on the Spawn comic series from Image Comics, and was nominated for and won an Emmy in 1999 for Outstanding Animation Program (longer than one hour). An unrelated series titled """" is in production since 2009, with Keith David reprising his role as the titular character. Like the comic book, the series features graphic violence, sexual scenes, and extensive use of profanity. Todd McFarlane's Spawn was ranked 5th on IGN's list of The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons Of All Time. Plot. The series centered around the story of an ex-serviceman named Al Simmons, who fought in the Vietnam War as a commando. He was betrayed and killed by a man whom he believed to be his close friend (the man, Chapel, burned him alive with a flamethrower). Upon his death, Simmons vowed revenge on Chapel and hoped that he would one day return to his beloved wife Wanda. In order to accomplish his vow, he makes a pact with the Malebolgia (who was the overlord on the eighth plane of Hell). The pact was a simple one: Simmons would become a Soldier in Malebolgia's army (known as the ""Hellspawn"" or ""Spawn"" for short) in return for the ability to walk the earth once again in order to see Wanda. However, Simmons was tricked and his body was not returned to him; instead he had been given a different body which was a festering, pungently cadaverous, maggot-ridden walking corpse that had a massive living red cape attached to it. The head of this new body had been rotten for some time and was in an advanced state of decay, which led to Simmons donning a mask in order to cover its grotesque appearance. Upon his return to ""life"", Spawn seeks out Wanda, who had apparently got over the grief of having lost Al and married another man, Al's best friend Terry Fitzgerald with whom she seemingly had a daughter, Cyan. Terry, a respectable man, works for a man named Jason Wynn. Wynn is a black-market arms dealer, amongst other things (such as the head of certain government organizations, one of which dispatched Al and his team to Vietnam), and is revealed to be the man responsible for the death of Al Simmons due to a disagreement the two had between each other. Jason's actions would also prove dangerous to the lives of Terry, Wanda and their daughter as well. Realizing that he is no longer the man in Wanda's life, Al swears to protect her and her new family. The series depicts Spawn nesting in the dark alleyways, killing any who invade his new-found territory. Rejecting these actions as unworthy of Spawn's time and power, Malebolgia then dispatches another of his minions (a demonic creature known as the Violator that assumes the form of an obese clown) to try to sway Spawn into committing acts of violence and savagery in the name of Hell. Spawn struggles to fight the lure of evil as well as seeking to escape being hunted by not only the forces of Hell but also must defend himself from assailants from Heaven, who have a need to destroy the Hellspawn in order to cripple the forces of Hell so they do not gain an edge in the escalating war between the two spiritual hosts. As the war intensifies, the line between the forces of good and evil become increasingly blurry. Spawn finds help along the way in the form of a dishevelled old man named Cogliostro who was once a Hellspawn that overcame the demonic powers resting within, amongst a number of other characters.  In the last episodes of the series, Spawn learns how to shape shift, and appearing as Terry makes love to Wanda, impregnating her. It is revealed that there is a prophecy that the child of a Hellspawn will play the deciding factor in Armageddon, and may be the real reason Spawn was allowed to return to Earth. Home Video. All three seasons have been released separately on DVD & VHS as three 2 hour movies, under the titles ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"", ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2"", and ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle"" after editing these seasons into movies. On July 24, 2007, HBO Video released a 4-disc 10th anniversary signature collector's edition on DVD with all 18-episodes and multiple bonus features. When the show's first and second seasons were released on video they were released in two formats. The first format was called the ""Uncut Collector's Edition"", which is the version that was shown on TV and held a TV-MA rating, and the other was an special edited version called the ""Special Edited Edition"" which held a PG-13 rating by toning down the violence. The first movie was also released in the UMD format for Sony's PSP handheld video game system, but the other two movies were not. "
wikipedia-4032491," Marion Eugene Carl  Major General Marion Eugene Carl, USMC, (November 1, 1915 – June 28, 1998) was a World War II fighter ace, record-setting test pilot, and naval aviator. During World War II, he became the first-ever Marine Corps ace. Early years. Born on the family farm near Hubbard, Oregon, Carl was always attracted to aviation. He learned to fly while attending college and soloed after merely 2½ hours of instruction. (Eight to ten hours is typical.) He studied engineering at Oregon State College (now a university) and, in 1938, graduated as a lieutenant in the Army Reserve. Marine Corps career. Carl resigned his commission to become a naval aviation cadet and received his ""wings of gold"" and Marine Corps commission in December 1939. Carl's first posting was to Marine Fighting Squadron One (VMF-1) at Quantico, Virginia which lasted for one year. Ordered back to Pensacola, Carl served as an instructor pilot helping to train the rapidly growing number of naval aviators, before receiving orders to the newly formed Marine Fighting Squadron 221 (VMF-221) at NAS North Island in San Diego, California. World War II. The 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor found VMF-221 preparing to embark aboard the USS ""Saratoga"" for transport to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Carl, along with the rest of VMF-221 was hurriedly rushed to Hawaii, and then included in the Wake Island Relief Task Force, still aboard the ""Saratoga"". After the relief attempt was canceled, VMF-221 was deployed to Midway Atoll on Christmas Day, 1941. Carl's first combat occurred six months later during the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, when 15 of the 25 aircraft VMF-221 put into the air that morning were destroyed. Nevertheless, Carl was credited with destroying one enemy aircraft, a Mitsubishi Zero. Along with the other survivors from VMF-221, Carl was flown back to Hawaii shortly after the battle.  Granted a short rest period, Carl was reassigned to Marine Fighting Squadron 223 (VMF-223) commanded by a former squadron mate from VMF-221, Captain John L. Smith. On August 20, VMF-223 was deployed to Guadalcanal, the first fighter unit ashore with the Cactus Air Force. Over the next two months, he became the Marines' first ace, running his tally to 16.5 victories, though he was shot down once and was forced to bail out. It is believed that on August 26 Carl shot down the famous Japanese Navy ""Tainan Kokutai"" ace Junichi Sasai over Henderson Field. When the squadron left Guadalcanal in October, Carl was America's second-ranking ace behind his commanding officer, Major John L. Smith. In 1943, then Major Carl returned to the Pacific and led VMF-223 until the following summer. During additional combat in the Solomon Islands, he claimed two more enemy planes, finishing as the Corps' seventh ranking ace with 18.5 victories. Test pilot. In 1945, Carl graduated in the first test pilot class at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. As a lieutenant colonel, he conducted pioneering jet operations from aircraft carriers and later commanded VMF-122, the first Marine jet squadron. He was also the first Marine to pilot a helicopter. In 1947, Carl was one of two pilots selected to fly the Douglas D-558/I Skystreak in record-setting speed attempts. That August, he was recorded at , establishing a new world record. When Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in October, he also broke Carl's record. At Patuxent River on April 1, 1952, Carl had a close brush with death. He was performing a series of check spins in the new Grumman AF-2S Guardian anti-submarine attack aircraft. The anti-spin parachute that had been fitted in earlier tests had been removed. Climbing to over Chesapeake Bay, Carl commenced the spin. The aircraft entered a flat spin with strong centrifugal forces. Carl could not break the spin and rode it down to . He tried to operate the ejection seat, but the face blind ripped away in his hands and the seat failed to fire. He climbed out at . He then tried the wind-tunnel approved method of getting out on the inside of the spin, but was forced back due to airflow. He finally got out on the other side and felt his parachute open as he fell into the splash of the aircraft. The success of this proved bailing out on the inside of the spin to avoid being hit by the tail was an incorrect theory. During a second test pilot tour in 1953, Carl set an unofficial altitude record of in the Douglas D-558/II. Between test pilot duties, Carl commanded other units including a reconnaissance squadron based on Taiwan. In 1954, he led missions over Mainland China, photographing Communist forces along the coast. After his death, a corrupted version of his reconnaissance missions appeared in several obituaries, stating that he had flown U-2 spy planes. Vietnam War. Though still a colonel, Carl became Director of Marine Corps Aviation for five months in 1962. Two years later, he was promoted to brigadier general and, in 1965, he took the First Marine Brigade to Danang, South Vietnam. Despite his seniority, he repeatedly flew combat missions in helicopter gunships and jet fighters. Carl received his second star as a major general in 1967, commanding the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina from 1968 to 1970. He subsequently served as Inspector General of the Marine Corps, until retiring in 1973. At that time, he had logged some 13,000 flying hours, more than twice as much as most contemporaries. Murder. Carl returned to his native Oregon, where he and his wife Edna settled near Roseburg. Marion Carl's memoir, ""Pushing the Envelope"", coauthored with his friend Barrett Tillman, was published in 1994. In 1998, at age 82, he was shot to death with a shotgun during a robbery, defending Edna from a home invader. Carl was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His murderer, 19-year-old Jesse Fanus, was apprehended one week later. In April 1999, he was convicted on two counts of aggravated murder (and 11 additional felony charge) and sentenced to death. In 2003, his conviction and death sentence was upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court. In December 2011, the sentence was overturned. Awards and legacy. His decorations include (having declined any personal medals for service in Vietnam):  "
wikipedia-4032505," Fiscal conservatism  Fiscal conservatism is a term usually used to designate particular fiscal policy ideas, often as a synonym for ""fiscal responsibility."" It is most commonly used in reference to American politics, but has some scope in other English-speaking countries. As an ideology, fiscal conservatism is most strongly associated with restraint in government spending and debt. Free trade, deregulation, lower taxes, and other conservative policies are also often, but not necessarily, affiliated with fiscal conservatism. Advocates of fiscally conservative policies may cite Edmund Burke as an ideological forbear. In his ""Reflections on the Revolution in France"", Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: ...is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[The public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large. Present-day self-labelled fiscal conservatives often differ on their approach to reaching their goals: ""Deficit hawks"" are generally willing to increase taxes in addition to cutting spending to balance the budget, while ""libertarians"" frequently advocate ""starving the beast"" by cutting taxes for the purpose of decreasing tax revenue which they hope will cause the government to spend less, and ""supply-siders"" believe the best strategy is through deep tax cuts that they believe will encourage economic growth, which in turn will increase tax revenue enough to compensate. United States. Reagan era. The label ""fiscal conservative"" became an important part of political rhetoric through its promotion by members of the Reagan administration (1981–1989). During Reagan's tenure, marginal income tax rates for the top personal tax bracket dropped from 70% to 28% in 7 years, while payroll taxes increased as well as the effective tax rates on the lower two income quintiles. Real Gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered after the 1982 recession and grew during Reagan's remaining years in office at an annual rate of 3.4% per year. Unemployment peaked at over 10.7% percent in 1982 then dropped during the rest of Reagan's terms, and inflation significantly decreased. Federal tax receipts nearly doubled from $517 billion in 1980 to $1,032 billion in 1990 ($650 billion in 1980 dollars, or a 21% increase), but fell as a percentage of GDP from 19% to 18%. By the end of Reagan's second term the national debt held by the public ballooned from 26 percent of the GDP in 1980 to 41 percent in 1989. By 1988, the debt totaled $2.6 trillion, in part because of increased military spending at the end of the Cold War, but also because of Reagan's tax cuts. The country owed more to foreigners than it was owed, and the United States moved from being the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. Clinton era. While Republicans and libertarians most commonly label themselves as fiscal conservatives, many centrist or moderate Democrats also claim the title, referring to themselves as ""New Democrats"". Former President Bill Clinton, who was a New Democrat and part of the fiscally conservative Third Way advocating Democratic Leadership Council, is a prime example of this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations. The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during the Clinton years, the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002. In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a platform that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the Contract with America, which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a line-item veto, and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans a majority in the House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%. After this combination of tax cuts (but increased revenue) and spending reductions, the United States was able to reduce the $3.8 trillion public debt by $360 billion and create the lowest budget deficit in over 45 years ($17.9 billion in fiscal year 2000) as well as the longest period of sustained economic growth in United States history. However, the claimed ""surplus"" was only recorded against public debt which was calculated with the exclusion of intragovernmental holdings. This meant that the administration was able to record loans deducted from the social security trust fund as revenue on budget reports, which accounted for the bulk of the surplus money. Calculating both the intragovernmental holdings from the public debt, the lowest deficit was $17.9 billion; in effect, the alleged surplus was a mere accounting fiction The total national debt (gross federal debt) rose every year of the Clinton Administration from $4.3 trillion to $5.6 trillion and from $5.4 trillion to $5.6 trillion over the years where the surplus was claimed. American businessman, politician, and current Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, considers himself a fiscal conservative and expressed his definition of the term at the 2007 United Kingdom Conservative Party Conference. United Kingdom. Fiscal conservatism in the UK was arguably most popular during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who, after a number of years of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. However, despite being elected in 1979, Britain's budget was not balanced until 1988. In 2010, as a result of the deterioration in the UK's public finances caused by the Late-2000s recession and by the European sovereign debt crisis, the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition embarked on an austerity programme – featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises – in an attempt to half the deficit, and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the five-year parliament. Australia. Howard Government. Fiscal conservatism become popular during the Howard government where large importance was placed on first balancing the budget and then running consistent surpluses to pay down the debt that had been taken on by Keating Government in response to the early 1990s recession. In first term of government Howard made large cuts to government expenditure by laying off employees, and reducing social spending. Throughout his term of office Howard used the surplus budgets that he achieved to contrast his economic management to that of the Australian Labor Party. By 2006, the Howard government paid off the debt held by the Australian national government. "
wikipedia-4032542," AT&T U-verse  AT&T U-verse (or simply U-verse) is an AT&T brand of triple-play telecommunications services in 22 of the United States. Launched on June 26, 2006, U-verse includes broadband Internet, IP telephone, and IPTV services. History. SBC Communications (now AT&T Inc.) announced its plans for a fiber-optic network and IPTV deployment in 2004 and unveiled the name ""U-verse"" for the suite of network services on January 6, 2008. Beta testing began in San Antonio, in 2005, and AT&T U-verse was commercially launched June 26, 2006 in San Antonio. Later in 2009 the product launched in San Francisco, Hartford, Indianapolis, and other cities in their vicinity. On January 25, 2010, AT&T announced that U-verse was available to over 2.8 million households. Later that year, U-verse was launched in Milwaukee, Dallas, Kansas City, Detroit, Los Angeles, Cleveland, San Diego, and Oklahoma City. U-verse Voice was added on January 22, 2008, and was first available in Detroit. In 2008, U-verse availability approached 8 million households, and over 225,000 customers had been enrolled, with new installations reaching 12,000 per week. By 2009, 1 million U-verse Voice customers and 2.1 million U-verse TV customers had been enrolled. At the end of 2011, U-verse was available to more than 30 million living units in 22 states, and U-verse TV had 3.8 million customers. By mid-2012, U-verse TV had 4.1 million customers, U-verse Voice 2.6 million, and U-Verse High Speed Internet 6.5 million. By the third quarter of 2012, U-verse had 4.3 million TV subscribers, 2.7 million Voice subscribers and 7.1 million High Speed Internet. This represents 7% growth quarter on quarter. The actual number of customers is lower, as most customers are subscribed to a bundle (such as TV and voice) and so are counted in both categories In the third quarter of 2012, AT&T President John Stankey announced that U-Verse deployment was 'virtually over'. On November 7, 2012, AT&T announced plans to do the following: Services. U-verse uses a fiber-to-the-node (FTTN) or fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) communications network, which uses fiber-optic connections to boxes either within a neighborhood or at each home's network interface device. High-speed digital subscriber lines with ADSL2+ or VDSL technology connect from FTTN nodes to the customers' premises. In order to qualify for the VDSL service the premises needs to be within about 3000–3500 feet of the VRAD. This distance can be extended to about 4500–5500 feet with the use of two-pair bonding. Television. U-verse TV is delivered via IPTV from the headend to the consumer's receiver, required for each TV. Transmissions use digital H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) encoding, compared to the existing deployments of MPEG-2 codec and the discontinued analog cable TV system. The receiver box does not have a RF tuner, but is an IP multicast client which requests the channel or ""stream"" desired. U-Verse TV supports up to 4 active streams at once. The system uses individual unicasts for video on demand, central time shifting, start-over services and other programs. U-verse packages. AT&T groups its general channels into progressive packages (U-family, U200, U300, and U450); each adds channels to the package before it, with rare exceptions. All subscribers receive at least the equivalent of the U-family package, which also includes 41 of the 46 Music Choice channels. Many U-family channels were also available on the historical U-basic package. The historical U400 package is identical to the U450 package except that U450 automatically includes the HD Services package. Specialty channels are grouped into A la Carte packages, which can be combined with the general packages: The Sports Package; ESPN FULL COURT and ESPN GamePlan; Fox Soccer ""Plus"" HD; NBA League Pass; HD Services; HD Premium Tier; Paquete Español; and Adult. Paquete Español can be combined with a higher-tier package and is then called U200 Latino, U300 Latino, or U450 Latino. Additionally, channels grouped as Internationals are available A la Carte in language groups or singly, and a number of premium movie packages are available to premium package or higher-tier subscribers. High-definition TV technology is required to access HD channels. Internet. Internet is provided to computers connected to the on-premises Ethernet cabling or wi-fi from the included residential gateway or DSL modem. The Power service was announced August 26, 2013. The power service requires two conditioned line pairs (pair bond) and the Motorola NVG589 VDSL2+ Gateway. There is a $99 service charge to condition and pair bond the lines and install the new gateway. Because of the Motorola NVG589, true bridge mode support is available for the first time with U-verse (last available with ADSL with speeds of less than 6Mbit/s), which allows for customers to use their own routers to full potential for services such as VPN (ipsec, L2TP, and SSL)and dynamic DNS. In Bridge mode, the Gateway acts as a pass-through device and allows the workstations on your LAN to have public addresses directly on the Internet. For the first year, Power initially costs $10 more than Max Turbo, plus the standard u-verse rate of $10 more for every 50GB used over 250GB in a billing month. The Max Plus service (then ""Max 18"") was announced in November 2008, and Max Turbo was announced in December 2009. Basic, Express, Pro, Elite and Max (VDSL) are usually available for self-installation. Max (ADSL2+), Max Plus, and Max Turbo can be self-installed if only one jack is connected for DSL (through a splitter installed by a technician), or splitter-free if no landline is sharing the pair. Conditions where the higher speeds are still attainable through use of filters or quality wiring to more than one jack occur much less often. Voice. AT&T U-verse Voice is a voice communication service delivered over AT&T's IP network (VoIP). This phone service is digital and has a voicemail service found by dialing *98 from the home number. Customers subscribing to both U-verse TV and U-verse Voice are provided features such as call history on channel 9900, which displays the last 100 missed and answered calls on the customer's TV, and ""Click to Call"" from the TV history. U-verse Voice includes Caller ID, Call Blocking, Anonymous Call Blocker, and many other calling features. U-Verse Voice was first available in Detroit, on January 22, 2008. Equipment. Line equipment. U-verse uses the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 or 7340 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf, also called a video-ready access device (VRAD), deployed either in a central office (CO) or to a neighborhood serving area interface (SAI). These models are both composed of circuit boards providing service, which are fed by fiber. FTTN (fiber to the node) systems use model 7330, which uses existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an internet protocol DSL access multiplexer that supports VDSL and ADSL protocols. FTTP (fiber to the premises) systems use model 7340, which is mostly used in areas such as new neighborhoods or large-scale developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a serving area interface, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. The fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the network interface device. The VRAD typically connects upstream to an Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet service switch in the central office hub, then to the headend video hub office. Customer equipment. The customer premise equipment is provided by AT&T (leased for a monthly fee or purchased with a 1-year warranty), and includes a wireless router and modem, referred to as a residential gateway or internet gateway, as well as TV receivers made by Cisco and Motorola (including standard receivers, wireless receivers, and DVR receivers). Gateway models frequently used include the 2Wire 3800, the 2Wire 3801, and the 2Wire iNID (including the 2Wire 3812 outside unit). The only VDSL gateway used is the 2Wire 3600. ADSL2+ installations are with Motorola's NVG510 internet gateway and, in the optional case for business customers, the Motorola 2210 or 2310 modem. There had been wide use of 2Wire's 2701 ADSL2+ gateway, but it was replaced by the NVG510, as the latter supported packet transfer mode (PTM), could be set on speeds higher than 6Mbit/s downstream (Elite), and was a Wireless N (2.4 GHz) wi-fi router. The EdgeMarc 250AEW (business) and Cisco E1000 and E1200 (residential) were tethered router solutions that were also replaced by the emergence of the NVG510. In 2013, the Motorola NVG589 was brought into service to support the Power Internet level of 45Mbit/s, voice (VOIP) on models with phone jack(s), wireless B, G, and N (130Mbit/s maximum, 2.4 GHz), and cable TV (HPNA). There is an optional battery. It has VPN passthrough and NAT Forwarding. The NVG589 also offers Bridge mode thus providing internet public IP address(es) to other routers or other devices, which should make it attractive to business, home-office and sophisticated users. There are limited reports that it helps to cleanup line problems at speed lower than 45Mbit/s. "
wikipedia-4032585," Sigma receptor  The sigma receptors σ1 and σ2 bind to ligands such as 4-PPBP, SA 4503, ditolylguanidine, dimethyltryptamine and siramesine. Classification. σ–receptors were once thought to be a type of opioid receptor, because the d- stereoisomers of the benzomorphan class of opioid drugs reduced coughing, as do some other opioid derivatives such as dextromethorphan. However, such drugs had no effects at μ (Mu), κ (kappa), or δ (Delta) receptors. However, pharmacological testing indicated that the σ-receptors ""were"" activated by drugs completely unrelated to the opioids, and their function was unrelated to the function of the opioid receptors. For example, phencyclidine (PCP), and the antipsychotic haloperidol may interact with σ-receptors. Neither phencyclidine nor haloperidol have any appreciable chemical similarity to the opioids. When the σ1 receptor was isolated and cloned, it was found to have no structural similarity to the opioid receptors. At this point, they were designated as a separate class of receptors. Function. The function of these receptors is poorly understood though an endogenous ligand, dimethyltryptamine, was found to interact with σ1. Activation of σ–receptors by an agonist ligand may induce hallucinogenic effects and also may be responsible for the paradoxical convulsions sometimes seen in opiate overdose. Drugs known to be σ–agonists include cocaine, morphine/diacetylmorphine, opipramol, PCP, fluvoxamine, methamphetamine, dextromethorphan, and the herbal antidepressant berberine. However the exact role of σ–receptors is difficult to establish as many σ–agonists also bind to other targets such as the κ-opioid receptor and the NMDA receptor. In animal experiments, σ–antagonists such as rimcazole were able to block convulsions from cocaine overdose. σ–antagonists are also under investigation for use as antipsychotic medications. Physiologic effects. Physiologic effects when the σ–receptor is activated include hypertonia, tachycardia, tachypnea, antitussive effects, and mydriasis. Some σ–receptor agonists—such as cocaine, a weak σ–agonist—exert convulsant effects in animals. Behavioral reactions to σ–agonists are rather heterogeneous: some individuals find σ–receptor agonists euphoric with significant anti-depressive effects. Other individuals, however, experience dysphoria and often report feelings of malaise or anxiety. Recently selective σ–receptor agonists were shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in mice. "
wikipedia-4032622," Materialized view  A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary based on aggregations of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables, are also known as snapshots. A snapshot can be redefined as a materialized view. Introduction. In any database management system following the relational model, a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever a query or an update addresses an ordinary view's virtual table, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying base tables. A materialized view takes a different approach in which the query result is cached as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.  In addition, because the materialized view is manifested as a real table, anything that can be done to a real table can be done to it, most importantly building indexes on any column, enabling drastic speedups in query time. In a normal view, it's typically only possible to exploit indexes on columns that come directly from (or have a mapping to) indexed columns in the base tables; often this functionality is not offered at all. Materialized views were implemented first by the Oracle Database: the Query rewrite feature was added from version 8i. They are also supported in Sybase SQL Anywhere. In IBM DB2, they are called ""materialized query tables""; Microsoft SQL Server has a similar feature called ""indexed views"". MySQL doesn't support materialized views natively, but workarounds can be implemented by using triggers or stored procedures or by using the open-source application Flexviews. It is also possible to implement materialized views in PostgreSQL; version 9.3 natively supports materialized views.

wikipedia-4032654," Gourd Dance  The Gourd Dance is a type of Native American celebration dance and ceremony. It is believed that the dance originated with the Kiowa tribe. Gourd dances are often held to coincide with a pow-wow, although the Gourd Dance has its own unique dance and history. Gourd Dancing may precede the pow-wow or it can be a separate event, not directly connected with a pow-wow. Origin legends. A Kiowa story recounts the tale of a young man who had been separated from the rest of the tribe. Hungry and dehydrated after many days of travel, the young man approached a hill and heard an unusual kind of singing coming from the other side. There he saw a red wolf singing and dancing on its hind legs. The man listened to the songs all afternoon and through the night and when morning came, the wolf spoke to him and told him to take the dance and songs back to the Kiowa people. The ""howl"" at the end of each gourd dance song is a tribute to the red wolf. The Kiowa Gourd Dance was once part of the Kiowa Sun Dance ceremony. Other tribes including the Comanche and Cheyenne also have stories about the gourd dance. The Cheyenne believe that the Cheyenne tribe is the source of the gourd dance tradition and have elaborate oral tradition accounting for it. The ambiguity of origins of the dance may be because the gourd is simply a rattle. There are many types of rattles used by many different American Indian tribes, on many different occasions. It is possible that the ""gourd"" rattle designates a particular social organization of the dance, rather than simply the kind of rattle used. The modern gourd dance does indicate Kiowa influence pertaining both to the social etiquette and especially the songs. In the Southern Plains the gourd dance is dominated by Kiowa presence. Decline, revival, and organizations within the Kiowa Tribe. Beginning in 1890 the United States government began to actively enforce bans on Kiowa cultural ceremonials and the Gourd Dance was out of normal practice by the late 1930s.  In 1957 the Kiowa Director for the American Indian Exposition, Fred Tsoodle, called upon singers Bill Koomsa and William Tanedooah who remembered the Gourd Dance songs. Also called were Clyde Ahtape, Harry Hall Zotigh, Fred Botone, Oliver Tanedooah, and Abel Big Bow in Kiowa Gourd Dance dress to dance to the songs for a special tribal presentation at that year's festivities. Two years later inspired by the presentation several Kiowa men reorganized the Kiowa Gourd Dance Society and formally established the organization on January 30, 1957 and voted on the name ""Kiowa Gourd Dance"". Within the next decade the organization split into three unrelated branches: the establishing group (now called Kiowa Gourd Clan), Tiah-Piah Society of Oklahoma (established in 1962), and the Tia-piah Society of Carnegie (now known as the Kiowa TiaPiah Society). All three societies hold their annual ceremonials on and around July 4, due to the Gourd Dance at one time being a part of the Sun Dance ceremonials usually held in mid-summer.  The variations on the word ""Tia-Piah"" used in the names of Kiowa Gourd Dance organizations comes from Jài:fè:gàu (Tdeinpei-gah), one of the eight Kiowa warrior societies. Perhaps because of the military connotations of the term the Gourd Dance has often been mistaken for a ""veteran's dance"". However, leaders of all three of the earliest Kiowa-established gourd dance organizations agree that this is not a requirement to become a member of the societies. Dances from two of the other presently-existing societies, Pòlá:hyòp (""Pah-Lye-Up"" or ""Rabbit Society"") and Óhòmà:gàu (""Ohomah"" or ""War Dance Society""), are incorporated into the Kiowa summer ceremonials before and after the gourd dance sessions. Participation. The Gourd Dance originated with the Kiowa tribe, and is a man's dance. Women participate by dancing in place behind their male counterparts and outside the perimeter formed by the men. The dance in the Kiowa Language is called ""Ti-ah pi-ah"" which means ""ready to go, ready to die"".  The Kiowa consider this dance as their dance since it was given to them by ""Red Wolf"". It has spread to many other tribes and societies, most of which do not have the blessing of the Kiowa Elders. Some gourd societies do not distinguish race as a criterion, and even non-Indians can and are inducted into their gourd societies, the Kiowa gourd dance society however only inducts Indians of half blood or more. Many participants may be older men, and the dance is less energetic and less physically demanding than most pow-wow dances. Some of the Gourd Dances that are held go on all afternoon and on into the evening when it finally cools off enough so that more energetic Intertribal dances can begin. Some Tribal dances feature only Gourd Dancing. Dress. The gourd or rattle, which is traditionally made from a gourd or a large aluminum can. The gourd rattle can have peyote stitch beadwork on the handle. The gourd sash is tied around the waist. Either a gourd blanket or a vest may be worn over the shoulders. The vest or blanket has two colors: red and blue, with the blue being worn over the right shoulder and the red being worn over the left to symbolize the heart. Music and choreography. Like pow-wow dancing, Gourd Dancing is performed in a circular arena. The drum can be placed on the side or in the center of the arena. The dancers take their place around the perimeter of the area. During most of the song, the dancers dance in place, lifting their feet in time to the drumbeats, and shaking their rattles from side to side. At certain points in the singing, the drum beat changes to harder beats. At this point, the dancers will dance in place. when it changes to softer beats the dancers will dance a short distance from their spots.  Typically, the dance begins in the afternoon, and the opening song (referred to as a ""Calling Song"") is sung first. The head singer will determine how many songs are sung in a set. Usually the slower paced songs are sung in the beginning and progressively faster songs are sung as the gourd dance progresses. When the gourd dance draws to a close, a fast song known as the ""Charlie Brown song"" is usually the last to be performed, but it is not the ""official"" closing song. Sometimes buffalo songs will be sung after Charlie Brown. "
wikipedia-4032677," Florida panther  The Florida panther is an endangered subspecies of cougar (""Puma concolor"") that lives in forests and swamps of southern Florida in the United States. Its current taxonomic status (""Puma concolor coryi"" or ""Puma concolor couguar"") is unresolved, but recent genetic research alone does not alter the legal conservation status. This species is also known as the cougar, mountain lion, puma, and catamount; but in the southeastern United States and particularly Florida, it is exclusively known as the panther. Males can weigh up to and live within a range that includes the Big Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. This population, the only unequivocal cougar representative in the eastern United States, currently occupies 5% of its historic range. In the 1970s, there were an estimated 20 Florida panthers in the wild, and their numbers have increased to an estimated 100 to 160 as of 2011. In 1982, the Florida panther was chosen as the Florida state animal. Description. Florida Panthers are spotted at birth and typically have blue eyes. As the panther grows the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan while the eyes typically take on a yellow hue. The panther's underbelly is a creamy white, with black tips on the tail and ears. Florida panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and purrs. Florida panthers are mid-sized for the species, being smaller than cougars from Northern and Southern climes but larger than cougars from the neotropics. Adult female Florida panthers weigh whereas the larger males weigh . Total length is from and shoulder height is . Taxonomic status. The Florida panther has long been considered a unique subspecies of cougar, under the trinomial ""Puma concolor coryi"" (""Felis concolor coryi"" in older listings), one of thirty-two subspecies once recognized. The Florida panther has been protected from legal hunting since 1958, and in 1967 it was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; it was added to the state's endangered species list in 1973.  A genetic study of cougar mitochondrial DNA has reported that many of the supposed subspecies are too similar to be recognized as distinct, suggesting a reclassification of the Florida panther and numerous other subspecies into a single North American cougar (""Puma concolor couguar""). Following the research, the canonical ""Mammal Species of the World"" (3rd edition) ceased to recognize the Florida panther as a unique subspecies, collapsing it and others into the North American cougar. Despite these findings it is still listed as subspecies ""Puma concolor coryi"" in research works, including those directly concerned with its conservation. Responding to the research that suggested removing its subspecies status, the Florida Panther Recovery Team noted in 2007 ""the degree to which the scientific community has accepted the results of Culver et al. and the proposed change in taxonomy is not resolved at this time."" Diet. The Florida panther's diet consists of small animals like hares, mice, and waterfowl but also larger animals like storks, white-tailed deer, and wild boar. Threats. The Florida panther has a natural predator, the alligator. Humans also threaten it through poaching and wildlife control measures. Besides predation, the biggest threat to their survival is human encroachment. Historical persecution reduced this wide-ranging, large carnivore to a small area of south Florida. This created a tiny isolated population that became inbred (revealed by kinked tails, heart, and sperm problems). The two highest causes of mortality for individual Florida panthers are automobile collisions and territorial aggression between panthers. When these incidents don't kill and only injure the panthers, federal and Florida wildlife officials take them to White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida for recovery and rehabilitation until they are well enough to be reintroduced. Additionally, White Oak raises orphaned cubs and has done so for 12 individuals. Most recently, an orphaned brother and sister were brought to the center at 5 months old in 2011 after their mother was found dead in Collier County, Florida. After being raised, the male and female were released in early 2013 to the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area and Collier County, respectively. Primary threats to the population as a whole include habitat loss, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation. Southern Florida is a fast-developing area and certain developments such as Ave Maria near Naples, are controversial for their location in prime panther habitat. Development and the Caloosahatchee River are major barriers to natural population expansion. While young males wander over extremely large areas in search of an available territory, females occupy home ranges close to their mothers. For this reason, cougars/panthers are poor colonizers and expand their range slowly despite occurrences of males far away from the core population. Conservation status. It was formerly considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN, but it has not been listed since 2008. Recovery efforts are currently underway in Florida to conserve the state's remaining population of native panthers. This is a difficult task, as the panther requires contiguous areas of habitat — each breeding unit, consisting of one male and two to five females, requires about of habitat. A population of 240 panthers would require 8,000 to of habitat and sufficient genetic diversity in order to avoid inbreeding as a result of small population size. The introduction of eight female cougars from a closely related Texas population has apparently been successful in mitigating inbreeding problems. One objective to panther recovery is establishing two additional populations within historic range, a goal that has been politically difficult. Management controversy. The Florida panther has been at the center of a controversy over the science used to manage the species. There has been very strong disagreement between scientists about the location and nature of critical habitat. This in turn is linked to a dispute over management which involves property developers and environmental organizations. Recovery agencies appointed a panel of four experts, the Florida Panther Scientific Review Team (SRT), to evaluate the soundness of the body of work used to guide panther recovery. The SRT identified serious problems in panther literature, including mis-citations and misrepresentation of data to support unsound conclusions. A Data Quality Act (DQA) complaint brought by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and Andrew Eller, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), was successful in demonstrating that agencies continued to use incorrect data after it had been clearly identified as such. As a result of the DQA ruling, USFWS admitted errors in the science the agency was using and subsequently reinstated Eller, who had been fired by USFWS after filing the DQA complaint. In two white papers, environmental groups contended that habitat development was permitted that should not have been, and documented the link between incorrect data and financial conflicts of interest.In January 2006, USFWS released a new Draft Florida Panther Recovery Plan for public review.

wikipedia-4032706," Bonda people  The Bonda (also known as the Bondo, Bondo Poraja, Bhonda, or Remo) are an ancient tribe of people numbering approximately 12,000 (2011 census) who live in the isolated hill regions of the Malkangiri district of southwestern Odisha, India, near the junction of the three states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh. Remo, the Bonda language. The Bonda are a scheduled tribe of India and are also known as the Remo (meaning ""people"" in the Bonda language). The tribe is one of the oldest and most primitive in mainland India; their culture has changed little for more than a thousand years. They are one of the 75 Primitive Tribal Groups identified by the Government of India. Their isolation and known aggressiveness continue to preserve their culture despite the pressures of an expanding Indian population. Their language belongs to the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic language family. Bonda attire. The Bonda are generally semi-clothed, the women wear thick silver neck bands. The Bonda attire is explained in a legend relating to the Ramayana. According to it, some Bonda women chanced upon Sita who was bathing at a pond in the Bonda hills and, seeing her naked, they sniggered. Enraged, Sita cursed them to a life where they would be condemned to remaining naked and having their heads shaven. When the Bonda women pleaded forgiveness, Sita gave them a piece of cloth she tore off her sari. This explains, according to the legend, why Bonda women have shorn heads and wear only a ""ringa"", a length of cloth that covers the waist. Their torsos are covered in strings of colourful beads. Bonda women also wear metal rings that cover their necks and bangles on their arms. Since Bonda women hunt and forage for food in the forest, it is thought that these ornaments have a function of protecting them from injuries and attacks by wild animals. Gender roles among the Bonda. In Bonda society, the women enjoy a privileged position. They are the primary workers and providers of food for the community. This matriarchal dominance is also seen in the marital norms of the community. Bonda girls largely marry boys who are at least  five to ten years younger than them. Thus the girl looks after her husband as he grows up and in turn he cares for his elder wife. In contrast with many other populations in India, the number of women among the Bonda greatly exceeds the number of men. Among the men alcoholism is a major issue. They spend much time brewing and consuming liquor from rice, palm and the mahua flower. The Bondas are trained in using arms at a young age. This, coupled with rampant alcoholism and their reputation for a quick temper, has contributed to high rates of fratricide among them. The best way to see members of the tribe is to go to one of the local town markets. It is not safe to go into their tribal areas. The Bondas still use ""binnimoy protha"", or barter, and they customarily go to a market every Sunday. They like to put castor oil on their heads. The women make ""worli paintings"" in their homes. Threats to Bonda culture. The Government of Orissa has over the years tried to bring the Bonda into the mainstream and set up the Bonda Development Agency (BDA) in 1977 with this aim. The Bonda have begun to take up non traditional occupations as migrant labourers and as peons and clerks in government offices. This process of mainstreaming has however also had its fallout. The Remo language is now an endangered tongue as more Bondas have taken to Oriya or Oriya pidgin as their primary language of communication. The absence of a script or text for Remo adds to the threat of its extinction. It is also feared that other indigenous knowledge of the Bondas will also become casualty to this emphasis on integrating them with Oriya society. "
wikipedia-4032737," Fumarase  Fumarase (or fumarate hydratase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate. Fumarase comes in two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic. The mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the Krebs Cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle or the Citric Acid Cycle), and the cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate. Subcellular localization is established by the presence of a signal sequence on the amino terminus in the mitochondrial form, while subcellular localization in the cytosolic form is established by the absence of the signal sequence found in the mitochondrial variety.  This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: citric acid cycle, reductive citric acid cycle (CO2 fixation), and in renal cell carcinoma. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of leiofibromyomas in the skin and uterus in combination with renal cell carcinoma.  Nomenclature. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate hydro-lyase (fumarate-forming). Other names in common use include: Mechanism. Figure 2 depicts the fumarase reaction mechanism. Two acid-base groups catalyze proton transfer, and the ionization state of these groups is in part defined by two forms of the enzyme E1 and E2. In E1, the groups exist in an internally neutralized A-H/B: state, while in E2, they occur in a zwitterionic A-/BH+ state. E1 binds fumarate and facilitates its tansformation into malate, and E2 binds malate and facilitates its transformation into fumarate. The two forms must undergo isomerization with each catalytic turnover. Despite its biological significance, the reaction mechanism of fumarase is not completely understood. The reaction itself can be monitored in either direction; however, it is the formation of fumarate from S-malate in particular that is less understood due to the high pKa value of the HR (Fig. 1) atom that is removed without the aid of any cofactors or coenzymes. However, the reaction from fumarate to L-malate is better understood, and involves a stereospecific hydration of fumarate to produce S-malate by trans-addition of a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen atom through a trans 1,4 addition of a hydroxyl group. Early research into this reaction suggested that the formation of fumarate from S-malate involved dehydration of malate to a carbocationic intermediate, which then loses the alpha proton to form fumarate. This led to the conclusion that in the formation of S-Malate from fumarate E1 elimination, protonation of fumarate to the carbocation was followed by the additional of a hydroxyl group from H2O. However, more recent trials have provided evidence that the mechanism actually takes place through an acid-base catalyzed elimination by means of a carbanionic intermediate E1CB elimination (Figure 2). Biochemical pathway. The function of fumarase in the citric acid cycle is to facilitate a transition step in the production of energy in the form of NADH. In the cytosol the enzyme functions to metabolize fumarate, which is a byproduct of the urea cycle as well as amino acid catabolism. Studies have revealed that the active site is composed of amino acid residues from three of the four subunits within the tetrameric enzyme.  The primary binding site on fumarase is known as catalytic site A. Studies have revealed that catalytic site A is composed of amino acid residues from three of the four subunits within the tetrameric enzyme. Two potential acid-base catalytic residues in the reaction include His 188 and Lys 324. Subtypes. There are two classes of fumarases. Classifications depend on the arrangement of their relative subunit, their metal requirement, and their thermal stability. These include class I and class II. Class I fumarases are able to change state or become inactive when subjected to heat or radiation, are sensitive to superoxide anion, are Iron II (Fe2+) dependent, and are dimeric proteins consisting of around 120 kD. Class II fumarases, found in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes, are tetrameric enzymes of 200,000 D that contain three distinct segments of significantly homologous amino acids. They are also iron-independent and thermal-stable. Prokaryotes are known to have three different forms of fumarase: Fumarase A, Fumarase B, and Fumarase C. Fumarase C is a part of the class II fumarases, whereas Fumarase A and Fumarase B from ""Escherichia coli"" (""E. coli"") are classified as class I. Clinical significance. Fumarase deficiency is characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities. In the newborn period, findings include severe neurologic abnormalities, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and hypotonia. Fumarase deficiency is suspected in infants with multiple severe neurologic abnormalities in the absence of an acute metabolic crisis. Inactivity of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of fumarase are potential causes. Isolated, increased concentration of fumaric acid on urine organic acid analysis is highly suggestive of fumarase deficiency. Molecular genetic testing for fumarase deficiency is currently available. Fumarase is prevalent in both fetal and adult tissues. A large percentage of the enzyme is expressed in the skin, parathyroid, lymph, and colon. Mutations in the production and development of fumarase have led to the discovery of several fumarase-related diseases in humans. These include benign mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and fumarase deficiency. Germinal mutations in fumarase are associated with two distinct conditions. If the enzyme has missense mutation and in-frame deletions from the 3’ end, fumarase deficiency results. If it contains heterozygous 5’ missense mutation and deletions (ranging from one base pair to the whole gene), then leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma/Reed’s syndrome (multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis) could result. Structure. Gene. The FH gene is localized to the chromosomal position 1q42.3-q43. The FH gene contains 10 exons.  Protein. Crystal structures of fumarase C from ""Escherichia coli"" have been observed to have two occupied dicarboxylate binding sites. These are known as the active site and the B site. The active site and B site are both identified as having areas unoccupied by a bound ligand. This so-called ‘free’ crystal structure demonstrates conservation of the active-site water. Similar orientation has been discovered in other fumarase C crystal structures. Crystallographic research on the B site of the enzyme has observed that there is a shift on His129. This information suggests that water is a permanent component of the active site. It also suggests that the use of an imidazole-imidazolium conversion controls access to the allosteric B site. "
wikipedia-4032739," Prostitution in South Korea  Prostitution in South Korea is illegal, but according to The Korea Women's Development Institute, the sex trade in Korea was estimated to amount to 14 trillion South Korean won ($13 billion) in 2007, roughly 1.6 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. The number of prostitutes dropped by 18 percent to 269,000 during the same period. The sex trade involved some 94 million transactions in 2007, down from 170 million in 2002. The amount of money traded for prostitution was over 14 trillion won, much less than 24 trillion won in 2002. Despite legal sanctions and police crackdowns, prostitution continues to flourish in S Korea, while sex workers continue to actively resist the state's activities.  History. Premodern era. Before the modernization of Korea, there were no brothels, but a caste of the women for the elite landholding classes performed sexual labor. Modernization eliminated Korean castes system. The first brothels in Korea began to spread after the country first opened its port in 1876 through a diplomatic pact, causing ethnic quarters for Japanese migrants to sprout up in Busan, Wonsan and Incheon. 1960s: U.S. military. From the 1960s and until today U.S. camptown prostitution still exists outside U.S military bases (for example outside Camp Casey and Camp Stanley). This was the result of negotiation between the Korean government and the U.S. military, involving prostitution for United States soldiers in camptowns surrounding the U.S military bases. The government registered the prostitutes who were called as Western princess and required them to carry medical certification. The U.S military police provide for the security in these U.S camptown prostitution sites and detained the prostitutes who were thought to be ill to prevent epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases. This government involvement was in the past motivated in part by fears that the American military which protected South Korea from North Korea would leave. Camptown prostitution exists outside U.S. military bases (for example outside Camp Stanley). Though U.S. officials publicly condemn prostitution, they are perceived as taking little action to prevent it, and some locals suggest that U.S. Army authorities prefer having commercial sex services available to soldiers. 2000s. In 2003, the Korean Institute of Criminology announced that 260,000 women, or 1 of 25 of young Korean women, may be engaged in the sex industry. However, the Korean Feminist Association alleged that from 514,000 to 1.2 million Korean women participate in the prostitution industry. In addition, a similar report by the Institute noted that 20% of men in their 20s pay for sex at least four times a month, with 358,000 visiting prostitutes daily. In 2004, the South Korean government passed an anti-prostitution law (Special Law on Sex Trade 2004) prohibiting the buying and selling of sex and shutting down brothels. In 2006, the Ministry for Gender Equality, in an attempt to address the issue of demand for prostitutes, offered cash to companies whose male employees pledged not to pay for sex after office parties. The people responsible for this policy claimed that they want to put an end to a culture in which men get drunk at parties and go on to buy sex. In 2007 the government announced that sex tourism by Koreans would be made illegal, as well as Korean women going abroad to sell sex. The courts prosecuted 35,000 clients, 2.5 times higher than the number of those who were caught buying sex in 2003. Meanwhile enforcement is weak and corruption problematic; there is little evidence that new legislation has made much difference, the trade simply finding other ways to carry on its business. However more men are being sent to ""John School"" for purchasing sex, while a 2010 investigation suggested that 20% of seniors seek out sex workers. Range of services. Following the enactment of the Special Law in 2004, there was a crackdown on red-light districts; while many of the brothels in those areas were forced to close, the crackdown went as quickly as it came, with the result that prostitution was driven more underground but also became a more competitive business with lower prices and more services. Red light districts in South Korea can compare to those of Amsterdam and Germany. The four main red light districts in South Korea prior to the Special Law are Cheongnyangni 588, Yongsan Station, and Mia-ri in Seoul and Jagalmadang in Daegu. While not all of them are operating to full capacity, some still exist while being tolerated not only due to the vast amount of money that is involved in the business, but also in an attempt to control the sex industry. Other sexual services include 가택 마사지 (gataek massaji) which is an ""in-call"" massage where the customer would travel or meet at the masseuse's home or quarters, 키스방 (kiss bang) which are rooms where customers pay to french kiss and fondle women, and 출장 마사지 (chuljang massaji) or an ""out-call"" massage where the masseuse travels to the customer's place, love motel, hotel, or another disclosed location. Teen prostitution. At least half of South Korea's 200,000 runaway youths, 60% of whom are female, have worked as underage prostitutes. The young girls, who often run away to escape academic pressure, sell sex over internet chat, and live with ""families"" in ""jjimjilbang"", or bathhouses with fellow prostitutes. According to United Voice for Eradication of Prostitution, these teen prostitutes are sometimes raped, gang raped, or contract syphilis from their activities. Recidivism is common, with over half of the girls counseled by the Voice returning to the sex trade, because of blackmail from former pimps and social ostracism from future husbands and families. Human trafficking. Though as recently as 2001 the government received low marks on the issue, in recent years the government has made significant strides in its enforcement efforts. Human trafficking was outlawed and penalties for prostitution increased; the 2004 ""Act on the Prevention of the Sex Trade and Protection of its Victims"" was passed, toughening penalties for traffickers, ending deportation of victims, and establishing a number of shelters for victims. As of 2005 there were 144 people serving jail time for human trafficking. A US Immigration official conceded in 2006 that ""There's a highly organized logistical network between Korea and the United States with recruiters, brokers, intermediaries. A Los Angeles police spokesman said that about 90 percent of the department’s 70-80 monthly arrests for prostitution involve Korean women and Los Angeles police estimates that there are 8,000 Korean prostitutes working in that city and its suburbs. Korean women`s customers in foreign countries are mostly Korean men. A US State Department report titled, ""Trafficking in person's report: June 2008,"" states that in ""March 2008, a joint operation between the AFP and DIAC broke up a syndicate in Sydney that allegedly trafficked South Korean women to a legal brothel and was earning more than $2.3 million a year. Police allege the syndicate recruited Korean women through deception about the conditions under which they would be employed, organized their entry into Australia under false pretenses, confiscated their travel documents, and forced them to work up to 20 hours a day in a legal Sydney brothel owned by the syndicate."" The US State Department report also states that the South Korean government ""fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking."" In 2012, the government continued law enforcement efforts against sex trafficking, and signed MOUs for the Employment Placement System (EPS) with five additional countries and conducted numerous anti-trafficking awareness campaigns. The Korean National Police Agency also cooperated with foreign law enforcement agencies to crack down on human smuggling networks. Foreign prostitutes in South Korea. South Korea is both a source and destination country for human trafficking. Mainly Chinese and Russian and Southeast Asian women are brought into the country for prostitution by Korean employment agencies, many of whom are tricked into thinking they will have a legitimate job. The agencies use high salaries to lure young girls to go to Korea and once they arrived, they will be forced to work as sex slaves. Chinese prostitutes in South Korea. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese women ( both Han and Korean Chinese) are engaged in the prostitution businesses such as hotel, massage parlor, noraebang room, room salon and so on in Korea Russian prostitutes in South Korea. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, young Russian girls have been commonly seen in the red district of Korea. They can be found in the bars, strip club and coffee shop for entertaining the customers. Between January 2000 and March 2001, approximately 6,000 Russian women entered Korea through Busan port and Gimpo. In 2000, 3,064 Russians entered South Korea on E-6 visas, 2,927 of them women (Jhoty, 2001) "
wikipedia-4032781," Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari  Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari (1318 – 1389) was the founder of what would become one of the largest and most influential Sufi Muslim orders, the Naqshbandi. Biography. Concerning his life much information is lacking. This is not surprising since he forbade his followers to record anything of his deeds or sayings during his lifetime, and writings composed soon after his death, such as the ""Anis at-Talibin"" of Salah ad-Din Muhammad Bukhari (d. 1383), concentrate upon matters of spiritual and moral interest. Early life and education. Baha-ud-Din was born in 1318 in the village of Qasr-i-Hinduvan (later renamed Qasr-i Arifan) near Bukhara, and it was there that he died in 1389. Most of his life was spent in Bukhara Khwarezm and contiguous areas of Transoxiana, in keeping with the principle of ""journeying within the homeland"" (a practise mentioned in ""The Sacred Words""),and in Omar Ali-Shah's: ""The Rules or Secrets of the Naqshbandi Order"", and the only long journeys he undertook were for the performance of hajj on two occasions. He came into early contact with the Khwajagan (lit: the Masters), and was adopted as spiritual progeny by one of them, Baba Muhammad Sammasi, while still an infant. Sammasi was his first guide on the path, and more important was his relationship with Sammasi's principal khalifa (successor), Amir Kulal, the last link in the silsila before Baha-ud-Din. It was Amir Kulal that Baha-ud-Din received his fundamental training on the path and whose company he kept for many years. Still more significant, however, was the instruction Baha-ud-Din received in the method of silent dhikr from the ""ruhaniya"" of Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani (""ruhaniya"" refers to an initiation dispensed by the spiritual being of a departed preceptor). Although he was a spiritual descendant of Abdul Khaliq, Amir Kulal practised vocal dhikr, and after Baha-ud-Din received instruction in silent dhikr, he would absent himself from Amir Kulal's circle of followers whenever they engaged in dhikr of the tongue. This separation of Baha-ud-din from Amir Kulal's circle may be thought of as marking the final crystallization of the Naqshbandiya, with silent dhikr, received from Abdul Khaliq and ultimately inherited from Abu Bakr, established as normative for the order, various later deviations nontwithstanding. Death. Baha-ud-Din died and was buried in his native village in 1389, and the tomb that was erected for him become a principal place of visitation and a major element in the attraction in Bukhara. "
wikipedia-4032790," Hans-Adolf Prützmann  Hans-Adolf Prützmann (31 August 1901, Tolkemit, Province of West Prussia - 21 May 1945, Lüneburg) was a Superior SS and Police Leader, as well as an SS-""Obergruppenführer"". He was a senior Nazi in the administration of Latvia following the German conquest of that country in 1941 and as such was involved to an extent not yet fully determined, in carrying out The Holocaust in the Baltic States. Early life. After completing his studies at the Gymnasium, Prützmann studied agriculture in Göttingen, before he became a member of various ""Freikorps"" between 1918 and 1921. Despite being a member, he nevertheless avoided military and typical ""Freikorps""-related aggressive situations. This, however, changed in 1923, when he interrupted his studies to accompany a ""Freikorps"" involved in the Upper Silesian uprisings. Afterwards he worked for seven years as an agricultural official in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and East Prussia. Nazi career. He joined the SA in 1929. Prützmann had become quite a radical soldier as a result of his ""Freikorps"" experiences. Since his own personal goals did not match the milder thinking found in the SA, he left the organization in 1930 and transferred to the SS; one of his first command assignments was as the ""Führer"" of the 18th SS-Standarte. As of this point in time, Prützmann's career began a steep rise. While a member of the Reichstag, he was appointed SS-""Brigadeführer"" in November 1933, and in February 1934 he was promoted to the rank of SS-""Gruppenführer"". At the same time, Prützmann was appointed Leader of the SS Upper Division Southwest in Stuttgart. From March 1937 until May 1941, Prützmann led the SS Upper Division Northeast whose headquarters were in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad). World War II. By April 1941, Prützmann had been appointed ""Generalleutnant"" (Lieutenant General) of the Police. From June until October 1941, he was ""Höherer S.S. und Polizeiführer"" (Higher SS and Police Leader) of Russia-North, the post being responsible for internal security and combatting partisans. He held the same position in Ukraine and Russia-South until the summer of 1944. He also commanded ""Kampfgruppe"" ""Prützmann"" in Ukraine during the early summer of 1944, and was awarded with the German Cross in Gold for his actions. Role in the Latvia Holocaust. From June to November 1941, Prützmann held the post of Higher SS and Police Leader (""Höherer SS and Polizeiführer"") or HSSPF for Latvia. Effectively this made him ruler or, with, Hinrich Lohse, co-ruler of Latvia. In Latvia killing of Jews and other persons began almost immediately, and at first they were primarily conducted by a mobile killing group (Action Group A (""Einsatzgruppe A"")). In late July 1941, ""Einsatzgruppe A"" moved out of Latvia, and primary responsibility for organizing the murder of Jews then moved to the Latvian office of the SD (""Sicherheitsdienst"", or Security Service.) As HSSPF Latvia, Prützmann was in charge of the SD and the person responsible for implementing the Final Solution in Latvia. After the departure of ""Einsatzgruppe A"", a dispute arose among the Nazi rulers of Latvia about their so-called ""Jewish problem"". One group, headed by Lohse, who was backed by Alfred Rosenberg, wanted to confine the Jews to ghettos, steal all their property, and work them as slave laborers in support of Germany's war effort. Heinrich Himmler, the overall head of the SD, and Prützmann's ultimate boss, wanted the Jews of Latvia murdered right away. Up until November, 1941, the Lohse/Rosenberg faction had somewhat prevailed, and as a result ""only"" about 30,000 of Latvia's approximately 70,000 Jews had been killed by then. Unhappy with pace at which the SD was murdering people in Latvia, Himmler replaced Prützmann in mid-November 1941 with Friedrich Jeckeln, an experienced murderer who in Ukraine had developed his own ""Jeckeln system"" of killing 10,000 or more people in a single day. Prützmann was assigned to Ukraine. Prützmann's precise role as HSSPF Latvia in the murders of Jews and other war crimes in Latvia has never been fully explained. He appears to have been something of a weakling in the struggles the Nazis were having between themselves. It is known that Prützmann was responsible for forcing the Jews of Latvia into ghettos, which allowed them to be later more readily killed by Jeckeln and others. It is also known that when Jeckeln took over as HSSPF Latvia, Prützmann among others reported to him that large numbers of Jews had already been killed. Later career. One of his last promotions came in September 1944 when Prützmann was appointed by Heinrich Himmler as ""Generalinspekteur für Spezialabwehr"" (General Inspector of Special Defense) and assigned the task of setting up the Werwolf force's headquarters in Berlin and organizing and instructing the force. Prützmann had studied the guerrilla tactics used by Russian partisans while stationed in the occupied territories of Ukraine and the idea was to teach these tactics to the members of Operation Werwolf. As originally conceived, the Werwolf units were intended to be legitimate uniformed military formations trained to engage in clandestine operations behind enemy lines in the same manner as Allied Special Forces such as Commandos. In early 1945, under orders from Himmler, he directed the assassination of the Allied-appointed mayor of Aachen, Franz Oppenhoff. Arrest and suicide. Shortly before the war ended, Prützmann was captured by the Allies and became a prisoner of war. While in their custody, he ended his own life. Whether his suicide happened in Lüneburg, or as another account has it, at an interrogation camp at Diest in Belgium is not quite clear, but it seems certain that his date of death was 21 May 1945. "
wikipedia-4032851," Great north faces of the Alps  In mountaineering, the six great north faces of the Alps (also called the six 'classic north faces') are known for their difficulty and great height. They are:  Attaining the first ascent of each of these six faces was a major preoccupation of the best European climbers in the 1930s. Gaston Rébuffat, a Chamonix mountain guide and renowned French alpinist, was the first to climb all six of these north faces. His 1954 work, ""Etoiles et Tempêtes"" (""Starlight and Storm""), chronicles these climbs. Three of these north faces—the Eiger, the Matterhorn and the Grandes Jorasses—are considerably harder to climb than the others. This led to their becoming known as 'the Trilogy'. The first to climb these three faces within a year was the Austrian Leo Schlömmer, from the summer of 1961 to the summer of 1962. Ivano Ghirardini was the first to climb the Trilogy in winter, solo (1977-78), and the first woman was Catherine Destivelle (1992-93-94). With the introduction of the concept of enchainment, the race was on to climb all three faces in one outing, a race eventually won by Christophe Profit who achieved the feat between 11–12 March 1987 in a time of 24 hours.

wikipedia-4032887," CFB Edmonton  CFB Edmonton is a Canadian Forces base located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is also known as Edmonton Garrison or ""Steele Barracks"". History. The history of CFB Edmonton begins at an old airfield called Blatchford Field (named after a former mayor of Edmonton, Kenny Blatchford), a few kilometres south from where CFB Edmonton would eventually be established. The airfield began operating after the First World War and became important to the opening up and development of the Canadian north. During the Second World War Blatchford Field became a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) training station under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. No. 16 Elementary Flying Training School (No. 16 EFTS) and No. 2 Air Observers School (No. 2 AOS) used the aerodrome. The RCAF also ran No. 4 Initial Training School (No. 4 ITS) which was a ground school located at the University of Alberta. No. 16 EFTS closed in 1942 and No. 2 AOS closed in 1944. After No. 2 AOS closed, the station formally became known as RCAF Station Edmonton. Many RCAF squadrons and units were located here, including a survival school and the RCAF Winter Experimental Establishment (WEE). A United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 bomber detachment also used the station. During the war the airfield became a staging point for the US defence of Alaska and was heavily used by the US military. Aircraft had to be ferried and transport aircraft used the aerodrome to support the construction of the Alaska Highway. Air traffic increased significantly and flying activities were becoming hazardous. Since the old airfield could not be expanded because of its proximity to the city of Edmonton, the U.S. Government built a new air facility at Namao, about north of the city. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built two runways at the base, 03/21 and 12/30, both long and Canada's longest. The Americans ran the Namao airfield until the end of the war when the Canadian Government took it over. RCAF Station Edmonton, located at the old Blatchford Field, developed some severe limitations and so all RCAF Squadrons and support units were transferred to the ""new"" RCAF Station Namao on 1 October 1955. Blatchford Field was turned over to the Edmonton municipal government and became a commercial airport. During the Cold War RCAF Station Namao was used by the United States Strategic Air Command, which constructed a ""Nose Dock"" capable of servicing the nose and wings of heavy jet bombers and tankers on the south side of the airfield. The station also hosted the Edmonton Rescue Coordination Centre, and served as home base for United Nations Food Aid flights, delivering much-needed aid to Ethiopia, Somalia, and Bosnia. Because Namao at that time had a runway, 12/30, it was a designated an emergency Space Shuttle landing site by NASA. In 1968, when Canada's armed forces were amalgamated, RCAF Station Namao was redesignated Canadian Forces Base Edmonton (Lancaster Park) and was under command of the new Air Transport Command and later Air Command. Federal Government budget cuts forced the command of the air station to be transferred to the Canadian Forces Land Force Command in 1994. CFB Edmonton (Lancaster Park)/18 Wing Edmonton was redesignated CFB Edmonton. Although both runways are still visible they are no longer in use except for a section of 03/21 used by helicopters. It is one of the few Canadian aerodromes to be given in metres rather than feet. Units. With the formation of air force wings in the 1990s the base became 18 Wing. CFB Edmonton today. CFB Edmonton is currently the headquarters of Land Force Western Area, the highest military authority in western Canada, and a number of brigade groups, including 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the only Regular Force brigade group in the region. The base is situated at Steele Barracks (named for Sir Sam Steele) just outside of the city. The area formerly known as CFB Griesbach within the city itself is no longer operational, all buildings and land were sold and are no longer crown assets. The base as a collective is an important part of the community surrounding Edmonton and is home to some of the most prestigious and experienced units in the Canadian Military. The 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, along with elements of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) and 1 Combat Engineer Regiment (all part of 1 CMBG) were chosen to be a part of Canada's military response to the September 11, 2001 attacks and were deployed on combat operations to Afghanistan (including Operation Anaconda) in 2001 and 2002. Units from the base are currently deployed or in the process of deploying to Kandahar, Afghanistan as part of the Canadian Forces command takeover in that area as well. Units from Edmonton have also been deployed on domestic operations such as to assist with the Red River Flood in 1997 (where the entire 1 CMBG was deployed) and, more recently, as a part of Operation Peregrine in response to the forest fires in British Columbia in 2003. Units from CFB Edmonton have also been deployed on numerous peacekeeping operations, including to Bosnia and Kosovo, among others. The Area Support Unit (ASU) and CFB Edmonton provide infrastructure and support to 47 units located in and around Edmonton. The number of military personnel at these units includes 4,500 regular, and 500 reserve force soldiers. There are also 500 civilian employees and 7,800 family members, bringing the total population of the Edmonton military community to approximately 13,300. In February 2012, it was reported that the Alberta Government had been in contact with the federal government and military officials in Ottawa and Edmonton over the use of the runway for MEDIVAC flights once Edmonton City Centre is closed. Alberta Deputy Premier Doug Horner said that he had spoken with the Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay, and the Minister of Public Works, Rona Ambrose for further discussion. On June 7, 2013, the base hosted the raising of a rainbow flag to kick off Edmonton Pride, the first time in Canadian history that the flag has flown on a military base. "
wikipedia-4032942," American Association for Nude Recreation  The American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) is a nudist organization in the United States. Founded in 1931 as the International Nudist League, the AANR is now an association of approximately 259 U.S. nudist non-landed clubs, resorts and parks. Individuals and families may become members of AANR. While not always required for admitance to an AANR affiliated club, AANR membership entitles the member to a discount, and a basic bona fides. The association promotes nudism and nude recreation in appropriate settings and lobbies various levels of government in the interest of its affiliates and of nudist recreation. Regions. AANR is divided into seven regions with affiliated clubs and business partners to better serve the members. These regions are devoted to promoting family nude recreation in their geographic areas. Note the ""Southwestern Region"" encompasses the area more commonly known as the South Central United States, the Western Region does not include the Pacific Northwest, and Canada is split into three sections, with only Western Canada having its own separate regional division not grouped together with the U.S. History. In 1929, Kurt Barthel organized the first American nudist club, the American League for Physical Culture (ALPC). Henry S. Huntington joined the ALPC in November 1929 and former Dutch Reformed Pastor Ilsley Boone and David Livingston joined in July 1931 after reading the book ""Among the Nudists"". Huntington and Boone were ministers and Livingston, also known as Gilbert (or Gil) Parks, was a businessman. Boone was elected vice president of the ALPC in 1931, but by October 1931 became president.  Also in 1931, the police raided the ALPC gymnasium and those present were charged with public indecency. On December 9, 1931, a New York court dismissed all charges, stating that the exposure was neither public nor indecent.  In late 1931, Huntington, Boone and Livingston created a new organization they named the International Nudist League (INL). Livingston was appointed the first president and editor of the INL publication ""The Nudist"". The first annual meeting of INL was in August 1932 and consisted of three clubs. The name of the International Nudist League was changed, without explanation, to the International Nudist Conference (INC) following that meeting.  The Comstock Law was invoked in 1933 to ban the distribution through the United States Postal Service of ""The Nudist"" as obscene, even with the genitals airbrushed out of the photos. The matter finished up in the United States Supreme Court, where the AANR ultimately won the right to distribute its materials through the mail. After several years, INL changed its name to the American Sunbathing Association (ASA) as Boone, took over the organization. During his behind the scenes controlling tenure, the group grew much larger. ""The Nudist"" was renamed ""Sunshine and Health.""  In 1946, the geographic regions were formed as separate entities. A vote changing the bylaws at the 1951 ASA convention ousted Boone's handpicked leaders and changed voting rules. Following a one year legal battle and judicial oversight, the 1952 convention once again voted to reaffirm the bylaw changes. Boone went off to found another nudist association, albeit a much smaller one. The association grew to more than 50,000 members and in 1995 changed its name again to the American Association for Nude Recreation. Under Boone, AANR was considered a Christian organization (though open to people of all beliefs; something akin to the YMCA). This began to change in the 1960s, as both the AANR and society in general became more secular.  After a 2003 article in the New York Times discussed AANR's Youth Leadership Camps for the children of nudists, Rep. Mark Foley called for an investigation of the camps, claiming concerns of possible child endangerment. An AANR spokesperson, Carolyn Hawkins, stated that the organization is protective of children, whether at the camp or elsewhere and that since the AANR began youth camps in 1992, there have been no reported incidents of pedophilia. AANR currently charters around 259 nudist resorts and campgrounds across the United States. The AANR charter establishes baseline standards, among which is providing for a family-friendly atmosphere. The organization is based in Florida. Awards and associations. The AANR has received awards from the Hospitality Marketing and Sales Association International and the American Society of Association Executives. The AANR belongs to the American Recreation Coalition, the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds, the National Recreation and Park Association, and the Park Law Enforcement Association. In September 2010, the AANR withdrew its association with the International Naturist Federation, accusing the INF of being Eurocentric. Political activity. The AANR has lobbied governments to allow nudism in the United States and Canada. In 2005, they were successful in having nude recreation exempted from anti-nudity laws in West Virginia; Tennessee; California; Dawson County, Georgia; and Lake County, Florida. After hearing about an adult-oriented businesses ordinance in Carroll County, Virginia, an AANR representative in January 2007, faxed to the county attorney a couple suggestions for legal language changes, including a proposed exemption for members of its society. The suggestion read: “No person shall be in violation of this section in or at a club event sanctioned under legal association with the American Association for Nude Recreation,” The association's input was considered but ultimately rejected.

wikipedia-4032992," Republic RC-3 Seabee  The Republic RC-3 Seabee is an all-metal amphibious sports aircraft designed by Percival Spencer and manufactured by the Republic Aircraft Corporation. Design and development. The RC-3 Seabee was designed by Percival Hopkins ""Spence"" Spencer, an aviation pioneer who built his first hang glider in April 1911. At the time, he was 17 years old and constructed it from plans he found in a ""Popular Mechanics"" magazine. On May 15, 1914, Spencer made his first powered flight in a Curtiss flying boat. In 1937, he joined Sikorsky engineer Vincent A. Larsen to design their first, and only, amphibious aircraft, the Spencer-Larsen SL-12C. Development of the plane progressed slowly and in September 1940 Spencer left the partnership to form his own company. His resulting design was the Spencer S-12 Air Car Amphibian. Construction of the S-12 began on March 1, 1941 and the small, two-seat S-12 prototype, registered NX29098, made its first flight on August 8, 1941. The S-12 was a fabric covered amphibian with a unique boxlike forward cabin, a high wing with a two-bladed propeller in pusher configuration and a long, slender tail boom. In December 1941 Spencer put the Air Car into storage and joined the war effort as a test pilot for the Republic Aircraft Corporation. By 1943, he had flight tested 134 of the company's P-47 Thunderbolts.  In April 1943 Spencer left Republic Aircraft to join the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago, Illinois who wanted to use his Air Car to promote their company. Spencer used the company's wood forming equipment to build a new egg-shaped cabin for the Air Car and began demonstrating the aircraft to his former employers, Republic Aircraft. Seeing the potential of the Air Car as the perfect sports plane for pilots returning from the war, Republic purchased the rights to the Air Car in December 1943 and immediately began development of an all-metal version designated the Model RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian. On November 30, 1944 the first RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian, registered NX41816, made its first flight with Spencer at the controls. The aircraft was displayed in St Louis, Missouri in December and by the end of 1944 Republic had received 1,972 civilian orders for the $3,500 airplane. The aircraft was also demonstrated to the U.S. Navy and Army Air Corps. Both services were impressed with the design and on February 19, 1945 the Navy granted Republic Aviation the rights to use the name Seabee for the civilian version. The Army placed a large order for the aircraft, to be used for air-sea rescue operations under the designation OA-15. In September 1945, following VJ Day, both the Army and Navy canceled their orders, which by that time totaled over $20,000,000. The OA-15 Seabee was the last United States Army Air Corps aircraft to use the OA designation, which was dropped when the US Air Force was formed as a separate military branch in 1947. Military operators included the Israeli Air Force, Paraguayan Navy, the United States Army Air Forces, and South Vietnamese Air Force. Production. In order to meet the anticipated postwar demand for civilian light aircraft, Republic endeavored to build the Seabee as inexpensively possible, while still retaining reasonable performance and range. A lot of thought went into eliminating what were at the time termed as 'airplane frills,' resulting in a strong product built with as few parts as possible. For example, Seabees as built did not have ribs in the wings; instead, the heavy corrugated aluminum sheet which formed the skin provided the necessary stiffness. Republic was also willing to buy components in volume, which lowered costs further. On November 22, 1945, the prototype RC-3 (NX87451) came off the assembly line at Republic's factory in Farmingdale, New York, and on December 1 made its first flight in Farmingdale with Spencer at the controls. On December 27, 1945, Republic Aviation purchased Aircooled Motors, manufacturers of the Franklin engine, to supply and build engines for the RC-3 Seabee. In March, 1946, the first production RC-3 Seabee was completed (NC87457, formerly NX87457), and on July 25, 1946 the first Seabee (NC87463, production #13) was delivered at the Republic factory to J.G. (Tex) Rankin of Rankin Aviation Industries of Tulare, California.  In the late 1940s, aircraft manufacturers hoped that military pilots returning from the war would want to continue flying civilian aircraft for pleasure and sport. This never occurred to the extent the companies imagined, as most wartime pilots returned home never to fly again. As a result many small and optimistic aircraft companies appeared, then quickly disappeared in the immediate postwar years.  On October 4, 1947, Republic Aviation Corp. announced that it was discontinuing production of the RC-3 Seabee amphibian for the personal plane market. Republic President Mundy I. Peale stated: ""Due to the need of all Republic's production facilities for the manufacture of other types of airplanes, the company has decided to discontinue production of the Seabee"". Actually, by summer (July/August) 1947 the Seabee sales had almost stalled and since June 1947 the production had been put on hold, awaiting further sales. By the end of production a respectable 1,060 Seabees had been built. Though this was far from the 5,000 Seabees per year Republic had hoped to sell, it still represented a significant number of airplanes compared to other struggling aircraft companies of the same era. Only Piper, with their cheap, long-lived Cub and Super Cub, Beech's popular Bonanza, and Cessna's early 140 and 150 light planes would sell in numbers greater than the Seabee. This was due in no small part to the very low price of the Seabee. During production, however, the price of the Seabee would rise from its original $3,500 to $4,495 effective July 15, 1946, and to $6,000 on November 15, 1946, which was still a remarkable bargain for a four-seat all-metal amphibian aircraft. Republic sold its last new Seabee in 1948. By that time the demand for civilian aircraft had shown itself to be far less than anticipated, and the company turned its attention back to military contracts, developing the successful F-84 Thunderjet, which was built on the same assembly lines formerly used to build the Seabee. Operational history. Seabees became popular in the USA and Canada and were also well-suited for operation in countries with long coastlines, many islands, many lakes and large areas of wilderness. By the time production ended, 108 Seabees had been exported to several countries and dealerships were established in Brazil, Cuba, Panama, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Fiji, New Caledona, South Africa, England, Norway and Sweden. In the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, the Seabee became one of the most popular bush planes and air ambulances in countries like Canada, Norway, Sweden as well as the USA. Many life-saving missions were flown by Seabee pilots rescuing seriously ill people from remote locations, as well as Seabee pilots making ""impossible"" takeoffs and landings from small lakes to deliver supplies to hunters and trappers.  In 2006, over 250 Seabees are still registered and flying, a number that is increasing yearly as new aircraft are assembled from parts and wrecks. A few Seabees are still operating commercially as bush planes and air taxis. In the history of aviation few aircraft have had longer, or more successful, careers than the Seabee. Modifications. 23 Seabees were converted to a two-engine variant known as the United Consultants Twin Bee with the fitting of two wing-mounted engines driving tractor propellers. The added thrust greatly enhanced the plane's speed, acceleration and capacity. Modifications to increase the engine size, wingspan, cargo carrying capacity, controls, trim activation, environmental systems, landing light and many others have been available since the early 1970s. Operators. Civil. The Seabee is popular with air charter companies and small feeder airlines, and is operated by private individuals and companies. "
wikipedia-4033017," Genogram  A genogram (also known as a McGoldrick-Gerson study, a Lapidus Schematic or a Family Diagram) is a pictorial display of a person's family relationships and medical history. It goes beyond a traditional family tree by allowing the user to visualize hereditary patterns and psychological factors that punctuate relationships. It can be used to identify repetitive patterns of behavior and to recognize hereditary tendencies.  Genograms were first developed and popularized in clinical settings by Monica McGoldrick and Randy Gerson through the publication of a book titled ""Genograms: Assessment and Intervention"" in 1985. Genograms are now used by various groups of people in a variety of fields such as medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work, genetic research, education, and many more. Some practitioners in personal and family therapy use genograms for personal records and/ or to explain family dynamics to the client. Few if any genealogists use them. Genogram symbols. A genogram is created with simple symbols representing the gender, with various lines to illustrate family relationships. Some genogram users also put circles around members who live in the same living spaces. Genograms can be prepared by using a complex word processor, or a computer drawing program. There are also computer programs that are custom designed for genograms.  Genogram symbols will usually have the date of birth (and date of death if applicable) above, and the name of the individual underneath. The inside of the symbol will hold the person’s current age or various codes for genetic diseases or user-defined properties: abortions, still-births, SIDS, cohabitations, etc. Genogram content. A genogram can contain a wealth of information on the families represented. It will not only show you the names of people who belong to your family lineage, but how these relatives relate to each other. For example, a genogram will not only tell you that your uncle Paul and his wife Lily have three children, but that their eldest child was sent to boarding school, that their middle child is always in conflict with her mother, that their youngest has juvenile diabetes, that Uncle Paul suffered from depression, was an alcoholic, and a philosopher, while Aunt Lily has not spoken to her brother for years, has breast cancer and has a history of quitting her jobs. Family relationships. One of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as family relationships, emotional relationships and social relationships. Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc. Emotional relationships. Genograms may also include emotional relationships. These provide an in-depth analysis of how individuals relate to one another. Colour-coded lines represent various emotional relationships that bond individuals together. Social relationships. Another component of genograms is social relationships. These allow users to link individuals who are not related to one another, but who have a connection in society-at-large, such as neighbor, co-worker, boss-employee, pastor-church member, teacher-student, etc. Social relationships can also illustrate an individual’s relation to a social entity. The use of social relationships links allows the genogram to be used in a business environment to create organizational charts or floor plan layouts of the employees. A genogram looks like a family tree, but with all the different types of relationships, it contains a significantly more detailed and complete picture of the family or group it illustrates. Purpose of the Genogram. Genealogy. In genealogy, genograms are used to record family history through the lives of each of its members. Genograms allow the genealogist to graphically portray complex family trees that show marriages and divorces, reconstituted families, adoptions, strained relationships, family cohesion, etc. Genealogists can use genograms to discover and analyze interesting facts about their family history, such as a naming pattern, sibling rivalry, or significant events like immigration. Medicine. In medicine, medical genograms provide a quick and useful context in which to evaluate an individual's health risks. Knowledge of diseases and conditions that occur within a family can give a health care team invaluable information that may aid in a swift, accurate diagnosis and treatment of health problems. And, a knowledge of diseases and illnesses that ""run"" in families can give individuals an important head start in pursuing effective preventive measures. A medical genogram is helpful in determining patterns of disease or illness within a family. Medical genograms can include many generations, however four generations may prove to be enough detail. Sociology. In Sociology, genograms are used by Sociologists to gather objective and consistent information from the clients and their family, helping them to view the client’s issues in the larger context of their marital relationship, family relationships and culture of origin and underlining key issues to discuss in client counseling. Genograms portray emotional relationships, which allow Sociologists to see and evaluate possible conflicts within the family. Psychological patterns may be detected in the genogram which provide the basis for precautionary and preventive measures that otherwise might not be warranted. Social work. In social work, genograms are used to display emotional bonds between individuals composing a family or social unit. A genogram will help social workers to make an assessment of the level of cohesiveness within a family or a group and to evaluate if proper care is available within that unit. Genograms also allow displaying social relationships that illustrate the places people attend such as schools, churches, youth facilities, associations or retirement homes. Family Therapy. In family therapy, genograms are used to study and record relationship patterns between family members and the individual characteristics that make up these patterns that occur. A genogram will help family therapists to make an appropriate assessment of the relationship patterns and where intervention may be needed to help the family reduce the dysfunction and/or problematic situation that brought them into therapy. Research. In research, genograms allow researchers to understand multi generational processes within various plant and animal species, such as the development of mutations. Genograms can also illustrate rates of renewal, mechanisms of survival, or processes involved in the regulation of tolerance, among other things. Education. In education, genograms can be used by teachers and students for illustrating book reviews, or family trees of a famous politician, philosopher, scientist, musician, etc. They allow them to focus their attention on specific details and also see the big picture of the books and individuals they are studying. Creating Genograms. Genograms can be useful in almost any profession that deals with social interaction. Genograms can help to visualize complex interactions between individuals and to study patterns of behaviors or diseases. Genograms are easily created with genealogy software, as advanced software allows the user to include tremendous amounts of data. Genealogy software also allows the user to create detailed reports containing analysis of the information stored in each person’s individual properties. Commercial software, such as Genopro, and Genome Analytics is available to produce genograms, as well as hundreds of different academic and scientific programs for specialized uses. Genograms are often drawn by hand, sketched working right with the client. It is also possible to create a Genogram in any graphics or word processing program. "
wikipedia-4033073," Shahid Shiroudi Stadium  The Shahid Shiroudi Stadium () is a sports stadium in Tehran, Iran, currently used only for Athletic competitions. Until 2009 it was used mostly for football matches.  The stadium is able to seat 30,000 people and was opened in 1942. It was called Amjadieh Stadium () until the Iranian Revolution. It was also home to Esteghlal F.C. and Persepolis F.C. before Azadi Stadium was constructed. The stadium was host to the AFC Youth Championship 2000. The stadium was to be the final departing site for Operation Eagle Claw, the aborted mission to rescue 52 American hostages being held in Tehran during the Iran Hostage Crisis. The proposed extraction would have involved a rescue force being transported to the embassy, releasing the hostages, and then escorting the hostages across the main road in front of the embassy to the stadium, where helicopters would have retrieved the entire contingent. Naming. The stadium was named after Shahid Ali Akbar Shiroudi, a Cobra helicopter pilot who was killed in the Iran–Iraq War. "
wikipedia-4033142," Keith Curle  Keith Curle (born 14 November 1963) is an English former professional footballer and manager. As a player he was a defender from 1981 to 2005, notably playing in the Premier League for Manchester City where he was also the club captain. He also played for Bristol Rovers, Torquay United, Bristol City, Reading, Wimbledon, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Sheffield United, Barnsley. He became player-manager of Mansfield Town in 2002, where he remained until 2005, later becoming manager of Chester City, Torquay United and Notts County. Playing career. Born in Bristol, Curle began his career at hometown club Bristol Rovers, for whom he made a goalscoring debut on 29 August 1981 in the (old) Third Division against Chester. He left two seasons later to join Torquay for £5,000 but remained at Plainmoor only for four months before returning to his native city, this time with Bristol City. The ""Robins"" won promotion from the fourth tier at the end of the 1983/84 season soon after Curle's arrival. He remained with the club for three full seasons in the third flight, amassing 128 appearances in total. He finally left Ashton Gate to join Reading for £150,000 in October 1987. After a year at Reading – which saw relegation from the Second Division – he made a £500,000 move to Division One and FA Cup holders Wimbledon. He spent two and a half years battling with the ""Crazy Gang"" before Manchester City paid a club record £2.5million for him in August 1991. This was the joint highest fee paid for a defender by a British club at the time, and one of the highest paid for a player of any position. His first season at Maine Road saw a 5th place league finish and earned him a call-up to the England squad, debuting on 29 April 1992 as a substitute in a 2–2 friendly draw against the CIS in Moscow. After starting in a further warm-up game (a 1–0 win over Hungary), he was selected for the squad for Euro '92. Here, he covered at right-back in their opening goalless group game against Denmark, but played no further part as the nation crashed out at the first stage and was not selected again. Back with his club, Curle was promoted to club captain but they were unable to match their 5th place finish after manager Peter Reid was fired and eventually suffered relegation in the 1995/96 season. Curle remained with the club during pre-season for the following campaign but was soon stripped of his captaincy and transfer-listed before being sold to Wolves in August 1996 for £650,000. He spent four seasons at Molineux as the club tried to win promotion to the Premier League. His first season with the team saw them lose in the play-offs to Crystal Palace, but they failed to qualify for them in his subsequent seasons. He was however made club captain and led to the side to an FA Cup semi-final in 1998, where they lost to eventual double winners Arsenal. The promise of a coaching role saw him move to Sheffield United in 2000 and he spent two years working with manager Neil Warnock in this capacity, scoring once as a player against Bradford City. He joined Barnsley in 2002 but stayed just two months before ending his contract by mutual consent and joining third flight club Mansfield Town, where he was soon appointed player-manager. He played through the remainder of the 2002/03 season before focusing solely on management. Management career. Curle began his management career as player-manager of Mansfield Town in December 2002 after the firing of Stuart Watkiss. He took over with the side struggling in the relegation zone and could not prevent the drop to the fourth tier, but took them to the play-off final in his first full season in charge, where they lost on penalties to Huddersfield.  He was controversially sacked in December 2004 after allegations that he bullied a youth-team player. However, in August 2006, Curle won a case for wrongful dismissal against the club and was awarded undisclosed damages. The judge in the case cleared Curle of any wrongdoing, and described Mansfield's disciplinary process as a ""sham"". Despite the outcome of his hearing not yet being clear, he appointed as manager of Chester City in May 2005 and began brightly with the club challenging for promotion from League Two and eliminating Nottingham Forest from the FA Cup. However, a disastrous losing run of 11 games in 12 cost Curle his job in February 2006 after just nine months in charge. In February 2007, he was appointed ""Head Coach"" (effectively manager under Director of Football Colin Lee, his former manager at Wolves) at Torquay United, where he had played earlier in his career. He was on a short-term contract that ended in the summer of 2007. After failing to save Torquay from relegation, Curle's contract was not renewed and he was replaced by Leroy Rosenior Curle reunited with Neil Warnock, when the latter was appointed manager of Championship side Crystal Palace in October 2007 and immediately brought Curle into his coaching team.

wikipedia-4033172," Hip score  Hip scoring is a procedure used to determine the degree of hip dysplasia in dogs and other animals and reporting the findings in a standard way. The hip score is the sum of the points awarded for each of nine radiographic tures of both hip joints. The British Veterinary Association uses the following criteria to determine hip score: The lower the score, the less the degree of dysplasia present. The minimum (best) score for each hip is zero and the maximum (worst) is 53, giving a range for the total of 0 to 106. Each hip is scored separately under the BVA, so within the UK scores are usually displayed as two numbers separated by a forward slash (e.g. 2/6). The scores are combined to provide a score for international comparison. The following table compares the scores recognised by Orthopaedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (SV). The average hip scores in the year 2005 for popular breeds from Australia are tabulated below: "
wikipedia-4033192," Space dock  A space dock is a (currently fictional) type of 'dry dock' for spaceships or starships, which would most likely be located in a low planetary orbit. However, concept work has been undertaken on real space dock facilities that could be built with current technology. In both real-world as well as fictional use, they provide dedicated facilities to repair or build spacecraft, bypassing the need to lift materials from a gravity well (or allowing these materials to be lifted in smaller, more manageable loads), respectively avoiding the need for an existing spacecraft to make a planetary landing for maintenance. Real world. Space docks, as part of a wider space logistics infrastructure, are considered a relevant part of a true space-faring society. Scientists of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics have proposed that future, near-term LEO space facilities should include ""a large space dock making possible the on-orbit assembly and maintenance of large space facilities, space platforms, and spacecraft"" (see image for design concept). A space dock / hangar could also allow enclosed (and possibly pressurized) maintenance of smaller spacecraft and space planes, though the construction of non-atmospheric spacecraft and other space facilities is envisaged as its main use. The structural strength of such a more advanced hangar would primarily be based on the internal atmospheric pressure that would have to be sustained for shirt-sleeve operations, thus enabling routine servicing and assembly in space. The use for orbital maintenance could be especially critical for damaged atmospheric spacecraft, which are at great risk during reentry into the atmosphere, as was shown during the ""Columbia"" disaster. In the wake of the disaster, NASA has already improvised repairs to shuttles while in flight, a procedure which would be much easier with a dedicated orbital facility. The use of a major space dock as a construction facility would also be required for the construction of an interstellar colonization starship built with current or near-term technology. Future Ares V missions for example could serve to cost-effectively transport construction materials for future spacecraft and space exploration missions, delivering raw materials to a Moon-based space dock positioned as a counterweight to a Moon-based space elevator. Science fiction. Space docks in science fiction play an important role in the construction and maintenance of space vessels. They add a depth of realism to the fictional worlds they appear in and continue the nautical parallels that most space-based science fiction uses. Space docks serve the same purpose as their non-fictional terrestrial dry dock counterparts, being used for construction, repairs, refits and restorations of spacecraft. Some play significant plot roles, others hide in the background in many sci-fi media. Such science fiction settings as ""Star Wars"", ""Babylon 5"", the ""Honorverse"" and the ""Foundation series"" series mention or allude substantially to such facilities. ""Star Trek"". Space docks of varying styles and sizes have made a number of appearances in the ""Star Trek"" science fiction universe. Often they were shown as open, metal framed structures in which a vessel could be docked. The first such drydock was seen in """" with the refit USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) contained within a dry dock before being sent to intercept an alien vessel on course for Earth. A larger facility, known as 'SpaceDock' was seen for the first time in """". These were huge orbital command installations incorporating internal space docks that could be completely enclosed - starships could enter through bay doors to receive supplies or maintenance. A third type of space dock was seen occasionally in """" and following series. This type of dock had a large command pod at the top, with arms underneath that could house a starship. The ""Enterprise-D"" was refitted and repaired in such a dock following in 2367. ""Babylon 5"". Dock facilities were occasionally seen on the ""Babylon 5"" television series and movies. In the ""Babylon 5"" universe, the space docks were structures deployed outside the station when larger ships were in need of repair. The ""Babylon-station"" itself effectively served as a Space dock with internal docking facilities for freighters, personal transport vessels and its own complement of fighter-craft designated to protect the station.  During the events of the movie """", the ""Excalibur"" and the ""Victory"" were shown in the dry dock facilities in which they were constructed. The dock was destroyed by the Drakh following their attack on Earth, which would halt the construction of further Victory class destroyers until the facilities could be rebuilt. "
wikipedia-4033196," Canada at the Winter Olympics  Canada (IOC country code CAN) has competed at every Winter Olympic Games, and has won at least one medal each time. The country's greatest performance was recently at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where Canadian athletes won 26 medals—two more than the 24 they won in the previous Winter Olympics, in Turin, Italy. Also at the 2010 Games, Canada set a new record for most gold medals won by a country in a single Winter Olympics with 14. This passes the previous record of 13 gold medals in one Games set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and matched by Norway in 2002. Canada has hosted the winter games twice, in Calgary in 1988, and in Vancouver in 2010. Canada has also hosted the Summer Olympic Games once, in 1976 in Montreal. Medal tables. Medals by Winter Games. ""Canada also won the gold medal in ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics; this medal is not counted in this table of Winter Olympic Games."" Medals by sport. Canada has never won an Olympic medal in the following current sports: Luge, Nordic combined, and Ski jumping. Biathlon. Canada's only medals in biathlon were won by Myriam Bedard in the Albertville and Lillehammer games. Bobsleigh. Bobsleigh. Canada has won three gold medals in bobsleigh: the surprising victory by Vic Emery's four-man team in Innsbruck (1964), by Pierre Lueders two-man team in Nagano (1998) and by Kaillie Humphries' two-woman team in Vancouver (2010). Skeleton. In the 2006 Turin games Mellisa Hollingsworth-Richards won Canada's first medal in skeleton and later Duff Gibson became the first Canadian to win a gold medal in skeleton in the men's event. At the 2010 Vancouver games, Jon Montgomery won a gold in the men's event. Curling. Curling is one of the most popular sports in Canada, and both the men's and women's teams have won a medal at each of the four Olympics curling has been held at so far.

The women's team in 1998, led by skip Sandra Schmirler, the men's team in 2006, led by skip Brad Gushue, and the men's team in 2010, led by Kevin Martin have won gold medals. Ice hockey. Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. When Canada's best players (from the National Hockey League) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the Czech Republic won gold and the team fell to Finland in the bronze medal game. Canada finally won its first hockey gold in 50 years in Salt Lake City in 2002, sparking national celebrations. The women's team also won gold in 2002, after winning only silver in the first women's Olympic competition in Nagano. The women repeated as champions in 2006. The 2010 games are the first Olympics to take place in an NHL market since the league's players started to compete in the games, as Vancouver is home to the Canucks. Note: Ice hockey was part of the Summer Olympic program for the 1920 games in Antwerp, but is listed here for completeness. Luge. Canada has never won an Olympic medal in luge. Their best finish was fifth in the doubles race at the 2002 games. Skating. Figure skating. Canada has won at least one medal in figure skating in 13 of the 16 post-war Winter Olympic games (since 1948). Canada's gold medalists are Barbara Ann Scott (1948) and the pairs of Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (1960) and Jamie Salé and David Pelletier (2002). Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir celebrated a number of firsts at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics when they won the gold medal for Ice Dancing: their first gold medal at their first Olympics, and the first North Americans as well as the youngest pair to win gold in this event. Other notable Canadian skaters include 1976 Bronze medalist Toller Cranston, as well as Brian Orser and Elvis Stojko, both of whom won silver medals in successive games. Short track speed skating. Canada has benefitted from the addition of short track speed skating to the Olympic program in 1992, winning multiple medals at each games since. Marc Gagnon, who won 3 gold and 2 bronze medals between 1994 and 2002 and François-Louis Tremblay, who has collected 2 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medals from 2002 to 2010, are among only 5 Canadian Olympians to win a total of 5 medals.

wikipedia-4033334," Jagat Narain  Lala Jagat Narain (31 May 1899 − 9 September 1981) was the founder of the Hind Samachar group. Lala Jagat Narain, a Chopra Khatri and Congress Party leader, was born at Wazirabad, Gujranwala District (now in Pakistan) in 1889. He graduated from D.A.V. College, Lahore in 1919, and joined the Law College, Lahore. He left his studies in 1920at the call of Mahatma Gandhi to join the non-cooperation movement. He was sentenced in two and a half years imprisonment, in jail he acted as Lala Lajpat Rai's Personal Secretary. In 1924 he became the editor of Bhai Parmanand's Weekly Hindi Paper Akashvani. He participated in all the Satyagraha movement and was in jail for about nine years on different occasions. His wife was in jail for six months. His eldest son, Ramesh Chandra, was arrested during the Quit India movement. Narain was President of the Lahore City Congress Committee for seven years, leader of the Congress Party in the Lahore Corporation, a member of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee for more than thirty years and member of the All-India Congress Committee for about 30 years. Launch of Punjab Kesari. Narain had come to Jalandhar as a refugee from Lahore and started an Urdu daily, Hind Samachar in 1948. Urdu then was the language of the salaried urban men of Punjab, the people who could afford the time and money for a newspaper. But Urdu in independent India lacked government support. In the schools of Punjab, Punjabi and Hindi became the languages and Gurmukhi and Devanagari the scripts of instruction. In 1965, Jagat Narain founded Punjab Kesari, a Hindi daily. Confrontation with Bhindranwale. Narain, an Arya Samaji, was a prominent critic of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and Congress Party leader. Dilbir Singh, the Public Relations Advisor at Guru Nanak Dev University, claimed that Bhindranwale was responsible for his killing of Jagat Narain. However, no evidence was found against him. H.K. Dua, a former Editor-in-Chief of The Tribune and a close associate of Indian National Congress (I) praised Narain's Hind Samachar Group for standing up against terrorism, pointing out that 62 of his staff were gunned down over a period of time. Assassination and aftermath. The White Paper issued by the government of India, mentioned that Narain was assassinated because of his criticism of Bhindrawale. He was present during the clash that occurred between Nirankaris and Akhand Kirtni Jatha Members, and stood witness at the Karnal Trial against Bhindrawale. Thirteen Sikhs and two Nirankaris were killed in the clash. The Nirankaris fired from their guns on the unarmed and peaceful Akhand Kirtni Jatha Members but were acquitted by court on grounds of self-defence. He was shot dead on September 9, 1981, near Amaltas Motel on the national highway while returning to Jalandhar from Patiala. Both the Government and Surjeet Jalandhari, project the murder as the murder of a person deeply involved in investigating criminal cases in Punjab. In 1981, Bhindranwale barricaded himself inside the fortified Gurudwara Gurdarshan Parkash at Mehta Chowk, but was persuaded to surrender on September 20, 1981. For 25 days, violence exploded all over Punjab, while Bhindranwale was jailed in Circuit House. India’s then Home Minister, Giani Zail Singh, announced to Parliament that there was no evidence that Bhindranwale was involved in Lala Jagat Narain’s assassination, and was released in Oct. 15, 1981.

wikipedia-3995905," 2006 Richmond spree murders  The 2006 Richmond spree murders took place during a 7-day period in January 2006 in Richmond, Virginia, and claimed the lives of 7 people. After the arrest of the perpetrators, Ricky Javon Gray and Ray Joseph Dandridge, two prior murders and an assault were also linked to one or both men. The case received intense media attention due to the brutal and random nature of the crimes, as well as the relative fame of Bryan Harvey, one of the victims. Prelude. On November 5, 2005, the badly beaten body of 35-year-old Treva Terrell Gray was found in a shallow grave by Brookside Avenue in Washington, Pennsylvania by passersby. She had married Gray, a 28-year-old former convict, approximately 6 months before, and lived in a house owned by her family with her husband and Dandridge, his nephew, who had moved in with the couple following his release from prison on October 26, 2005 after serving over 10 years for armed robbery. According to John and Marna Squires, Treva's stepfather and mother, the Grays fought bitterly, and they saw claw marks on Ricky Gray's forearm the day Treva's body was found.  While both Gray and Dandridge were interviewed by the Washington police, they were not considered suspects. Approximately a week after the discovery of their daughter's body, the Squires evicted Dandridge from their property; Dandridge then moved in with his father in west Philadelphia. On December 23, Gray moved out as well to stay with his maternal grandmother in Arlington, Virginia. Dandridge left Philadelphia on Christmas day to join Gray in Virginia. Marna Squires alleges that the police were lax in investigating Treva's death, going so far as to suggest to her that she had died of a drug overdose. While the police ruled her death suspicious at the time, no homicide investigation was launched until after Gray's confession. On December 18, 2005, Sheryl Warner, 37-year-old legal secretary and mother of three, was found shot and hanged by an electrical cord in the basement of her burning house in the town of Reva in Culpeper County, Virginia. She had been on the phone with her father when she stated that a motorist with car trouble was asking to use her phone. Her father contacted the police when she failed to call him back, leading to the discovery of her body. On December 31, 2005, 26-year-old Ryan Carey was attacked by two men he later identified as Gray and Dandridge in front of his parent's home in the 5100 block of North 25th Street in Arlington. Carey sustained extensive beating and stab wounds to the chest, neck and arms in a near-fatal assault, and spent the next two weeks in a coma. He also permanently lost the use of his right arm. Murder spree. The Harvey family. In the early afternoon of January 1, 2006, Kathryn, Bryan, Stella, and Ruby Harvey, a family of four, were found beaten, slashed and bound with electrical cord and tape in the basement of their burning house in the Woodland Heights district of Richmond, Virginia.  Kathryn Harvey, 39, was the co-owner of a popular local toy shop called ""World of Mirth"" in the Carytown district of Richmond, and the half-sister of actor Steven Culp. Bryan Harvey, 49, was an indie musician of note, a former member of House of Freaks, a two-man college rock band in Richmond. Their daughters Stella and Ruby were 9 and 4, respectively. Bryan and Kathryn died of blunt-force trauma to the head, Stella of smoke inhalation and blunt-force trauma to the head, and Ruby of stab wounds to her back, one of which punctured her lung. Chesterfield home invasion. On January 3, 2006, a couple living on Hollywood Drive in Chesterfield County, Virginia, were robbed by two men and a woman who had gained entry to their house by pretending to ask for directions. The robbers stole several items including a computer and a television as well as $800 in cash. The husband was able to dissuade the gang from tying them up by drawing attention to the wife's disability and his need to assist her. The Baskerville-Tucker family. On January 6, 2006, the police received a call from a Chesterfield resident who was concerned about her daughter's friend, a 21-year-old named Ashley Baskerville. The caller suspected that Gray and Dandridge, her former houseguests and former and current boyfriends of Ashley, were involved in the Harvey murders. The police found items at the Chesterfield home linked to the Harvey case, and stormed the house on East Broad Rock Road where Ashley lived with her mother, 46-year-old Mary Baskerville-Tucker, and her stepfather, 55-year-old Percyell Tucker. Percyell worked as a forklift driver and Mary was employed at a dry cleaning establishment. All three members of the Baskerville-Tucker family were found gagged and bound with tape in their ransacked house. Percyell and Mary had also been slashed across the throat. The three had suffocated due to the layers of duct tape wrapped around their heads. Ashley had a plastic bag wrapped around her head as well, secured with duct tape. Arrest and confessions. On the morning of January 7, 2006, Gray and Dandridge were arrested in Philadelphia, where Dandridge's father Ronald Wilson lived. Approximately one hour after the arrest, Dandridge confessed to killing the Tuckers and Ashley Baskerville. Twelve hours after the arrest, Gray asked to speak with a detective, then proceeded to provide a detailed, 3-page confession in which he described using a kitchen knife and claw hammer to kill the Harveys, stating ""I don't believe sorry is strong enough. None of this was necessary."" In subsequent confessions, he admitted to beating his wife Treva to death while Dandridge held her down, to being an accomplice in the Tucker-Baskerville murders, and to the attack on Ryan Carey. On January 8, 2006, the police formally identified Ashley Baskerville as a participant in the Harvey murders, the Chesterfield robbery and the robbery at her own home as a result of the above confessions as well as eyewitness testimony and other evidence. Baskerville had acted as the lookout in the parked car while Gray and Dandridge entered the Harvey home, and was found wearing Bryan Harvey's wedding band. Gray and Dandridge testified that she had posed as a victim and allowed herself to be bound as a part of the plan to rob her mother and stepfather, ""but ""things just went wrong"" and ""(Gray) got tired of the girl, so he decided to kill her and take her parents' car."" The trials. Gray was tried in Virginia while Dandridge was tried in Pennsylvania. On February 9, 2006, Gray was charged with five counts of capital murder in the Harvey killings: one charge for killing more than once in a three-year period, one charge for committing more than one killing in a single act, one charge for killing in commission of a robbery, and two charges for killing a child under 14 years of age. On the same day, Dandridge was charged with three counts of capital murder in the Tucker-Baskerville killings. Gray pleaded not guilty, and his defense team sought leniency by presenting evidence of physical and sexual abuse during childhood as well as PCP use during the commission of the crimes. "

Four non-profitable competitions are organised independently every year to promote the national popular music to Eurovision fans from around the world. The international organisation works frequently in cooperation with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in order to help promote the Eurovision Song Contest, and has also established a strong relationship with the national broadcasting companies from across the participating countries. The current President of the OGAE International Network is Maiken Mäemets from OGAE Finland, who succeeded the role in 2011 from Antonis Karatzikos of OGAE Greece.

Several other countries around Europe and beyond that do not have their own independent OGAE Network; including Australia, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Monaco, San Marino, South Africa, and the United States of America; participate under the name 'OGAE Rest of the World'. Every year the organisation arranges four non-profitable competitions - Song Contest, Second Chance Contest, Video Contest and Home Composed Song Contest. The cooperative exercise of the OGAE Network is to raise awareness of popular national music across the world, in collaboration with the fans of the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as establishing a strenuous relationship between national broadcasting companies and the marketing of the Eurovision Song Contest itself to a wider fan-base. In 2007, Antonis Karatzikos was elected as new International Coordinator for OGAE, until 2009. In July 2009 was re-elected for the same post. In 2011, OGAE International Network became a registered organisation in France, and Maiken Mäemets was elected President.

OGAE Branches. OGAE currently has 40 members, including two in Germany. These are: OGAE Rest of the World. Countries that do not have an OGAE Network in their own right, but are active or associate members of the EBU are unified under the name 'Rest of the World'. The countries which constitute this OGAE Network are  OGAE Contests. OGAE Eurovision Song Contest Poll. The Marcel Bezençon Fan Award was handed out in 2002 and 2003, and voted on by the members of OGAE, the Eurovision international fan club. It was discontinued and replaced by the Composer Award in 2004. Every year since 2007, OGAE has conducted a pre-Eurovision Contest poll in which every national club plus OGAE Rest of the World vote all entries, using the same scoring system of Eurovision Voting (the most voted songs on each club receive 1 to 8, and then 10 and 12 points, and countries can't vote for themselves). The winners of this poll are: OGAE Song Contest. The OGAE Song Contest is an audio event in which all OGAE national clubs can enter with an original song released in the previous 12 months in their countries, and sung in one of the country's official languages. OGAE Second Chance Contest. The OGAE Second Chance Contest is a visual event which was founded in 1987 and is organised by branches of OGAE, the international fan club of the Eurovision Song Contest. Four nations competed in the first contest which took place in 1987. The contest was previously a non-televised event, but evolved over the years by the usage of video tape and nowadays DVD and Youtube. Each summer following the Eurovision Song Contest, each branch can enter one song that failed to win the country's national selection process for the annual Eurovision Song Contest. The members of each club choose amongst the songs that did not win and select one to represent the club in the event. Votes are cast by members of the OGAE clubs and are returned to the OGAE branch organising the particular year's event. Guest juries have been used to cast votes since 1993. OGAE Video Contest. The OGAE Video Contest is a video event in which, much like the OGAE Song Contest, all OGAE national clubs can enter with an original song and video released in the previous 12 months in their countries. There is no obligation on the entry for the OGAE Video Contest to be sang in one of the country's official language. "
wikipedia-3996238," Fatmir Sejdiu  Fatmir Sejdiu (born 23 October 1951) is a politician from Kosovo. He was the leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and was the first President of the Republic of Kosovo. Early life and education. He was born in the small village of Pakaštica, Podujevo, Yugoslavia (today Kosovo). He finished the primary school and high school in Podujevo. On 1974, he graduated in the Faculty of Law of the University of Pristina where he also doctorated. He served as a professor at the University of Pristina, teaching throughout his tenure as a Parliamentarian. He speaks Albanian, English, Serbian, and French. Political career. Sejdiu was an early protester against Yugoslav authoritarian rule and had for many years in his academic office a portrait depicting himself and fellow political party leader Veton Surroi locking arms before the riot police. He has always been widely admired for being honest and fair in all his political dealings. Due to persisting conflicts between the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the security forces of Yugoslavia, the Kosovo War broke out in 1996 between the two factions. Accusations of widespread abuse by government forces towards ethnic Albanians in 1999 ignited the second part of the war in which NATO forces unleashed a bombing campaign against the government. The war ended in mid-1999, and Kosovo was placed under a UN Protectorate of autonomy where Ibrahim Rugova became the president of the territory. President Sejdiu succeeded Rugova and became the first president of Kosovo when it declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. Sejdiu served in each of the Presidencies of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) as well as serving on the Presidency of the Assembly of Kosovo and was one of the authors of the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo in 2001. He was an influential parliamentarian in the LDK, the party of former Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova. He was elected President by the Kosovo Assembly after Rugova died from lung cancer in early 2006. Sejdiu has won praise from world leaders for prioritising implementation of the UN-endorsed standards of good governance and multi-ethnicity. On 24 July 2006, Sejdiu attended in Vienna the first high-level meeting between the prime ministers and presidents of Kosovo and Serbia to discuss the future status of Kosovo. On 9 January 2008, Sejdiu resigned from his position as President of Kosovo to run again in the following elections held the same day. This would allow him to start a completely new term with the inauguration of the new legislature, given that there are no term limits established by the Constitution Framework. He received 68 votes out of 81 needed for his election after a third round of parliamentary vote, when a simple majority of 61 votes is required for the election of the president and regained the position. His opponent, Naim Maloku of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), running with the support of three minor parties, obtained 37 votes in the first round. Sejdiu received one vote less in the second round, while 37 deputies chose Maloku. Sejdiu was elected in the third round of voting later on the same day. On 27 September 2010, he stepped down from the post of president of the Republic of Kosovo. Prior to his resignation, Constitutional Court of Kosovo stated that Fatmir Sejdiu was violating the Constitution of Kosovo, because he was both president of the Republic of Kosovo and also leader of Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). In November 2010, he lost the LDK leadership election to Isa Mustafa "

wikipedia-3996322," Varman dynasty  The Varman dynasty (350-650), the first historical rulers of Kamarupa; was established by Pushya Varman, an contemporary of Samudragupta. This dynasty became vassals of the Gupta Empire, but as the power of the Guptas waned, Mahendra Varman (470-494) performed two horse sacrifices and threw off the imperial yoke. The first of the three Kamarupa dynasties, the Varmans were followed by the Mlechchha and then the Pala dynasties. Genealogy. The genealogy of the Varman dynasty appears most fully in the Dubi and Nidhanpur copper plate inscriptions of the last Varman king, Bhaskar Varman (650-655), where Pushya Varman is named the founder.  The Dubi copper plate inscription of Bhaskar Varman asserts that Pushya Varman was born in the family of Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta (as did the other two Kamarupa dynasties) three thousand years after these mythical ancestors. The middle or Mlechha (Mech) dynasty, though claim same descent, are native tribal rulers. K.L. Barua opines that there was a Mlechha (i.e., Mech) revolt in Kamarupa and Salastambha, the leader or governor of the Mlecchas usurped the throne by deposing Bhaskar Varman's immediate successor Avanti Varman. Ethnic origins. The dynasty traces its lineage from legendary Naraka, an immigrant from Aryavarta (land of Aryans). Historical documents and legends are contradictory on the ethnicity of this dynasty. Naraka, according to an early account was the son of an ""asura"" named Hiranksha and Bhumi (Earth). In the late 10th-century Kalika Purana, Naraka is said to be the son of Vishnu in his Varaha form and Bhumi, who grew up in household of Janaka. The Kalika Purana goes on to describe two Narakas: one who was religious and the other who was hostile to Brahminism. The relationship of Bhagadatta, also mentioned as an ancestor of the Varmans, with Naraka is not clear from legendary sources either: Bhagadatta is called a grandson (Kalika Purana), a son (Bhagavata Purana) or not specified at all (Mahabharata, Harivamsha and Vishnu Purana). In the Mahabharata, a much earlier text, Bhagadatta, the son of Naraka is mentioned as ""Mleccha"", an appellation used for non-Indo-Aryans. All three Kamarupa dynasties draw their lineage from Naraka and Bhagadatta. Yuan Chwang called Bhaskar Varman a Brahman king who originated with Narayana Deva. On the other hand, Bhaskar Varman boasts of different ancestary when work with other countries, like he told ""She-Kia-Fang-Che"" that his ancestors hailed from China, four thousand years ago, flying through air as holy spirit. Sylvain writes, ""At the time of Hiuan-tsang's visit King Bhaskaravarman, was ""a descendant of the God Narayana"" ; he was ""of the caste of the Brahman, as,"" and had the title of "" Kumara."" ""Since the possession of the kingdom by his family up to his time, the succession of princes covers a space of a thousand generations"" (Mem.II,77.)The evidence of his contemporary Bana (Harsacarita, chap. VII) confirms almost all these details. Finally we possess since a few years ago an inscription of King Bhaskaravarman (Nidhanpur plates,Ep.Ind.,XII,65), which takes back the genealogy up to King Bhagadatta, the famous adversary of the by a long list of ancestors. However, when he had business with others than Indians, the same prince boasted of another origin altogether. When the envoy of the T'ang dynasty, Li Yi-piao, paid him a visit during the course of his mission (643-646) the king in a private conversation told him: ""the royal family has handed down its power for 4,000 years. The first was a holy spirit which came from China (""Han-ti"") flying through the air."" (""She-kia fang tche"", ed. Tok. XXXV, 1, 94b, ""col. ult."") As though he would show sympathy for China, he asked the envoy to get him a portrait of Lao-tseu and a Sanskrit translation of the Tao-to-king. (""She-kia fang tche"", ed. Tok. XXXV, 1, 94b, ""col. ult.""). Many scholars, including Kamarupa Anusandhan Samiti have speculated that the Varman dynasty as the first Indo-Aryan dynasty in Assam, that was overthrown by Salastambha of Mongoloid origin, who then made himself the king of Kamarupa. Suniti Kumar Chatterjee calls Bhaskar Varman a mleccha king, though scholars establised that only middle dynasty of Haruppeshwara (Tezpur) is of mleccha or non-Aryan origin. Urban terms all kings of Brahmaputra Valley as non-Aryans. Kanak Lal Barua refutes any extra Aryan origin of dynasty. In his ""Early History Of Kamarupa"", he writes, ""Suffice is to say that he (Bhaskar Varman) was Hindu by religion spreading light of Arya Dharma though he has great preverence for learned Buddhist priests and professors of his time and was distinctly inclined towards Buddhism. The text of his message to Silabhadra leave no doubt in this point. The very high functions allotted to him during the famous religious assembly at Kanauj by the Hindu emperor Sri Harsha proves that he was not a Hindu of despised low caste. He was undoubtedly looked upon as a good Kshatriya, as his surname Varma indicates, whatever might have been his origin. In any case he was certainly not a Hinduized Koch. All the kings of his dynasty beginning from Pushya Varman were Kshatriya monarchs. When Yuan Chwang visited the kingdom he found hundreds of Hindu temples there and evidently there were large numbers of Brahmans and other high caste Hindus living within the kingdom which was a seat of learning that people of other countries came there for study"" Politics and diplomacy. The most illustrious of this dynasty was the last, Bhaskar Varman, who claimed be a descendant from god Vishnu and referred to as ""lord of eastern India"". He accompanied King Harshavardhana to religious processions from Patliputra to Kannauj. Kings of Varman dynasty maintained both diplomatic and matrimonial relations with other countries of Aryavarta. Pushya Varman who himself named after king Pusyamitra Sunga, named his son Samudra Varman after king Samudragupta in appreciations of kings of Aryavarta.  King Bala Varman organised Swayamvara for his daughter Amrita Prabha; which was attended by princes of different countries. Princess eventually chosen prince of Kashmir Meghavahana as her groom. The alliance between king Harsha of Thanesar and Bhaskar Varman lead to spread of political influence of later to entire eastern India. Cultural environment. In Nidhanpur copper plate inscription of Bhaskar Varman, it is mentioned that ""prakasit aryadharmaloka"" i.e. king (Bhaskar Varman) spread the light of the Arya religion by dispelling the accumulated darkness of Kaliyuga. Yuan Chwang writes about existence of hundreds of Hindu temples. Brahmins and upper caste Hindus makes large chunk of lands population. Being a seat of learning people from other countries visits for studies. "
wikipedia-3996332," Plunge pool  A plunge pool (or plunge basin or waterfall lake) is a depression at the base of a waterfall created by the falling water scouring where it lands.  It also refers to a corresponding constructed recreational garden feature. It is a stream pool, lake, or pond that is small in diameter, but deep. http://www.scalloway.org.uk/images/water_f.jpg Formation. Plunge pools are formed under the force of a natural source, such as a waterfall or rapids, but also as the result of scour from man-made objects such as spillways and bridge abutments. The swirling water, sometimes carrying rocks within it, erodes the riverbed into a basin, often featuring irregular and rough sides. Plunge pools can remain after the waterfall has ceased to exist or the stream has been diverted. Plunge pools are erosional features which occur in the youthful stage of a river. When soft rock has been eroded back to a knickpoint, water constantly bombards its base. Because this rock is often less dense than surrounding strata, the water from the higher grade continues eroding downward. Garden feature. A plunge pool, also known as a cold plunge, can be a recreational water feature in landscape design, and constructed in gardens. They can be small-diameter swimming pools used for wading in warmer climates or adjacent to saunas.  These plunge pools are built to the same codes and specifications as swimming pools in regards to structural engineering, sanitation and filtration requirements, safety and liability precautions, and building permits. They can be unheated in climates without seasonal freezing, since their purpose is not for active recreation or exercise. Their smaller surface and ease of covering reduce evaporative water losses, and need for potable water refilling. Their popularity has increased with concerns and needs for domestic water conservation, more sustainable landscaping design, and reduction of resource consumption with energy-efficient landscaping. "
wikipedia-3996392," Progressive retinal atrophy  Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a group of genetic diseases seen in certain breeds of dogs and, more rarely, cats. Similar to retinitis pigmentosa in humans, it is characterized by the bilateral degeneration of the retina, causing progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. The condition in nearly all breeds is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with the exception of the Siberian Husky (inherited as an X chromosome linked trait) and the Bullmastiff (inherited as an autosomal dominant trait). There is no treatment. Diagnosis. Progressive vision loss in any dog in the absence of canine glaucoma or cataracts can be an indication of PRA. It usually starts with decreased vision at night, or nyctalopia. Other symptoms include dilated pupils and decreased pupillary light reflex. Fundoscopy to examine the retina will show shrinking of the blood vessels, decreased pigmentation of the nontapetal fundus, increased reflection from the tapetum due to thinning of the retina, and later in the disease a darkened, atrophied optic disc. Secondary cataract formation in the posterior portion of the lens can occur late in the disease. In these cases diagnosis of PRA may require electroretinography (ERG). For many breeds there are specific genetic tests of blood or buccal mucosa for PRA. Absent a genetic test, animals of breeds susceptible to PRA can be cleared of the disease only by the passage of time—that is, by living past the age at which PRA symptoms are typically apparent in their breed. Breeds in which the PRA gene is recessive may still be carriers of the gene and pass it on to their offspring, however, even if they lack symptoms, and it is also possible for onset of the disease to be later than expected, making this an imperfect test at best. Types of PRA. Generalized PRA is the most common type and causes atrophy of all the neural retinal structures. Central progressive retinal atrophy (CPRA) is a different disease from PRA involving the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and is also known as retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy (RPED). Generalized PRA can be divided into either dysplastic disease, where the cells develop abnormally, and degenerative, where the cells develop normally but then undergo a damaging change. PRA can be further divided into affecting either rod or cone cells. Rod cells detect shape and motion, and function in dim light. Cone cells detect color and definition, and function in bright light. Generalized PRA. Commonly affected breeds: Rod-cone dysplasia. This type of PRA has an early onset of severe vision loss. It is caused by a defect in the gene for cGMP-phosphodiesterase, which leads to retinal levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate ten times normal. Photoreceptor dysplasia. This is caused by an abnormal development of both rod and cone cells. Dogs are initially night blind and then progress to day blindness. Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD). This is a disease with normal rod and cone cell development but late onset degeneration of the rod cells that progresses to the cone cells. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and has been linked to the ninth canine chromosome. X-linked PRA. This condition is linked to the X chromosome. Central progressive retinal atrophy (CPRA). CPRA is also known as retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy (RPED). The cause of this condition is the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium's ability to effectively process the photoreceptor outer segment (POS) and subsequent accumulation of POS material in the RPE and loss of function. The loss of function of the RPE leads to photoreceptor degeneration. Vitamin E deficiency may play a role in the development of CPRA. It is characterized by accumulation of pigment spots in the retina surrounded by retinal atrophy and a mottled appearance of the pigmented nontapetal fundus. The pigmented spots eventually coalesce and fade as the atrophy of the retina increases. It is an inherited condition (in the Labrador Retriever it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance). CPRA occurs in older dogs. Peripheral vision is retained for a long time. Vision is better in low light and better for moving or distant objects. Not all affected dogs go blind. Secondary cataracts are common. Commonly affected breeds. It can also be found in the poodle varieties Hereditary retinal dysplasia. There is another retinal disease in Briards known as hereditary retinal dysplasia. These dogs are night blind from birth, and day vision varies. Puppies affected often have nystagmus. It is also known as lipid retinopathy. "
wikipedia-3996404," The Lightning Strike  ""The Lightning Strike"" is a song from alternative rock band Snow Patrol's fifth album ""A Hundred Million Suns"", and appears as the last track on the album. The lyrics to the song were written by lead singer Gary Lightbody and the music was composed by Snow Patrol. The song is composed of three smaller songs and, at sixteen minutes and eighteen seconds, is the longest the band has released yet. The song has an elaborate live performance where a specially made animation is played simultaneously as the band performs the song. Most of the video features origami, which is the main artwork for the album and its singles. The song received a mixed reaction when the album was released, and though the band were praised for playing it live, the general feeling was that it wasn't a right choice, with one critic calling it ""self-indulgent"" but forgivable. Conception and composition. In an interview with ""The Daily Telegraph"", lyricist Gary Lightbody revealed the song was conceived after he was caught in a heavy storm one night in Glasgow: ""I was pretty terrified - 150-mile-an-hour winds, trees falling down. But we went outside the house, and it was also just thrilling. There was this howling wind, but it felt like silence, as if our senses were being too bombarded to cope with what was going on. So the record was born out of that feeling, of two people having a protective shell around each other. I'm not saying there's not darkness in there still, but it's happening from outward factors more than inward. Maybe things are terrifying, but they're beautiful, too. The world is extremely surprising"". In August 2008, Lightbody joked about the song in a press release on the band's website, which revealed the track-listing for the then unreleased album: ""The last song is sixteen-minutes long and by far the longest we've ever done. Don't be frightened though, it's great. Although, for now, you'll have to take my word for that and I'm pretty biased I have to say"". At the time of the release of the album, SP.com posted a section featuring Gary Lightbody discussing the new songs, which was initially a Lightbody interview to RTÉ. The interview revealed that the song was initially three different songs. However, the band felt that they ""worked so well together it was obvious they belonged in one place"". He elaborated more on the fact in another interview with ""The Sun"": ""Just in case anybody gets frightened that we have a 16-minute song, it's a song in three parts, that we really wanted to be married together in a strange ceremony. I don't have the concentration span to write a 16-minute song. I get bored easily. But each song of the three seemed to explain the other one a lot better and they were all written around the same time and so I guess it's an unusual way of presenting them."" Recording and production. The three songs are ""What If This Storm Ends?"", ""The Sunlight Through the Flags"", and ""Daybreak"". ""What If This Storm Ends?"" was recorded at Olympic Studios in London and features brass choir. The second part, ""The Sunlight Through the Flags"", is set on the west coast of Ireland and was recorded at Grouse Lodge, Co. Westmeath, Ireland. According to the wishes of producer Jacknife Lee, the third and last part, ""Daybreak"", was recorded at Hansa Tonstudios in Berlin, where David Bowie recorded """"Heroes"""" in the '70s and U2 recorded ""Achtung Baby"" in the '90s. Lightbody commented that ""Daybreak"" ""was really affected by Hansa"" and ""has that Krautrock hypnotic sway to it, and ""Heroes""-type guitars swooning over the top"", and it made a fitting end to the album. The band specifically chose to keep the song the last track on the album. In an interview, Lightbody said ""We felt like it hopefully leaves you wondering ""what's next?"", making you want more"". In an interview to ""Glide Magazine"", Nathan Connolly spoke of the band's desire to not sound like their earlier work, but still maintain their ""melody and honesty"". The song grew out of the band trying to progress musically. Connolly also felt that the song requires repeated listening to grow on a person, like acquired taste. Release history. The song initially appeared on the album versions of ""A Hundred Million Suns"". On various online music stores including the iTunes Store, the song is labeled ""album-only"", making it inaccessible for individual purchase. A live MP3, recorded during the UK & Ireland Arena Tour of February–March 2009 was gifted to fans as a free download on every ticket purchase for the Reworked Tour of November–December 2009. Each ticket came with a special code that enabled the download. In light of its usage in the ""Epic"" trailer, on 25 February 2013, ""The Lightning Strike (What If This Storm Ends?)"" was released as a stand-alone single. Furthermore, on 9 March 2013, the band announced on social media websites such as Facebook that they had released the accompanying music video on their YouTube channel. The stand-alone ""What If This Storm Ends"" is to be released on the 2013 Snow Patrol compilation, entitled ""Greatest Hits"". Reception. The song received a generally mixed reception at the time of album release. ""Spin"" called it ""dramatic"". ""Rolling Stone"" was quite positive about the song, saying ""the band distinguishes itself from the post-Coldplay pack with a flair for arrangements that almost justifies the grandiosity of 16-minute epics like ""The Lightning Strike"""". PopMatters' response was very positive. Reviewer Ross Langager called the song ""a 16-minute, three-movement celestial metaphor of operatic grandeur and overwhelming beauty"". He further praised the song, saying: ""Linked together by alike synthesizer bedrocks of gradually increasing warmth and brightness, the song-cycle progresses from silver-lined dark clouds to hints of dawn before finally settling on a lovely, sun-drenched morning. But even when faced by such an inexorable process of hopefulness, Lightbody has to temper the surge of light: ""Slowly the day breaks/Apart in our hands"""". ""The Independent""'s Andy Gill, however, had mixed feelings about the song. He said that the song was an attempt to ""broaden the band's style"". He called it ambitious and felt that ""its incorporation of minimalist techniques, glockenspiel, brass colouration and shoegazey guitar textures"" made the song ""lengthy"". He made comparisons with Coldplay, calling the band ""self-absorbed"" but said Snow Patrol were ""more bearable"". On the other hand, Pitchfork Media's Joshua Love reviewed the song negatively, writing that it seemed as if the band was ""striving to be taken more seriously"", by ""stringing together three ponderous, already-overlong songs and calling the impenetrable result a 16-minute stand-alone epic ""The Lightning Strike"""". He further wrote that the band's wasn't talented enough to do justice to ""these newer, more artful ambitions"". Live-performance reception. Critical reception of the live performance has been generally mixed as well, though the band has been praised for playing it. Contactmusic.com reviewed a Snow Patrol concert at the M.E.N. Arena on 7 March 2009. Though it called the song ""ambitious by anyone's standards"" and praised the animation calling it ""impressive"", it felt the song wasn't the best choice for an encore. WalesOnline's Paul Rowland wrote a review of the gig at Cardiff International Arena the next day. He praised the song, calling it a ""three-movement epic"". He reported that, though the song was a welcome change in the encore, some fans did not appreciate it and headed home: ""After all, they'd already heard ""Run"", and the traffic's awful this time of night"". The same happened at a free gig at iTunes Festival 2009 at The Roundhouse in London. In ""The News"", Chris Jefferies reported that the band had to play the song to a ""half-empty crowd"", but had praise for the band saying ""there is much, much more to this band"". Durham21's Ian Church covered the next gig on 10 March at the Metro Radio Arena. He reported that for the encore, a large semi-transparent sheet was dropped in front of the stage, to project the animation. He said that it was ""surprising"" the band chose to play the ""practically unknown"" song, but reported that ""it somehow managed to capture those watching"" but a few fans were left complaining about the song choice. Journal Live also covered the concert, with Helen Dalby writing that it was ""interesting"" and ""different"" for the band to play the song, but she wasn't ""entirely sure it quite worked"". She felt the song might have worked if it was played earlier in the set. ""Evening Standard""'s Amira Hashish covered the last concert at The O2 and wrote a positive review about the performance of the song, though she felt to song(s) was ""lesser known""; but, she felt the band brought them to life and, though it was ""a little self-indulgent"", the band could be forgiven. James Cabooter of Daily Star, who covered the show at Bloomsbury Theatre wrote that the newer material (including ""The Lightning Strike"") was deeper and more mature sonically. Chart performance. ""What If This Storm Ends?"" reached the top 400 on iTunes shortly following its release. Music video. Live-performance version. ""The Lightning Strike"" has an elaborate live performance, with the band playing the song in the backdrop of a projection screen, on which a specially made video is played simultaneously; one such performance, at the Pinkpop Festival at Megaland, Landgraaf, the Netherlands, is available via the band's VEVO YouTube channel. The idea for the video was conceived by Gary Lightbody. Snow Patrol's tour video director Blue Leach collaborated with production company Atticus Finch to create the video, which represents Lightbody's idea to represent the world as origami. Finch brought Undabo Studios into the project to ""help develop an origami style of modeling and texturing"" that appears on the album artwork for ""A Hundred Million Suns"". The video's theme uses a colorful visual language; the birth and development of a star, a spiralling galaxy, and its millions of pieces, which flow smoothly into each other; the formation of space, birds, animated rockets, satellites, fishes, havens, oceans, boats, cities, landscapes, rainbows, cars, and planets and many other visual impressions. The ""CGI origami"" gig features the band members themselves performing as origami figures. The video was made using Autodesk Softimage and took about three months to make. It consists of 24,000 frames of animation and is played of a 60×40 ft. projection screen in live performances for the first 6 minutes, which then moves to LED screens suspended behind the band. Director Blue Leach later won the ""TPi Award"" in 2009 for his work with Snow Patrol, amongst others. Full animated version. The full sixteen-minute animated video for ""The Lightning Strike"", which was previously unavailable saw its official release as a part of ""Up to Now"", the band's third compilation album. The video can be found on the bonus DVDs of the Digipak and box-set releases of the album. ""What If This Storm Ends?"" animated version. A four-minute animated video for the ""What If This Storm Ends?"" was uploaded by the band onto YouTube. Like videos for live performances, the video features an elaborate animation involving origami. Live performances. The Taking Back the Cities Tour has generally featured ""What If This Storm Ends?"" as an encore. The full song has usually not been played, but it has been known to make appearances; it finally made its live debut during the UK & Ireland Arena Tour, where it was played regularly. It also made appearances during the following European leg, though it was not played on all dates. The song was not played during the shows with the band supporting Coldplay on the Viva la Vida Tour and U2 on the U2 360° Tour. In popular culture. The full song was used in ""Don't Cry for Me, Albuquerque"", an episode of ""In Plain Sight"", in 2009, while the first part of the song, ""What If This Storm Ends?"", appeared in a 2011 trailer for the war movie ""Act of Valor"", starring real-life Navy SEALs, and in the trailers to the 2013 animated film ""Epic"".

wikipedia-3996407," The Defense  The Defense is the third novel written by Vladimir Nabokov during his emigration to Berlin, published in 1930. Publication. The novel appeared first under Nabokov's penname V. Sirin in the Russian emigre quarterly ""Sovremennye Zapiski"" and was thereafter published by the emigre publishing house Slovo as ""Защита Лужина"" (The Luzhin Defense) in Berlin. More than three decades later the novel was translated into English by Michael Scammell in collaboration with Nabokov and appeared in 1964. In the foreword to the English edition Nabokov states that he wrote ""The Defense"" in 1929 while he vacationed in Le Boulou (""hunting butterflies"") and then finished it in Berlin. He links the events in the central chapters to moves as encountered in chess problems. Plot summary. The plot concerns the title character, Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin. As a boy, he is considered unattractive, withdrawn, and an object of ridicule by his classmates. One day, when a guest comes to his father's party, he is asked whether he knows how to play chess. This encounter serves as his motivation to pick up chess. He skips school and visits his aunt's house to learn the basics. He quickly becomes a great player, enrolling in local competitions and rising in rank as a chess player. His talent is prodigious and he attains the level of a Grandmaster in less than ten years. As his obsession with chess grows, he becomes socially detached and physically unhealthy. At a resort, he meets a young girl, never named in the novel, whose interest he captures. They become romantically involved, and Luzhin eventually proposes to her. Things turn for the worse when he is pitted against Turati, a grandmaster from Italy, in a competition to determine who would face the current world champion. Before and during the game, Luzhin has a mental breakdown, which climaxes when his carefully planned defense against Turati fails in the first moves, and the resulting game fails to produce a winner. When the game is suspended Luzhin wanders into the city in a state of complete detachment from reality. He is returned home and brought to a rest home, where he eventually recovers. His doctor convinces Luzhin's fiancée that chess was the reason for his downfall, and all reminders of chess are removed from his environment. Slowly however, chess begins to find its way back into his thoughts (aided by incidental occurrences, such as an old pocket chessboard found in a coat pocket, or an impractical chess game in a movie). Luzhin begins to see his life as a chess game, seeing repetitions of 'moves' that return his obsession with the game. He desperately tries to find the move that will defend him from losing his chess life-game, but feels the scenario growing closer and closer.  Eventually, after an encounter with his old chess mentor, Valentinov, Luzhin realizes that he must ""abandon the game,"" as he puts it to his wife (who is desperately trying to communicate with him). He locks himself in the bathroom (his wife and several dinner guests banging on the door). He climbs out a window, and it is implied he falls to his death, but the ending is deliberately vague. The last line of the (translated) novel reads: ""The door was burst in. 'Aleksandr Ivanovich, Aleksandr Ivanovich,' roared several voices. But there was no Aleksandr Ivanovich."" Major characters. Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin: The protagonist of the novel. As a child, he is misunderstood by his parents and mistreated by his peers, and is generally sullen in complexion and demeanor. He has no friends. As an adult, he is corpulent, socially inept, and absent-minded. He has a nervous breakdown during his match with the Italian grandmaster Turati. Luzhin's wife: She marries Luzhin after much protest from her mother and father. She is initially drawn to the air of mystery that surrounds the chess master and feels compassion for his social ineptitude. She takes on a motherly role in her marriage with Luzhin, and makes it her occupation to amuse him and keep his mind off of his unhealthy obsession with chess. She remains nameless in the novel.[http://www.lib.ru/NABOKOW/luzhin.txt] Valentinov: A confident man with a competent understanding of chess (he creates problems but does not play) who manages Luzhin's career through childhood. He uses the young Luzhin for his own gain and without much regard for Luzhin's personal development. Valentinov returns Luzhin to his father once he is no longer marketable as a child prodigy. Turati: The suave Italian grandmaster of chess. Luzhin has a nervous breakdown midway through the game with Turati. Comments. The character of Luzhin is based on Curt von Bardeleben, a chess master Nabokov knew personally. Bardeleben ended his life by jumping out of a window. Nabokov said of this novel: ""Of all my Russian books, ""The Defense"" contains and diffuses the greatest 'warmth' -– which may seem odd seeing how supremely abstract chess is supposed to be."" He later described this novel as the ""story of a chess player who was crushed by his genius, a concept explored in ""The Relentless Combination: Chess and the Patterns of Madness in Vladimir Nabokov's ""The Defense"""" (Glen Downey, ""The Antigonish Review"" #121. [http://www.antigonishreview.com/bi-121/121-downey.html]) The book was also influenced by the Soviet film ""Chess Fever"" (1925). Movie adaption. The book was adapted to film in 2000, as ""The Luzhin Defence."" It was directed by Marleen Gorris, and starred John Turturro as Luzhin. "
wikipedia-3996438," Flexor retinaculum of the hand  The flexor retinaculum (transverse carpal ligament, or anterior annular ligament) is a strong, fibrous band that arches over the carpus, converting the deep groove on the front of the carpal bones into a tunnel, the carpal tunnel, through which the Flexor tendons of the digits and the median nerve pass.  It is attached, medially, to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate bone; laterally, to the tubercle of the scaphoid, and to the medial part of the volar surface and the ridge of the trapezium.  It is continuous, superficially, with the volar carpal ligament; and deep, with the palmar aponeurosis. It is crossed by the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves. At its lateral end is the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which lies in the groove on the greater multangular between the attachments of the ligament to the bone.  On its volar surface the tendons of the palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris are partly inserted; below, it gives origin to the short muscles of the thumb and little finger. Clinical Significance. In carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammation of one of the nine tendons passing through the carpal tunnel causes pressure against the flexor retinaculum. However, the flexor retinaculum, being a sheath of tough connective tissue, has very limited stretching capabilities and is unable to accommodate the space necessary to relieve such pressure. Due to this increased pressure with no room to expand against either the bones of the wrist or the flexor retinaculum, the median nerve is ultimately compressed, resulting in the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. In treating carpal tunnel syndrome with surgical intervention (usually done after all non-surgical methods of treatment have been exhausted), the flexor retinaculum is always the structure targeted to relieve pressure in the carpal tunnel. In these surgeries, the flexor retinaculum is either simply severed or lengthened. When surgery is done to divide the flexor retinaculum (which is by far the more common procedure), scar tissue will eventually fill the gap left by surgery. The intent is that this will lengthen the flexor retinaculum enough to accommodate inflamed or damaged tendons and reduce the effects of compression on the median nerve. In a 2004 double blind-study, researchers concluded that there was no perceivable benefit gained from lengthening the flexor retinaculum during surgery and so division of the ligament remains the preferred method of surgery. "
wikipedia-3996523," Palmar aponeurosis  The palmar aponeurosis (palmar fascia) invests the muscles of the palm, and consists of central, lateral, and medial portions. Central portion. The central portion occupies the middle of the palm, is triangular in shape, and of great strength and thickness. Its apex is continuous with the lower margin of the transverse carpal ligament, and receives the expanded tendon of the palmaris longus. Its base divides below into four slips, one for each finger. Each slip gives off superficial fibers to the skin of the palm and finger, those to the palm joining the skin at the furrow corresponding to the metacarpophalangeal articulations, and those to the fingers passing into the skin at the transverse fold at the bases of the fingers. The deeper part of each slip subdivides into two processes, which are inserted into the fibrous sheaths of the flexor tendons. From the sides of these processes offsets are attached to the transverse metacarpal ligament. By this arrangement short channels are formed on the front of the heads of the metacarpal bones; through these the flexor tendons pass. The intervals between the four slips transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the lumbricales. At the points of division into the slips mentioned, numerous strong, transverse fasciculi bind the separate processes together. The central part of the palmar aponeurosis is intimately bound to the integument by dense fibroareolar tissue forming the superficial palmar fascia, and gives origin by its medial margin to the palmaris brevis. It covers the superficial volar arch, the tendons of the flexor muscles, and the branches of the median and ulnar nerves; and on either side it gives off a septum, which is continuous with the interosseous aponeurosis, and separates the intermediate from the collateral groups of muscles. Lateral and medial portions. The lateral and medial portions of the palmar aponeurosis are thin, fibrous layers, which cover, on the radial side, the muscles of the ball of the thumb, and, on the ulnar side, the muscles of the little finger; they are continuous with the central portion and with the fascia on the dorsum of the hand. "
wikipedia-3996607," Sudden acquired retinal degeneration  Sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS) is a disease in dogs causing sudden blindness. It can occur in any breed, but female dogs may be predisposed. Approximately 4000 cases are seen in the United States annually. The cause of SARDS is considered to be idiopathic and the veterinary community is divided as to its cause, but the disease possibly involves autoimmune disease, toxins, elevations in adrenal sex hormones or Cushing's disease.  Symptoms include sudden permanent blindness, but may occur more slowly over several days, weeks or months, dilated pupils, and loss of the pupillary light reflex. Other symptoms commonly seen are similar to those seen with Cushing's disease and include increased water consumption and urination, weight gain, confusion, restlessness, behavioral changes and lethargy. These symptoms may develop over a few months preceding the onset of SARD. Despite similar symptoms and blood test results to Cushing's disease, evaluation of dogs with SARD did not reveal any tumors in the pituitary or adrenal glands. However, endocrine testing (i.e., Canine Adrenal Panel at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine Endocrinology Service) often shows elevations in adrenal sex hormones. Clinical signs and disease progression vary markedly among individual animals, depending on the number and type of hormones that are increased, the degree of hormone elevation, and the age of the dog. Autoimmune disease as a cause has also been called into question because of a lack of antiretinal autoantibodies in dogs with SARD in one study. Examination with an ophthalmoscope will initially show no changes, but in a few months atrophy of the retina will resemble the appearance of progressive retinal atrophy. Pathologically, there is a loss of the rod and cone cells followed by degeneration of other layers of the retina. The retinal degeneration appears to be related to apoptosis of these cells. SARD must be distinguished from other causes of sudden blindness that have no visible pathology, including retrobulbar optic neuritis, a tumor at the optic chiasm, or other central nervous system diseases. Electroretinography is useful to definitively diagnose SARD. Currently there is no approved treatment, although the use of intravenous immunoglobulin has been investigated due to similarities between SARD and human immune-mediated retinopathy.  Endocrine testing by National Veterinary Diagnostic Services (the only laboratory that offers the endocrine-immune blood test developed by Alfred Plechner, DVM) revealed that some pets with SARDS had endocrine-immune abnormalities and physiological doses of cortisone and thyroid hormone were anecdotally shown to be beneficial to their overall health and vision. ""Adrenal exhaustion"" is a syndrome put forth by Ms. C. Levin, a lay person, who subscribes to the theories of Dr. Plechner. However, ""adrenal exhaustion"" (not to be confused with Addison's disease) is not recognized as a legitimate medical disorder in veterinary medicine and the condition has not been described in dogs (or cats). Moreover, this experimental hormone replacement therapy has not been approved or evaluated for efficacy and safety by the veterinary community, nor has it undergone scientific peer review in the mainstream veterinary literature. Some owners notice a more obvious ""eye shine"" in photographs due to the dilated pupils and retinal atrophy creating what is described as a ""hyper-reflective tapetum"". Additional information on SARDS may be found at this website http://www.sardsawareness.org which provides links to research carried out by Dr. Sinisa Grozdanic, D.V.M., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Comparative Ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa. The website provides a link to a Powerpoint presentation summarizing the work of Dr. Grozdanic and his co-researchers This is another link to a news release describing Dr. Grozdanic's work: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080304173310.htm Dr. Grozdanic has found that SARDS like symptoms may be related to a similar disorder which he calls Immune-Mediated Retinopathy, or IMR, which causes loss of function in retinal cells and, in some cases, blindness in canines. In SARDS cases there is permanent damage to retinal cells, but in IMR cases there is loss of function of the retinal cells which may be partially reversed by treatments developed by Dr. Grozdanic, and an affected dog's vision may be restored to a degree where the dog has functioning eyesight again. Not all dogs are candidates for his treatments, which may be contra-indicated by other underlying health disorders. "
wikipedia-3996623," Honda RVF400  The Honda RVF400R (NC35) is a motorcycle introduced by Honda Motor Company in 1994, powered by a V4 16 valve double overhead geardriven cam 400 cc engine and known for its supreme handling capabilities. There were two models, the R and the T, which differed only in their paint schemes. The RVF (as it was marketed by Honda in Japan) finished production in 1996, though unsold RVFs remained available to purchase from Japanese Honda dealers through to 2001. The RVF400R is the smaller sibling of RVF750R (RC45), as the VFR400R (NC30) was to the VFR750R (RC30). The Honda RVF400R was the successor to the Honda VFR400R NC30, which ceased production in 1993. While at first glance there appear to be mainly styling changes between the VFR400R and the RVF400R, the actual number of changes are vast as the entire bike was redesigned with numerous identical looking components being totally different. The obvious differences between the VFR400R and the RVF400R are that the front forks are of the upside-down type and the rear wheel takes a 17"" tyre (the Honda VFR400R took a 18""), there are two air tubes that feed fresh air to the area just in front of the air box (this is not a ram air system, the airbox is unpressurised) and the headlights have changed from twin round headlights to twin 'fox-eye' lights (this is one feature not mirrored from the RVF750R (RC45) as the RC45 features twin large round headlights). Unlike the VFR400R the RVF400R was only officially sold new in Japan. The RVF400R outputs slightly less peak power than the VFR400R (due to Japanese regulations at the time) but has a stronger midrange. There is a Haynes Manual for the RVF400R. Like other Hondas with gear-driven camshafts, the RVF's engine makes a loud 'whine' sound when operating. The exhaust note of the V4 engine is also different from that of a more conventional inline four. The 400 cc VFR and RVF models share a unique exhaust note with their larger siblings—the VFR750R RC30 and the RVF750R RC45—because of their 360-firing order ('big-bang') configuration.  The RVF400R has a reputation for excellent reliability and good build quality, though not quite as high as its predecessor, the VFR400R. VFR400 to RVF400 changes. Engine. The carburettors were changed, the RVF's carbs featuring a semi-flatslide design and smaller diameter venturis (30 mm against the NC30's 32 mm) but claimed to be better flowing, the velocity stacks were also changed to allow a straighter flow into the engine cylinders. The valve timing was changed with the exhaust valves opening earlier and closing later. The engine position was changed with large cast sections of the frame now holding the engine lower down (these lower engine mounting points were unused on the VFR). Frame and Suspension. While the front cartridge forks were changed from RWU to USD forks, they remained the same diameter (41 mm) and make (Showa). The frame was totally redesigned, with engine mounting and steering geometry changes. The swingarm while looking identical at first glance is narrower (192 mm against 202 mm) and runs on a smaller diameter spindle (17 mm against 22 mm) with the rear hub and brake mounting points changed. Wheels brakes and tyres. The rear wheel was changed from 18"" to 17"". The front brakes remained as 4 opposed piston calipers but the trailing pistons were increased in diameter from 25.4 mm to 27 mm (the leading pistons remained at 30 mm). The Honda RC30 was fitted with a 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' that linked the rear caliper to the frame via a linkage through the swingarm (reducing rear wheel hop under braking), the NC30 had the swingarm machined to allow a torque arm shaft and featured the cast boss on the frame but the linkage was not fitted (probably for cost reasons) and the caliper was instead held in place with a simple torque reaction arm bolted into the swingarm (it is possible to modify the NC30 to fit the 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage'). The RVF400 has lost all of this, the rear caliper is now held in place by a boss on the swingarm, it is not possible to easily modify the RVF400 to full 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' as the swingarm would require unmachining). It is possible on the VFR400 to change the rear brake disk without removing the rear hub, it is impossible to do this on the RVF400 as the mounting plate is larger and the entire hub requires removal. Exhaust. The exhaust has a number of changes, the main change is that the silencer and collector are now separate and the silencer is held to the frame by one mounting point rather than two. The silencer is now aluminium and held by 3 bolts to the collector. Dimensions and weights.

wikipedia-3996713," Tawassul  Tawassul () is the Islamic understanding of intercession. It is a religious practice in which a Muslim seeks nearness to Allah. A rough translation would be: ""To draw near to what one seeks after and to approach that which one desires."" The exact definition and method of tawassul is a matter of some dispute within the Muslim community. Origin. Muslims who practice tawassul point to the Qur'an, Islam's holy book, as the origin of the practice. Many Muslims believe it is a commandment upon them to ""draw near"" to Allah. Sunni Islam, as well as the Twelver Shi'a, refers it as the act of supplicating to Allah through a prophet, imam or Sufi saint, whether supposedly dead or alive. Martyrs are not considered dead in Islam, according to Allah's words in Quran  Intercession. Some Muslims also define tawassul as ""intercession"" with Allah, also pointing to the Qur'an in explanation of this. Muslims also believe that intercession is only with the ""permission"" of Allah. Muslims believe that the practice of seeking intercession began during the life of Muhammad. An oft-cited Hadith in support of this is one narrated from Uthman ibn Hunaif regarding a blind man who Muslims believe was healed through the process. Intercession in Sunni Islam. Sunni Muslims traditionally have believed that seeking intercession is only ""conditionally"" lawful: "

wikipedia-3996762," Masticophis flagellum  Masticophis flagellum is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake, commonly referred to as the coachwhip or the whip snake, which is endemic to the United States and Mexico. Seven subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies. Geographic range. Coachwhips range throughout the southern United States from coast to coast. They are also found in the northern half of Mexico.  Description. Coachwhips are thin-bodied snakes with small heads and large eyes with round pupils. They vary greatly in color, but most reflect a proper camouflage for their natural habitat. ""M. f. testaceus"" is typically a shade of light brown with darker brown flecking, but in the western area of Texas, where the soil color is a shade of pink, the coachwhips are also pink in color. ""M. f. piceus"" was given its common name because specimens frequently, but not always, have some red in their coloration. Coachwhip scales are patterned so at first glance, the snake appears braided. Subspecies can be difficult to distinguish in areas where their ranges overlap. Adult sizes of are common. The record sized specimen, of the Eastern coachwhip race, was . Young specimens, mostly just over in length, were found to have weighed , whereas good-sized mature adults measuring weighed in at . Habitat. Coachwhips are commonly found in open areas with sandy soil, open pine forests, old fields, and prairies. They thrive in sandhill scrub and coastal dunes. Behavior. Coachwhips are diurnal, and actively hunt and eat lizards, small birds, and rodents. They tend to be sensitive to potential threats, and often bolt at the first sign of one; they are extremely fast-moving snakes. They are curious snakes with good eyesight, and are sometimes seen raising their heads above the level of the grass or rocks to see what is around them. Myths. The primary myth concerning coachwhips, that they chase people, likely arises from the snake and the person both being frightened, and both just happening to be going the same way to escape. Coachwhips are fast snakes, often moving faster than a human, and thus give an impression of aggression should they move toward the person. The legend of the hoop snake may refer to the coachwhip snakes. Another myth of the rural southeastern United States is of a snake that, when disturbed, would chase a person down, wrap him up in its coils, whip him to death with its tail, and then make sure he is dead by sticking its tail up the victim's nose to see if he is still breathing. In actuality, coachwhips are neither constrictors(snakes that dispatch their prey by suffocating with their coils), nor strong enough to overpower a person. Also, they do not whip with their tails, even though their tails are long and look very much like a whips.  Their bites can be painful, but generally are harmless unless they become infected. "
wikipedia-3996774," Saddleworth Moor  Saddleworth Moor is an area of the South Pennines in Northern England. It is within the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park. The land reaches over above sea level. It is crossed by the A635 road and the Pennine Way passes to its eastern side. History. The moor takes its name from the parish of Saddleworth to the west, historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire although on the western side of the Pennines, but a part of Greater Manchester since 1974. The parts of the moor east of the present county boundary with West Yorkshire are known as Wessenden Moor and Wessenden Head Moor. The moor became infamous as the burial site of four victims of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, the Moors murderers. In October 1965 the bodies of Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride were discovered. Pauline Reade's body was recovered on 1 July 1987, but Keith Bennett is still missing. Geography. Saddleworth Moor straddles the metropolitan boroughs of Oldham in Greater Manchester and Kirklees in West Yorkshire. The moorland is an elevated plateau with gritstone escarpments or edges and, around its margins, deeply incised v-shaped valleys or cloughs with fast-flowing streams. (Clough is derived from the Old English ""cloh"" which means a deep valley or ravine.) The overlying peat is cut by drainage channels or groughs. The high moorland is sparsely inhabited. Scattered farmsteads, built of local gritstone, and fields demarcated by dry-stone walls are on the lower land and in the valleys where there is some coniferous woodland. Much of the area is open access land. The landscape is traversed by an A road between the Greater Manchester Urban Area and the West Yorkshire Urban Area. The A635 road, known locally as the Isle of Skye road, passes across the moor taking its name from a former public house at Wessenden Head which was demolished after a fire. The Pennine Way arrives from the Wessenden valley to the north and crosses the moor on its ascent to Black Hill on Holme Moss to the south. Vegetation. Blanket bog in the area is the most south-easterly occurrence in Europe. Cottongrass is the most dominant feature and sphagnum mosses scarce. Heather, crowberry, bilberry and the rare cloudberry are also found. There are extensive areas of bare peat from which the surface has eroded. The peat formation is 9,000 years old. Reservoirs. Dovestone Reservoir, east of Oldham, is accessed from the A635 road, one of four reservoirs in the valley supplying water to Manchester. The valley is surrounded by rocky outcrops and moorland. Spruce and pine plantations are found in the valley and broad-leaved trees have been introduced to provide a more diverse habitat. The first reservoir in the chain, Yeoman Hey, was built in 1880 and Chew Reservoir, built in 1914, was, when built, the highest reservoir in the British Isles at above sea level. The bed of the tramway, built to aid its construction remains visible. The area around the reservoir is used for recreation. References. Notes  Bibliography "

wikipedia-3996948," Slough Feg  Slough Feg (also known as The Lord Weird Slough Feg) is a heavy metal band that formed in Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Taking their name from the Celtic folklore-influenced comic Sláine, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1996. The band combines influences from traditional heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Brocas Helm and Thin Lizzy, and English folk metal band Skyclad. Slough Feg's 2003 album ""Traveller"" was a concept album based on GDW's role playing game of the same name. With the release of ""Atavism"" in 2005, the band officially shortened its name to Slough Feg. Guitarist Mike Scalzi maintains that the band always referred to itself this way internally, and the addition of ""The Lord Weird"" made it too difficult to find Slough Feg albums in stores (which alphabetized the CDs in inconsistent ways). Slough Feg is currently signed to Metal Blade Records and most recently released ""Laser Enforcer"" on July 5, 2013. Biography. Slough Feg originates from central Pennsylvania, but relocated to San Francisco, California in 1990 with the hopes of resurrecting the heavy metal scene in America. The band produced three demo tapes in the early 1990s before releasing their self-titled debut album. Bassist Justin Phelps left the band shortly after. In 1998, the European music label Dragonheart signed Slough Feg and the band released their second album ""Twilight of the Idols"" in 1999. The band released ""Down Among the Deadmen"" in 2000, and ""Traveller"" in 2003.  In 2005 the band moved to the Italian record label Cruz del Sur and released their fifth studio album, ""Atavism"". The band also officially shortened their name to, ""Slough Feg"" after the album's release. After the change of name, John Cobbett left in good terms with the band, and was replaced by current member Angelo Tringali in January 2005. Around the same time, drummer Greg Haa left the band for personal reasons, and was replaced by current member, Antoine Reuben-Diavola. In 2007 the band released their sixth album (their second with Cruz del Sur), ""Hardworlder"", recorded and produced with former bass player Justin Phelps. In 2008 the band released ""The Slay Stack Grows"" on Shadow Kingdom Records. This was a double-CD release of old demos and live recordings from the band's early days. The band toured in Europe, and the United States, doing coast-to-coast tours summers of 2005 and 2006, including an appearance at the first annual Alehorn of Power festival in Chicago, Illinois. In January 2013, Slough Feg signed to Metal Blade Records. "
wikipedia-3996971," Administrative divisions of India  The Administrative divisions of India are Indian subnational administrative units; they compose a nested hierarchy of country subdivisions. Indian states and territories frequently use different local titles for the same level of subdivision (e.g., the ""mandals"" of Andhra Pradesh correspond to ""tehsils"" of Uttar Pradesh and other Hindi-speaking states and taluka of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu). The smaller subdivisions (villages and blocks) exist only in rural areas. In urban areas Urban Local Bodies exist instead of these rural subdivisions. In the context of the Indian Constitution, local government bodies are the subject of the State List and are thereby governed by State Statutes, or in the case of Union Territories, by the Union Parliament. Federal recognition of local government was substantively expressed in the 74th Constitution Amendment Act of 1992. Zones. The States have been grouped into six zones having an Advisory Council 'to develop the habit of cooperative working” among these States. Six Zonal Councils were set up vide Part-III of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The present composition of each of these Zonal Councils is as under: The Northern Zonal Council, comprising the States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, National Capital Territory of Delhi and Union Territory of Chandigarh; The North-Eastern Council (NEC), comprising Assam Valley, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland; The North Central Zonal Council, comprising the States of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh; The Eastern Zonal Council, comprising the States of Chhattisgarh Jharkhand, Odisha, Sikkim and West Bengal,It is headquartered at West Bengal's capital Kolkatta); The Western Zonal Council, comprising the States of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli; and The Southern Zonal Council, comprising the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry. States and union territories. India is composed of 28 states and 7 union territories (including a national capital territory). The union territories are governed by administrators, appointed by the President of India. Two of the territories (Delhi and Puducherry) have been given partial statehood, with elected legislatures and executive councils of ministers, but limited powers. Regions. Some of the states of India are divided into regions. The Regions of India are not official administrative divisions. They have no official administrative governmental status. They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts. Divisions. Some of the Indian states are subdivided into divisions, each comprising several districts: Districts. States and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into Districts (""zilla""), of which there are 655. Sub-districts. Tehsils, talukas, blocks or mandals (sub-districts but can also refer to division), headed by a ""Tehsildar"" or ""Talukdar"", comprise several villages or village clusters. The governmental bodies at the Tehsil level are called the panchayat samiti. States use varying names for their sub-districts. Detailed information is as follows: Local level. Blocks. The block is often the next level of administrative division after the tehsil. Hoblis. A hobli is a subdivision of a taluka which groups adjoining villages in the state of Karnataka. They may have been made for administrative purposes by the revenue department of the state. Villages. Villages are often the lowest level of subdivisions in India. The governmental bodies at the village level are called Gram Panchayat, of which there were an estimated 256,000 in 2002. Each Gram Panchayat covers a large village or a cluster of smaller villages with a combined population exceeding 500 (Gram Group). Clusters of villages are also sometimes called Hobli or Patti. Habitations. Certain governmental functions and activities - including clean water availability, rural development, and education - are tracked at a sub-village level. These hamlets are termed ""habitations"". India is composed of approximately 1.6 million habitations. In some states, most villages have a single habitation; in others (notably Kerala and Tripura) there is a high ratio of habitations to villages. Municipalities. Municipalities of India are governed by Municipal Corporations ""(Mahanagar Paalika)"" for large urban areas, Municipal Council ""(Nagar Paalika)"" for smaller urban areas, and Town Councils ""(Nagar Panchayats)"" for suburban areas. Municipalities can be as large as a district or smaller than a Tehsil. "
wikipedia-3996979," Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami  The Archdiocese of Miami is a particular church of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States of America. Its ecclesiastic territory includes Broward, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties in the U.S. state of Florida. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see for the Ecclesiastical Province of Miami, which covers Florida. The archbishop is Thomas Wenski. As archbishop, he also serves as pastor of the Cathedral of Saint Mary, the mother church of the archdiocese. Also serving are 428 priests, 160 permanent deacons, 50 religious brothers and 300 religious sisters who are members of various religious institutes. These priests, deacons and persons religious serve a Catholic population in South Florida of 1,300,000 in 118 parishes and missions. Because of the vast number of immigrants, Mass is offered in at least a dozen languages in parishes throughout the archdiocese. Educational institutions consist of two schools for the disabled, 60 elementary/middle schools, 13 high schools, two universities, and two seminaries. Radio, print, and television media outlets owned and operated by the archdiocese supplement teaching, communication, and ministries. Several social service organizations are operated by the archdiocese which include two hospitals, nine health care centers, three homes for the aged, and two cemeteries. Charities include homeless shelters, legal services for the poor, an HIV/AIDS ministry, and the Missionaries of Charity and Society of Saint Vincent de Paul ministries to the poor. Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a separate non-profit organization operated by the archdiocese. It claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services to the needy in South Florida. History. Before 1952, the entire State of Florida was under the jurisdiction of one diocese, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Saint Augustine archbishop Joseph Patrick Hurley purchased land throughout South Florida in anticipation of a future population boom. Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas. The Diocese of Miami was created on October 7, 1958, with Coleman Carroll installed as bishop. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed one half of the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. This set off a mass exodus of Cuban exiles to South Florida. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. Operation Pedro Pan, created by Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006. Due to an increased population, the diocese was divided in 1968. Eight counties became part of the Diocese of St. Petersburg and the new Diocese of Orlando. Miami was made an archdiocese by Pope Paul VI, and was named Metropolitan See for all of Florida. Carroll became an archbishop on March 2, 1968. He participated in the church reforms of Vatican II as one of the Council Fathers. During the civil rights struggles of the 60's, Carroll was influential in stemming threatened racial riots in Miami and in desegregating Catholic schools roughly 10 years before the rest of the State. He became a founder of the Community Relations Board which worked to ""quell waves of misunderstanding, discrimination and discontent which often threatened to flood South Florida's multi-ethnic community."" Upon the death of Carroll on July 26, 1977, Bishop Edward Anthony McCarthy was appointed as Miami's archbishop. McCarthy oversaw the construction of the Pastoral Center for the archdiocese and restructured most senior operational divisions. He established the Office of Lay Ecclesial Ministry, the Office of Evangelization and the Permanent Diaconate program. In 1980, he offered support and assistance during the Mariel Boat Lift. The following year, he supported the rights of Haitian immigrants who were detained under the Wet Foot, Dry Foot policy. Responding to the needs of this new immigration, he opened the Pierre Toussaint Haitian Catholic Center. McCarthy retired in 1994 at the required age of 75. On November 3, 1994, Pope John Paul II appointed John C. Favalora as the third archbishop of Miami. During his tenure, he built two new high schools and nine grade schools. Favalora also initiated the Vision 2000 campaign, a five-year fundraising campaign that created an endowment fund to support Catholic education and outreach institutions in the archdiocese. The effort raised $90 million (USD). On July 11, 2003, Pope John Paul II appointed Miami auxiliary bishop Thomas Gerard Wenski to lead the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando. With substantial immigration of predominantly Catholic South and Central Americans to the South Florida area, the Catholic population there is 25% of the total population. Waves of immigrants from other parts of the world, including Asian and African countries, have led to Mass being celebrated in over a dozen different languages in parishes throughout the archdiocese. In 2009, Father Fernando Isern, of Our Lady of Lourdes, Kendall, was named the next bishop of Pueblo. He is the 11th priest from the archdiocese to be so designated since its creation in 1958. On April 20, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Archbishop John Favalora eight months early and appointed Bishop Thomas Wenski of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando as his successor. On June 1, 2010, Archbishop Wenski was installed as the fourth archbishop of the Archdiocese of Miami at the Cathedral of Saint Mary. Education. Schools. As of 2008, the Archdiocese of Miami provides a parochial school education to almost 40,000 students in 60 elementary/middle schools, 13 high schools and two non-residential schools for the disabled located throughout Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. The high schools supported by the archdiocese are: The archdiocese offers religious education classes in all of its 111 parishes for children who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists as teachers 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious education classes are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before they could work with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People. Universities. The Archdiocese of Miami oversees and administers two Catholic universities in Miami: St. Thomas University and Barry University. Together, these institutions enroll over 13,000 students. St. Thomas University offers Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Master's degree, Master of Business Administration, M.Acc., Doctor of Education, and Doctor of Philosophy. programs through its college and various schools.

wikipedia-3997006," Post-9/11  The post-9/11 period is the time after the September 11 attacks, characterized by heightened suspicion of non-Americans in the United States, increased government efforts to address terrorism, and a more aggressive American foreign policy.  There is some debate as to whether the post-9/11 period is ongoing. While anti-terrorism is still a prominent part of American policy, other issues have come to overshadow it. Political consequences. The attacks led to significant and widespread changes in U.S. politics and foreign policy. Domestically, both parties rallied around President George W. Bush after the attacks, passing the PATRIOT Act and supporting the War in Afghanistan.  In recent years, the war in Afghanistan, once viewed largely as a ""just war"", has lost popularity. As of the year 2011, more than 60% of Americans oppose the war. Department of Homeland Security. The United States government created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in response to the September 11 attacks. DHS is a cabinet-level department of the federal government of the United States charged with protecting the territory of the United States from terrorist attacks and responding to natural disasters. With approximately 184,000 employees, DHS is the third-largest cabinet department in the U.S. federal government, after the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Energy. Societal consequences. Suspicion. In the U.S., many activities of foreigners or American citizens, which, prior to 9/11, would be viewed innocently (or as just eccentric), are now viewed with suspicion, especially in regards to the behavior of anyone who looks ""Arab"" in terms of clothing or skin color. Six Muslim imams were removed from a U.S. airliner when they prayed before the flight and showed ""suspicious behavior"". Various government agencies and police forces in the U.S. have asked people to watch people around them and report ""unusual"" behavior, and signs posted in all public places request citizens to report anything out of the ordinary. The United States Department of Homeland Security has advised citizens to ""be vigilant, take notice of your surroundings, and report suspicious items or activities to local authorities immediately."" Discriminatory backlash. Since the September 11 attacks, Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South-Asian Americans – as well as those perceived to be members of these groups – have been victims of threats, vandalism and arson in the United States. Safety concerns. Some Americans, are afraid of traveling by plane and therefore they are instead traveled by car. This resulted in an estimated 1,595 additional highway deaths in the ensuing year. Following 9/11, helicopter parenting has increased due to parental concerns about children's safety. Censorship. Films and television programs produced before 2001 that feature the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center or events similar to 9/11 have been edited in re-airings on television. One such example is an episode of ""The Simpsons"", ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson,"" the main setting of which is the World Trade Center. After 9/11, Clear Channel Communications (an owner of over 1,000 radio stations in the U.S.) released a list of songs deemed ""inappropriate"". The songs were not banned outright, but stations were advised not to play them. The New York-based band Dream Theater released a live album titled ""Live Scenes from New York"" on September 11, 2001. The cover art depicted the Manhattan skyline, including the World Trade Center towers in flames. It was immediately recalled, and the artwork altered. Another New York-based band, The Strokes, originally had ""New York City Cops"" as the ninth track on their 2001 breakthrough debut album ""Is This It"". The album, initially released in June of that year in Australia, was released stateside on October 9, with ""New York City Cops"" removed and replaced with the newer ""When It Started"" as a result of the September 11 attacks.  In an act of self-censorship, American rock band Jimmy Eat World changed the title of their third album, ""Bleed American"", to a self-titled album, after the September 11 attacks.  British band Bush were forced to change the name of their single 'Speed Kills' to ""The People That We Love"". They also changed the original artwork for their album ""Golden State"" before it was released which originally depicted a picture of a plane in mid-air.  The music video for a song called 'Piece By Piece' by British band Feeder was also changed. The original video depicted animated characters of the band playing in a New York skyscraper with the world trade center in the background and planes flying near by. The band later jump from the window of the building. "

wikipedia-3997066," Henry Willson  Henry Willson (July 31, 1911 – November 2, 1978) was an American Hollywood talent agent who played a large role in popularizing the beefcake craze of the 1950s. He was known for his stable of young, attractive clients, including Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Chad Everett, Robert Wagner, Nick Adams, Guy Madison, Troy Donahue, Rory Calhoun, Clint Walker, Doug McClure, Ty Hardin, and John Derek. He discovered Rhonda Fleming walking to Beverly Hills High School, brought her to David O. Selznick's attention, and helped groom her for stardom, and was instrumental in advancing Lana Turner's career. Early life. Willson was born Henry Leroy Willson into a prominent show business family in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. His father Horace was the vice-president of the Columbia Phonograph Company and advanced to the presidency when the company was renamed in 1922 as the Columbia Gramophone Manufacturing Company. Willson came in close contact with many Broadway theatre, opera, and vaudeville performers, and Will Rogers, Fanny Brice, and Fred Stone numbered among the family friends once they moved to Forest Hills, an upscale neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. Concerned about his son's interest in tap dance, the elder Willson enrolled Henry in the Asheville School in North Carolina, where he hoped the school's many team sports and rugged weekend activities such as rock climbing and backpacking would have a positive influence on the boy. He later attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, spending weekends in Manhattan, where he wrote weekly gossip columns for ""Variety"". Hollywood years. In 1933, Willson migrated to Hollywood via a cruise ship through the Panama Canal. On board he cultivated a friendship with Bing Crosby's wife Dixie Lee, who introduced him to the Hollywood elite and secured him a job with ""Photoplay"", where his first article was about newborn Gary Crosby. He began writing for ""The Hollywood Reporter"" and ""The New Movie Magazine"", became a junior agent at the Joyce & Polimer Agency, moved into a Beverly Hills home purchased by his father, and became a regular at Sunset Strip gay bars, where he wooed young men for both professional and personal reasons. One of his first clients (and lovers) was Junior Durkin, whose career was cut short by an automobile accident on May 4, 1935, in which Durkin was killed.  Willson joined the Zeppo Marx Agency, where he represented newcomers Marjorie Bell, Jon Hall, and William T. Orr. He was introduced to Hollywood High School student Judy Turner in 1937, whom he renamed ""Lana Turner"" and got cast in small roles, finally introducing her to Mervyn LeRoy at Warner Brothers. In 1943, David O. Selznick hired Willson to head the talent division of his newly formed Vanguard Pictures. The first film he cast was the World War II drama ""Since You Went Away"" with Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones, and Shirley Temple. He placed Guy Madison, Craig Stevens, and John Derek (billed as Dare Harris) in small supporting roles. Willson eventually opened his own talent agency, where he nurtured the careers of his young finds, frequently coercing them into sexual relationships in exchange for publicity and film roles. In his book, ""Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall"" (2002), Richard Barrios writes, ""Talent agent Henry Willson... had a singular knack for discovering and renaming young actors whose visual appeal transcended any lack of ability. Under his tutelage, Robert Mosely became Guy Madison, Orison Whipple Hungerford Jr. was renamed Ty Hardin, Arthur Gelien was changed to Tab Hunter, and Roy Fitzgerald turned into Rock Hudson. So successful was the beefcake aspect of this enterprise, and so widely recognized was Willson's sexuality, that it was often, and often inaccurately, assumed that all of his clients were gay."" Suzanne Finstad confirms that ""Some of the would-be actors Willson represented were heterosexual, but a disproportionate number were homosexual, bisexual, or 'co-operated' with Willson 'to get gigs,' in the observation of Natalie 's costar Bobby Hyatt..."" ""If a young, handsome actor had Henry Willson for an agent, 'it was almost assumed he was gay, like it was written across his forehead,' recalls Ann Doran, one of Willson's few female clients."" His most prominent client was Rock Hudson, whom he transformed from a clumsy, naive, Chicago-born truck driver named Roy Scherer into one of Hollywood's most popular leading men. The two were teamed professionally until 1966. In 1955, ""Confidential"" magazine threatened to publish an expose about Hudson's secret homosexual life, and Willson disclosed information about Rory Calhoun's years in prison and Tab Hunter's arrest at a gay party in 1950 in exchange for the tabloid not printing the Hudson story. At his agent's urging, Hudson married Willson's secretary Phyllis Gates in order to put the rumors to rest and maintain a macho image, but the union dissolved after three years. Later years and death. In his later years, Willson struggled with drug addiction, alcoholism, paranoia, and weight problems. Because his own homosexuality had become public knowledge, many of his clients, both gay and straight, distanced themselves from him for fear of being branded the same. In 1974, the unemployed and destitute agent moved into the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, where he remained until he died of cirrhosis of the liver. With no money to cover the cost of a tombstone, he was interred in an unmarked grave, in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, in North Hollywood, California. "

wikipedia-3997123," Abu Musa Ashaari  Abu-Musa Abd-Allah ibn Qays al-Ash'ari, better known as Abu Musa al-Ashari () (d.ca. 662 or 672) was a companion of the prophet Muhammad and important figure in early Islamic history. He was at various times governor of Basra and Kufa and was involved in the early Muslim conquests of Persia. Life. Abu Musa came originally from Hadhramaut, region of Yemen, where his tribe, the Ashar, lived in the pre-Islamic period. He accepted Islam at Mecca prior to the ""hijra"" and returned to his native Yemen to propagate the faith. There was no news of him for more than a decade until following the conquest of Khaybar in 628 when he came to Muhammad in Medina with more than fifty converts from Yemen including his two brothers Abu Ruhm and Abu Burdah. Following the conquest of Mecca in 629, Abu Musa was named among those sent by Muhammad on the expedition to Awtas. Two years later he was appointed as one of the governors over Yemen, where he remained until the caliphate of Abu Bakr, whom he joined in fighting the local leader of the ""ridda"" (lit. apostasy) movement. After the Caliphate of Abu Bakr. The appointments of Abu Musa to the governorates of Basra and Kufa were made during the caliphates of Umar and Uthman, but the exact dates and circumstances are not clear. However, during the period that he was governor of one or the other of the two Muslim garrison towns in Iraq, Abu Musa is frequently mentioned in connection with the early Muslim conquest of the Sasanian Empire. In the Battle of Tostar (642) he distinguished himself as a military commander. The Persian commander, Hormuzan, had withdrawn his forces to the fortified city of Tostar. The Caliph Umar did not underestimate the strength of the enemy and he mobilized a force to confront Hormuzan. Among the Muslim forces were dedicated veterans like Ammar ibn Yasir, Al-Baraa ibn Malik al-Ansari and his brother Anas, Majra'a al-Bakri and Salamah ibn Rajaa. Umar appointed Abu Musa as commander of the army. Tostar was impossible to take by storm and several unsuccessful attempts were made to breach the walls. Fortunately, a Persian defector opened the city's gates from within making way for Abu Musa's army. When Basra was established during 'Umar's period, he started building some canals for conveying drinking water and for irrigation. Al-Tabari reports that 'Utba ibn Ghazwan built the first canal from the Tigris River to the site of Basra when the city was in the planning stage. After the city was built, 'Umar appointed Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as the first governor. Al-Ash'ari governed during the period 17-29/638-650. He began building two important canals linking Basra with the Tigris River. These were al-Ubulla River and the Ma'qil River. The two canals were the basis for the agricultural development for the whole Basra region and used for drinking water. 'Umar also devised the policy of cultivating barren lands by assigning such lands to those who undertook to cultivate them. This policy continued during the Umayyad period and it resulted in the cultivation of large areas of barren lands through the construction of irrigation canals by the state and by individuals. Following the Assassination of Uthman. There are many unresolved issues regarding the First Fitna (literally “trial”) period of dissension and civil war, which split the Muslim community following the assassination of the Caliph Uthman. When Ali arrived in Kufa in 656 seeking support against Aishah bint Abi Bakr and the Basrans it is agreed that Abu Musa (then the governor of Kufa), urged his subjects not to support Ali and avoid participation in the ""fitna"". When his advice was rejected and the people of Kufa supported Ali, Abu Musa was forced to leave and Ali disposed him from his governorate. However, the next year Abu Musa is named as the arbitrator (""hakam"") chosen by Ali’s party in accordance with the terms agreed between Ali and Muawiyah after the battle of Siffin. There are many historical versions of the result of the arbitration court. According to an academic research done by Khalid Kabir Alal in University of Algeria, the most authentic version is that both Abu Musa and 'Amr ibn al-'As, the arbitrator appointed by Muawiyah I, decided that Muawiyah will be deposed, and the fate of the murderers of Uthman will be decided by the remaining of The Ten Promised Paradise. After this Abu Musa died in Mecca and some say in Kufa. There are a number of different dates given for his death, the most common being 662 and 672. Contributions to Islamic Learning. Despite Abu Musa’s reputation as a soldier and politician, he was also praised for his beautiful recitation of the Qur'an, and he is associated with one of the early versions (""mashahef""), which was superseded by Uthman's recension. Some of the variants of Abu Musa's version have been preserved. He was also a respected faqih and was regarded among the leading judges in early Muslim history. People used to say: ""The judges in this ""ummah"" are four: Umar, Ali ibn Abi Talib, Abu Musa and Zayd ibn Thabit."" Abu Musa is also credited with narrating numerous hadith, as well as being the ancestor of the founder of the Ash'ari theological school within Islam, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d.935). Ahadith transmitted by him. Abu Musa al-Ashari reported that the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عايه و سلم) said, ""When a son of a servant of Allah dies, Allah Says to the angels, 'Have you taken the son of My servant?' They say, 'Yes.' Then Allah Says, 'Have you taken the fruit of his heart?' They say, 'Yes.' Allah Says, ""What has My servant said?' They say, 'He has praised You and said, Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (To Allah we belong and to Him is our return). Then Allah Says, 'Build a house for My servant in Paradise and call it the house of praise.' From Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad and ibn Habban "

The band has enjoyed a rebirth in large part to the popular use of ""The Boys Are Back In Town"" in various television sports programming. The track has served as the theme for the NBA and Fox Sports Network's coverage of Major League Baseball. In addition, their song ""Did You See Me,"" was used to promote the NFL Re-Play series on the NFL Network in 2006 and 2007. After several years out of the limelight, The BusBoys made an appearance on ABC TV during the Capital One Bowl on New Years Day 2005 under their new name, ""Brian O'Neal and The BusBoys."" And in early 2006, they began releasing tracks from their new music project, ""Sex, Love and Rock & Roll"", via digital download. The full album was to be released in CD form in late 2007. In July 2007, the band announced on its web site that they were at work on a documentary film, ""The Story of Brian O'Neal and The BusBoys"", directed by Ruth Robinson. "
wikipedia-3997177," Water aeration  Water aeration is the process of increasing the oxygen saturation of the water. Water quality. Water aeration is often required in water bodies that suffer from anoxic conditions, usually caused by adjacent human activities such as sewage discharges, agricultural run-off, or over-baiting a fishing lake. Aeration can be achieved through the infusion of air into the bottom of the lake, lagoon or pond or by surface agitation from a fountain or spray-like device to allow for oxygen exchange at the surface and the release of noxious gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane or hydrogen sulfide. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major contributor to water quality. Not only do fish and other aquatic animals need it, but oxygen breathing aerobic bacteria decompose organic matter. When oxygen concentrations become low, anoxic conditions may develop which can decrease the ability of the water body to support life. Aeration methods. Any procedure by which oxygen is added to water can be considered a type of water aeration. This being the only criterion, there are a variety of ways to aerate water. These fall into two broad areas – surface aeration and subsurface aeration. There are a number of techniques and technologies available for both approaches Natural aeration. Natural aeration is a type of both sub-surface and surface aeration. It can occur through sub-surface aquatic plants. Through the natural process of photosynthesis, water plants release oxygen into the water providing it with the oxygen necessary for fish to live and aerobic bacteria to break down excess nutrients. Oxygen can be driven into the water when the wind disturbs the surface of the water body and natural aeration can occur through a movement of water caused by an incoming stream, waterfall, or even a strong flood. In large water bodies, autumn turn-over can introduce oxygen rich water into the oxygen poor Hypolimnion. Surface aeration. Fountains. Fountains aerate by pulling water from the surface of the water (usually the first 1–2 feet) and propelling it into the air. Some fountains incorporate the use of a draft tube, which extends deeper and is able to pull water from approximately six feet below the surface, so as to achieve more water circulation.  A fountain consists of a motor that powers a rotating impeller. The impeller pumps water from the first few feet of the water and expels it into the air. This process utilizes air-water contact to transfer oxygen. As the water is propelled into the air, it breaks into small droplets. Collectively, these small droplets have a large surface area through which oxygen can be transferred. Upon return, these droplets mix with the rest of the water and thus transfer their oxygen back to the ecosystem. Fountains are a popular method of surface aerators because of the aesthetic appearance that they offer. However, most fountains are unable to produce a large area of oxygenated water. Also, running electricity through the water to the fountain can be a safety hazard. Floating surface aerators. Floating surface aerators work in a similar manner to fountains, but they do not offer the same aesthetic appearance. They extract water from the first 1–2 feet of the water body and utilize air-water contact to transfer oxygen. Instead of propelling water into the air, they disrupt the water at the water surface. Floating surface aerators are also powered by on-shore electricity. Surface aerators are limited to a small area as they are unable to add circulation or oxygen to much more than a 3 metre radius. This circulation and oxygenating is then limited to the first portion of the water column, often leaving the bottom portions unaffected. Paddlewheel aerators. Paddlewheel aerators also utilize air-to-water contact to transfer oxygen from the air in the atmosphere to the water body. They are most often used in the aquaculture (rearing aquatic animals or cultivating aquatic plants for food) field. Constructed of a hub with attached paddles, these aerators are usually powered by a tractor power take-off (PTO), a gas engine, or an electric motor. They tend to be mounted on floats. Electricity forces the paddles to turn, churning the water and allowing oxygen transfer through air-water contact. As each new section of water is churned, it absorbs oxygen from the air and then upon its return to the water, restores it to the water. In this regard paddlewheel aeration works very similarly to floating surface aerators. Subsurface aeration. Subsurface aeration seeks to release bubbles at the bottom of the water body and allow them to rise by the force of gravity. ""Diffused aeration systems"" utilize bubbles to aerate as well as mix the water. Water displacement from the expulsion of bubbles can cause a mixing action to occur, and the contact between the water and the bubble will result in an oxygen transfer. Jet aeration. Subsurface aeration can be accomplished by the use of jet aerators, which aspirate air, by means of the Venturi principle, and inject the air into the liquid. Coarse bubble aeration. Coarse bubble aeration is a type of subsurface aeration wherein air is pumped from an on-shore air compressor. through a hose to a unit placed at the bottom of the water body. The unit expels ""coarse bubbles"" (more than 2mm in diameter), which release oxygen when they come into contact with the water, which also contributes to a mixing of the lake#s stratified layers. With the release of large bubbles from the system, a turbulent displacement of water occurs which results in a mixing of the water. In comparison to other aeration techniques, coarse bubble aeration is very inefficient in the way of transferring oxygen. This is due to the large diameter and relatively small collective surface area of its bubbles Fine bubble aeration. Fine bubble aeration is an efficient way to transfer oxygen to a water body. A compressor on shore pumps air through a hose, which is connected to an underwater aeration unit. Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These diffusers come in the shape of discs, plates, tubes or hoses constructed from glass-bonded silica, porous ceramic plastic, PVC or perforated membranes made from EPDM (ethylene propylene diene Monomer) rubber. Air pumped through the diffuser membranes is released into the water. These bubbles are known as ""fine bubbles"". The EPA defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter. This type of aeration has a very high oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), sometimes as high as 15 pounds of oxygen / (horsepower * hour) (9.1 kilograms of oxygen / (kilowatt * hour)). On average, diffused air aeration diffuses approximately 2–4 cfm (cubic feet of air per minute) (56.6-113.3 liters of air per minute), but some operate at levels as low as 1 cfm (28.3 L/min) or as high as 10 cfm (283 L/min). Fine bubble diffused aeration is able to maximize the surface area of the bubbles and thus transfer more oxygen to the water per bubble. Additionally, smaller bubbles take more time to reach the surface so not only is the surface area maximized but so are the number of seconds each bubble spends in the water, allowing it more time to transfer oxygen to the water. As a general rule, smaller bubbles and a deeper release point will generate a greater oxygen transfer rate. However, almost all of the oxygen dissolved into the water from an air bubble occurs when the bubble is being formed. Only a negligible amount occurs during the bubbles transit to the surface of the water. This is why an aeration process that makes many small bubbles is better than one that makes fewer larger ones. The breaking up of larger bubbles into smaller ones also repeats this formation and transfer process. One of the drawbacks to fine bubble aeration is that the membranes of ceramic diffusers can sometimes clog and must be cleaned in order to keep them working at their optimum efficiency. Also, they do not possess the ability to mix as well as other aeration techniques, such as coarse bubble aeration. Lake destratification. Circulators are commonly used to mix a pond or lake and thus reduce thermal stratification. Once circulated water reaches the surface, the air-water interface facilitates the transfer of oxygen to the lake water. Natural resource and environmental managers have long been challenged by problems caused by thermal stratification of lakes. Fish die-offs have been directly associated with thermal gradients, stagnation, and ice cover. Excessive growth of plankton may limit the recreational use of lakes and the commercial use of lake water. With severe thermal stratification in a lake, the quality of drinking water also can be adversely affected. For fisheries managers, the spatial distribution of fish within a lake is often adversely affected by thermal stratification and in some cases may indirectly cause large die-offs of recreationally important fish. One commonly used tool to reduce the severity of these lake management problems is to eliminate or lesson thermal stratification through aeration. Many types of aeration equipment have been used to reduce or eliminate thermal stratification. Aeration has met with some success, although it has rarely proved to be a panacea. Oxygenation barges. During heavy rain, London's sewage storm pipes overflow into the River Thames, sending dissolved oxygen levels plummeting and threatening the species it supports. Two dedicated McTay Marine vessels, oxygenation barges ""Thames Bubbler"" and ""Thames Vitality"" are used to replenish oxygen levels, as part of an ongoing battle to clean up the river, which now supports 115 species of fish and hundreds more invertebrates, plants and birds. The dissolved oxygen concentration within Cardiff Bay are maintained at or above 5 mg/L. Compressed air is pumped, from five sites around the Bay, through a series of steel reinforced rubber pipelines, laid on the beds of the Bay and Rivers Taff and Ely. These are connected to approximately 800 diffusers. At times this is insufficient and the Harbour Authority is using a mobile oxygenation barge built by McTay Marine with liquid oxygen stored in a tank. Liquid oxygen is passed through an electrically heated vapouriser and the gas is injected into a stream of water which is pumped from, and returned to, the bay. The barge is capable of dissolving up to 5 tonnes of oxygen in 24 hours. "
wikipedia-3997192," Maylene and the Sons of Disaster  Maylene and the Sons of Disaster is an American, Southern heavy metal band formed in 2004 in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2005, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster signed to Mono Vs Stereo and released their self-titled debut album. The band name and concept are based on the legend of the criminal gang of Ma Barker and her sons, noting that evil lifestyles will be met with divine justice. History. Earlier years and ""II"" (2004-2009). In April 2006 it was announced that the band had signed to Ferret Records. In August of that year, the group hinted they would be working on their Ferret Records debut in October with an expected release date of early 2007. Vocalist Dallas Taylor (formerly of Underoath) updated fans once again in January 2007 and said they would be releasing an EP called ""The Day Hell Broke Loose at Sicard Hollow"", followed by their full length album, ""II"". Maylene and the Sons of Disaster's ""II"" was released on Ferret Records on March 20, 2007 nationwide. Maylene appeared on the cover of the March/April 2007 issue of ""HM Magazine"". Throughout April 2007, the band went on tour in support of their new album ""II"" with Christian metalcore band Haste the Day. Other bands on tour included From Autumn to Ashes, The Sleeping, and Alesana. In May, the band was featured on the ""Dirty South Tour"" with Underoath, Norma Jean, and The Glass Ocean. Notably, this is the first time vocalist Dallas Taylor toured with his old band since he was asked to leave in 2003. Other bands touring with them with similar southern music styles are He Is Legend and Hey You Party Animals. In an interview, Dallas Taylor said: ""What has always struck me about the Ma Barker story is how much it symbolizes the idea of 'what goes around, comes around.' Divine justice is unavoidable. When I was a kid, I would see re-enactments of the Barker shooting in Ocala every year with my Grandpa, and it was as if Ma Barker and her sons were still screaming their story to anyone who would listen. Maylene and the Sons of Disaster is made up of five dudes who play the role of the Barker sons, and in these songs we speak as though we were them, telling any who would listen that a life lived unjustly will meet divine justice on the other side. We also wanted to think of the most crazy backwoods theme possible for this band. Since Ma was backwoods, and we are backwoods, this is the way it had to be."" When asked if they play Christian music, Taylor admits that ""For us our faith is what makes us. We believe in showing our fans respect and kindness. I love it when bands minister, as long as their lifestyle off the stage lives up to their life on stage. Nowadays it is kinda cliche in some markets to be a Christian band but being that in itself is hard and sometimes can put a bull's eye on your back. It is not an easy thing sometimes, but no one is perfect. But living to the standards of what you preach and talk about is a big deal and something we chose to do everyday."" Taylor has also been quoted as saying that he is tired of bands that try to play off their Christian background or message to sell records or to perpetuate their popularity and stated: ""I want every kid to know I am not going to change who I really am to sell records. I mean, I absolutely hate shoving things down people's throats, but hiding who you are is just as bad."" ""III"" (2009-2011). From September to November 2008 they headlined a full U.S. tour with support from A Static Lullaby, Showbread, Confide, and Attack Attack! before beginning to record their third album, ""III"". Half of the members recording this album were in Underoath during their early days. Their third album, entitled ""III"" was released on June 23, 2009. The song ""Just a Shock"" was released to the band's Myspace page on May 11, 2009. ""III"" debuted at No. 71 on the Billboard 200. From September 2009-February 2010, Dallas took some time off from touring to deal with some things in his personal life. With the band not wanting to miss any tour dates, they recruited their good friend Schuylar Croom,vocalist for He Is Legend, to fill in for Dallas. During these tours, no original members of the band were present onstage, as Roman had recently left the band and Dallas is the only original member remaining in the bands lineup. Starting July 16, the band will be heading out on the Thee Summer Bailout Tour with Emery, Closure In Moscow, and Kiros on all dates, and Ivoryline and Secret & Whisper on select dates. They performed the entrance theme for the former Unified WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho and The Big Show, entitled ""Crank the Walls Down"". Their song ""Step Up (I'm On It)"" was also the theme for WWE Bragging Rights. The band will be on the Taste of Chaos Tour in Europe at the end of 2009. On Monday, December 7, 2009, while in route to a show in Wiesbaden, Germany for the Taste of Chaos tour, Maylene was involved in an accident resulting in mild damage to the band's tour bus. According to guitarist Kelly Nunn's personal Facebook page, the bus collided with a car, a gas tanker and a guard rail. The band was not injured, but missed their performance time. The band did, however, appear at the merchandise booths later in the day. During the spring of 2010 they will be the supporting act with Saosin, and later Story of the Year. In the summer, they will be headlining Scream The Prayer, along with For Today. IV (2011-Present). Maylene released their fourth album on September 27, 2011. The band's first single ""In Dead We Dream"" was released online before the album release date.  Maylene's official Twitter said on March 2 ""There is no way to describe this record. Be ready to have your minds open to the best Maylene yet."" The album is again on Ferret Records and was produced by Brian Virtue and Rob Graves. Dallas was quoted saying ""We are so excited about this new record… it will be by far our best yet. We couldn't ask for a better group of people on board making this record happen."" Videography.

wikipedia-3997211," Super 8 film cameras  A Super 8mm camera is a motion picture camera specifically manufactured to utilise the Super 8mm motion picture format. Super 8mm film cameras were first manufactured in 1965 by Kodak for their newly introduced amateur film format, which replaced the Standard 8 mm film format. Manufacture continued until the popularity of video cameras in the early 1980s. The cameras are no longer professionally manufactured (although used cameras may be restored and sold) and most cameras readily available are used from the 1960s and 1970s. Super 8mm Cameras. The first camera to be formatted for the new film was the Kodak M2. During the late 1960s cameras were only formatted to film at 18 frames per second, but as technology improved, Frame speeds such as 24 frame/s (The motion picture standard) and faster speeds (for slow motion filming) were incorporated into camera mechanics. Super 8mm film stock. Super 8mm film cameras do not need to use the Super 8mm film produced by Kodak, but other film stocks produced by companies such as Fujifilm and independents (in the form of re-packaged film) are compatible. The only difference to the films is the cartridge used to insert them into the camera. All lengths of film sold are of lengths. Kodak did produce and sound cartridges, but these have since been discontinued. Most stocks are reversal film (for simple projection) but some negative stocks have been produced.  In 1965, the original emulsion released was ""Kodachrome"" II colour film. However in 2005, Kodak announced it would stop manufacturing Kodachrome stock. The discontinuation was due to the steps K-14 development used. Nowadays, Kodak Super 8mm film cartridges are sold as either ""Ektachrome"" colour reversal film,""Tri-X"" black and white reversal film or Vision 3 colour negative film (in 200 ISO and 500 ISO speeds). Fuji Velvia 50 and a number of other stocks are also available. Super 8mm brands. Many companies manufactured cameras and equipment for use with the format.

wikipedia-3997452," RIAA equalization  RIAA equalization is a specification for the recording and playback of phonograph records, established by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The purposes of the equalization are to permit greater recording times, improve sound quality, and to reduce the groove damage that would otherwise arise during playback.  The RIAA equalization curve was intended to operate as a de facto global industry standard for records since 1954. However, it is almost impossible to say when the change actually took place.  Before then, especially from 1940, each record company applied its own equalization; there were over 100 combinations of turnover and rolloff frequencies in use, the main ones being Columbia-78, Decca-U.S., European (various), Victor-78 (various), Associated, BBC, NAB, Orthacoustic, World, Columbia LP, FFRR-78 and microgroove, and AES. The RIAA curve. RIAA equalization is a form of pre-emphasis on recording and de-emphasis on playback. A recording is made with the low frequencies reduced and the high frequencies boosted, and on playback the opposite occurs. The net result is a flat frequency response, but with attenuation of high frequency noise such as hiss and clicks that arise from the recording medium. Reducing the low frequencies also limits the excursions the cutter needs to make when cutting a groove. Groove width is thus reduced, allowing more grooves to fit into a given surface area, permitting longer recording times. This also reduces physical stresses on the stylus which might otherwise cause distortion or groove damage during playback.  A potential drawback of the system is that rumble from the playback turntable's drive mechanism is amplified by the low frequency boost that occurs on playback.  Players must therefore be designed to limit rumble, more so than if RIAA equalization did not occur.  RIAA equalization is not a simple low-pass filter. It defines transition points in three places: 75 µs, 318 µs and 3180 µs, which correspond to 2122 Hz, 500 Hz and 50 Hz.  Implementing this characteristic is not especially difficult, but is more involved than a simple amplifier.  In the past almost all hi-fi preamplifiers, integrated amplifiers, and receivers had a built-in phono preamplifier with the RIAA characteristic, but it is often omitted in modern designs, due to the gradual obsolescence of vinyl records. Add-on phono preamplifiers with the RIAA equalization curve are available; these adapt a magnetic phono cartridge to an unbalanced −10 dB consumer line-level RCA input. Some modern turntables feature built-in preamplification to the RIAA standard. Special preamplifiers are also available for the various equalization curves used on pre-1954 records. Digital audio editors often feature the ability to equalize audio samples using standard and custom equalization curves, removing the need for a dedicated hardware preamplifier when capturing audio with a computer. However, this can add an extra step in processing a sample, and may amplify audio quality deficiencies of the sound card being used to capture the signal. History. Origins of pre-emphasis. Equalization practice for electrical recordings dates to the beginning of the art. In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the Western Electric ""rubber line"" magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place, with the cutter into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form. West in 1930 and later P. G. H. Voight (1940) showed that the early Wente-style condenser microphones contributed to a 4 to 6 dB midrange brilliance or pre-emphasis in the recording chain. This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company had a higher amplitude in the midrange region. Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis above 1,000 Hz in 78 and 33 rpm records, some 29 years before the RIAA curve. Over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard. For example, in Europe, for many years recordings required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250 to 300 Hz and a treble rolloff at 10,000 Hz ranging from 0 to −5 dB, or more. In the United States there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies, such as 500 Hz, as well as a greater treble rolloff like −8.5 dB, and more. The purpose was to record higher modulation levels on the record. Standardization. Evidence from the early technical literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it was not until the 1942–1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry. Before this time, electrical recording technology from company to company was considered a proprietary art all the way back to the 1925 Western Electric licensed method first used by Columbia and Victor. For example, what Brunswick-Balke-Collender (Brunswick Corporation) did was different from the practices of Victor. Broadcasters were faced with having to adapt daily to the varied recording characteristics of many sources: various makers of ""home recordings"" readily available to the public, European recordings, lateral cut transcriptions, and vertical cut transcriptions. Efforts were started in 1942 to standardize within the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), later known as the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB). The NAB, among other items, issued recording standards in 1949 for laterally and vertically cut records, principally transcriptions. A number of 78 rpm record producers as well as early LP makers also cut their records to the NAB/NARTB lateral standard. The lateral cut NAB curve was remarkably similar to the NBC Orthacoustic curve which evolved from practices within the National Broadcasting Company since the mid-1930s. Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100 Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000 Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16 dB at 10,000 Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer/aluminum, and vinyl disc media. When the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve (de-emphasis), signal to noise ratio was improved and the programming sounded more lifelike. In a related area, around 1940 treble pre-emphasis similar to that used in the NBC Orthacoustic recording curve was first employed by Edwin Howard Armstrong in his system of Frequency Modulation (FM) radio broadcasting. FM radio receivers using Armstrong circuits and treble de-emphasis would render high quality wide-range audio output with low noise levels. When the Columbia LP was released in June 1948, the developers subsequently published technical information about the 33 rpm, microgroove, long playing record. Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing that it was like the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or pre-emphasis below 150 Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. This was the first such curve based on formulae. In 1951 at the beginning of the post-World War II high fidelity (hi-fi) popularity, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) developed a standard playback curve. This was intended for use by hi-fi amplifier manufacturers. If records were engineered to sound good on hi-fi amplifiers using the AES curve, this would be a worthy goal towards standardization. This curve was defined by the time constants of audio filters and had poles at 17 Hz and 2.2 kHz, and a zero at 400 Hz. RCA Victor and Columbia were in a ""market war"" concerning which recorded format was going to win: the Columbia LP versus the RCA Victor 45 rpm disc (released in February 1949). Besides also being a battle of disc size and record speed, there was a technical difference in the recording characteristics. RCA Victor was using ""New Orthophonic"" whereas Columbia was using the LP curve. Ultimately the New Orthophonic curve was disclosed in a publication by R. C. Moyer of RCA Victor in 1953. He traced RCA Victor characteristics back to the Western Electric ""rubber line"" recorder in 1925 up to the early 1950s laying claim to long-held recording practices and reasons for major changes in the intervening years. The RCA Victor New Orthophonic curve was within the tolerances for the NAB/NARTB, Columbia LP, and AES curves. It eventually became the technical predecessor to the RIAA curve. Between 1953 and 1956 (before the stereo LP in 1958) several standards bodies around the world adopted the same playback curve -identical to the RCA Victor New Orthophonic curve- which became standard throughout the national and international record markets. However, although these standards were all identical, no universal name was used. One of the standard was called simply ""RIAA"", and it is likely that this name was eventually adopted because it was memorable.  It is possible that some niche record cutters were still using EQ curves other than the RIAA well into the 1970s. As a result, some audio manufacturers today produce Phono Equalizers with selectable EQ curves, including options for Columbia, Decca, CCIR, and TELDEC's Direct Metal Mastering. The Enhanced RIAA curve. The official RIAA standard defines three time-constants with pre-emphasis rising indefinitely above 75 µs, but in practice this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and cutting lathe imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the pre-emphasis characteristic, so no official upper limit was included in the RIAA definition. Modern systems have far wider potential bandwidth. An essential feature of all cutting lathes—including the Neumann cutting lathes—is a forcibly imposed high frequency roll-off above the audio band (>20 kHz). This implies two or more additional time constants to those defined by the RIAA curve. This is not standardized anywhere, but set by the maker of the cutting lathe and associated electronics.  The so-called ""Enhanced RIAA"" curve or ""eRIAA"" curve attempts to provide complementary correction for these unofficial time constants upon playback. Background. In 1995 one non-academic source erroneously suggested that Neumann cutting lathes applied a single high-frequency pole at 3.18 µs (50 kHz) and that a complementary zero should therefore be included upon playback, presumably to preserve correct phase response. However, no such pole exists. The popular Neumann SAL 74B lathe applies a first-order roll off at 49.9 kHz, implemented by a second-order Butterworth (maximally flat) active filter, plus an additional pole at 482 kHz. This cannot be compensated for by a simple zero, and in any case, other lathes may differ. Nevertheless, the use of the erroneous zero remains a subject of some debate among amateur enthusiasts. It is worth noting that many common phono preamplifier designs using negative feedback equalisation include an unintentional zero at high frequencies, similar to that proposed by Wright. This was illustrated, for example, in the seminal 1980 work on RIAA Playback Equalisation by Lipshitz/Jung, though it was noted as unwanted.  Some phono preamplifiers include additional circuitry to correct this and ensure that the output follows the RIAA curve accurately. In most, however, this is omitted. IEC RIAA curve. In 1972 an alternative version of the replay curve (but not the recording curve) was proposed by the International Electrotechnical Commission, differing from the RIAA replay curve only in the addition of a pole at 7950 µs (20 Hz). The justification was to reduce the subsonic output of the phono amplifier caused by disk warp and turntable rumble.  This so-called IEC amendment to the RIAA curve is not universally seen as desirable, as it introduces considerable amplitude and -more importantly- phase errors into the low frequency response during playback. The simple first-order roll-off also provides only very mild reduction of rumble, and many manufacturers consider that turntables, arm and cartridge combinations should be of sufficient quality for problems not to arise. Some manufacturers follow the IEC standard, others do not, while the remainder make this IEC-RIAA option user selectable. It remains subject to debate some 35 years later. TELDEC/DIN Curve. Telefunken and Decca founded a record company (Teldec) that used a characteristic proposed for German DIN-Standard on July 1957: DIN45533, DIN45536, DIN45537. It is similar, but not identical, to the RIAA. The extent of usage of this curve is unclear. Time constants: 3180 µs (50 Hz), 318 µs (500 Hz), and 50 µs (3,180 Hz). Compare to RIAA time constants 3180 µs (50 Hz), 318 µs (500 Hz), and 75 µs (2,120 Hz). "

wikipedia-2336309," A Bushel and a Peck  ""A Bushel and a Peck"" is a popular song written by Frank Loesser and published in 1950. The song was introduced in the Broadway musical ""Guys and Dolls"", which opened at the 46th Street Theater on November 24, 1950. It was performed on stage by Vivian Blaine, who later reprised her role as Miss Adelaide in the 1955 film version of the play. ""A Bushel and a Peck,"" however, was not included in the film. A recording by Perry Como and Betty Hutton (made on September 12, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 47-3930) first reached the Billboard magazine charts on October 27, 1950 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at #6. Another contemporary recording that had some popularity was by Margaret Whiting and Jimmy Wakely (recorded on September 13, 1950 and released by Capitol Records as catalog number 1234). The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on October 20, 1950 and lasted 13 weeks on the chart, peaking at #13.  Doris Day's recording (made on September 13, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as 78rpm catalog number 39008 and 45rpm catalog number 6-838) made the chart on January 5, 1951 at #30 for one week. Many other recording artists also did versions of the song.  On Cash Box magazine's Best-Selling Record charts, where all versions of the song are combined, the song reached #5 on December 2, 1950. The song gained so much popularity before the musical actually began that it was moved from its original spot opening the second act into the first act. The number, in context of the show, can be performed either as ""Miss Adelaide and her Chick Chick Chickedies,"" where the girls are dressed in yellow feathers, or as ""Miss Adelaide and the Hot Box Farmerettes,"" where skimpy plantation outfits are worn (often jean cutoffs and checkered racing shirts or short gingham sundresses).

wikipedia-2336317," Intelligence cycle  The traditional Intelligence cycle is the fundamental cycle of intelligence processing in a civilian or military intelligence agency or in law enforcement as a closed path consisting of repeating nodes. The stages of the intelligence cycle include the issuance of requirements by decision makers, collection, processing, analysis, and publication of intelligence. The circuit is completed when decision makers provide feedback and revised requirements. The intelligence cycle is also called the Intelligence Process by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the uniformed services.  Conceptual model. Direction. Intelligence requirements are determined by a decision maker to meet his/her objectives. In the Federal government of the United States, requirements can be issued from the White House or the Congress. In NATO, a commander uses requirements (sometimes called 'Essential Elements of Intelligence (EEIs)) to initiate the intelligence cycle. Collection. In response to requirements, an intelligence staff develops an intelligence collection plan applying available sources and methods and seeking intelligence from other agencies. Depending on the organization and its access, sources may include HUMINT (human intelligence), IMINT (imagery intelligence), ELINT (electronic intelligence), SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), OSINT (open source, or publicly available intelligence), etc. Processing. Once the collection plan is executed and information arrives, it is processed for exploitation. This involves the translation of raw intelligence materials from a foreign language, evaluation of relevance and reliability, and collation of the raw intelligence in preparation for exploitation.  Analysis. Analysis establishes the significance and implications of processed intelligence, integrates it by combining disparate pieces of information to identify collateral information and patterns, then interprets the significance of any newly developed knowledge. Dissemination. Finished intelligence products take many forms depending on the needs of the decision maker and reporting requirements. The level of urgency of various types of intelligence is typically established by an intelligence organization or community. An indications and warning (I&W) bulletin would require higher precedence than an annual report, for example. Feedback. The intelligence cycle is a closed loop; feedback is received from the decision maker and revised requirements issued. "

wikipedia-2336330," Diaphragm seal  A diaphragm seal is a flexible membrane that seals and isolates an enclosure. The flexible nature of this seal allows pressure effects to cross the barrier but not the material being contained. Common uses for diaphragm seals are to protect pressure sensors from the fluid whose pressure is being measured. Materials. Since diaphragm seals need to be highly flexible, elastomers are commonly used, and include a wide variety of both general purpose and speciality rubbers. Elastomers are limited to low pressure applications and those that are chemically compatible with the various plastics and rubbers used. Metal diaphragms of stainless steel (several grades), Carpenter 20, Hastelloy, Monel, Inconel, tantalum, titanium and several other metals are in common use where high pressure ratings and specific chemical compatibility are required. Flanged assemblies or flush welded versions are available. Applications. Diaphragm seals (also known as chemical seals or gauge guards) are also used to protect a process fluid from the pressure sensor. Examples of this use are: Seal Failure. Diaphragm seals are susceptible to failure via several mechanisms, including cracking. Ozone cracking can occur in many elastomers for example used in pneumatic systems. If the gas contaminates the air supply, then many rubber diaphragms are at risk from the problem. "

wikipedia-2336367," Amédé Ardoin  Amédé Ardoin (March 11, 1898 – November 3, 1942) was a Louisiana Creole musician, known for his high singing voice and virtuosity on the Creole/Cajun Accordion. He is credited by Louisiana music scholars with laying the groundwork for Cajun music in the early 20th century.  Ardoin, with fiddle player Dennis McGee, was one of the first artists to record the music of the Acadiana region of Louisiana. On December 9, 1929, he and McGee recorded six songs for Columbia Records in New Orleans. In all, thirty-four recordings with Ardoin playing accordion are known to exist.  Life and career. The date and place of his death is uncertain. Descendants of family members and musicians who knew Ardoin tell a story, now well-known, about a racially motivated attack on him in which he was severely beaten, probably between 1939 – 1940, while walking home after playing at a house dance near Eunice, Louisiana. The most common story says that some white men were angered when a white woman, daughter of the house, lent her handkerchief to Ardoin to wipe the sweat from his face. Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge, in PBS's ""American Patchwork"", explained that after Ardoin left the place, he was run over by a Model A car and crushed his head and throat, damaging his vocal cords. He was found the next day, lying in a ditch. According to Canray, he ""went plumb crazy"" and ""didn't know if he was hungry or not. Others had to feed him. He got weaker and weaker until he died."" Others consider the story apocryphal. Other versions say that Ardoin was poisoned, not beaten, possibly by a jealous fellow musician.  Contemporaries said that Ardoin suffered from impaired mental and musical capacities later in his life, probably from that infamous night. He ended up in an asylum in Pineville, Louisiana, where he was admitted in September 1942. He died at the hospital two months later, and was buried in the hospital's common grave.  "

wikipedia-2336395," Earth X  Earth X is a 1999 comic book limited series written by Jim Krueger with art by John Paul Leon and published by Marvel Comics. Based on Alex Ross' notes, the series features a dystopian future version of the Marvel Universe. The series was followed by two sequels, Universe X and Paradise X. The universe of ""Earth X"" is designated as Earth-9997. History. ""Earth X"" began in 1997 when, in the wake of DC Comics' ""Kingdom Come"" miniseries (created by Alex Ross and Mark Waid), ""Wizard Magazine"" asked Ross likewise to imagine a possible dystopian future for Marvel. Ross sketched out some ideas of what some of the most well-known Marvel characters (including Spider-Man, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk) might be like in a future where all ordinary humans had gained superpowers, and what would become of the heroes who had once been set apart by abilities which were now commonplace. The issue of ""Wizard"" which contained the Ross article (accompanied by his characteristic illustrations) sold out rapidly, and demand was so extensive that in 1999 (in affiliation with Marvel), they republished the article as a separate booklet, the ""Earth X Sketchbook"", which likewise sold out. Taking this as a clear indicator of fan interest, Marvel commissioned Ross to create a full series based on his notes. Plot summary. Earth X is one of a number of planets implanted with a gestating Celestial egg, and the histories of many of its inhabitants vary wildly from their Marvel Universe counterparts. About ten years after the end of the heroic age, Black Bolt secretly releases the mutagenic Terrigen Mists into Earth's atmosphere, seeking to transform humanity into Inhumans so that his people will not suffer persecution. He has already blinded Uatu the Watcher to prevent the lunar-dwelling alien from witnessing his actions. As the Terrigen Mists become a permanent component of Earth's polluted atmosphere, Black Bolt and the Inhuman Royal Family leave Earth. Unable to operate his observation equipment, Uatu transports X-51 (Machine Man)—who has long since given up super-heroics to imitate the life of his human creator—to the Moon to act as Earth's new Watcher. He further removes Machine Man's human disguise and gives him a transparent body in an attempt to remove him emotionally and physically from the human race to prepare him for his role as a new Watcher. During the course of the story, X-51 gets increasingly annoyed at Uatu's assurance of the heroes' defeat. After finally killing the Red Skull, Captain America quits the Avengers, considering himself unfit for the team. Shortly afterward, Reed Richards constructs a worldwide network of vibranium power centers to solve the looming energy crisis, but the experiment fails when one of Reed's scientists falls into the reactor, causing a worldwide explosive chain reaction. The Terrigen Mists begin mutating Earth's human population, though much of the world blames ""Plague X"" on Richards' failed experiment. Benny Beckley, the young son of Comet Man, gains the ability to control the actions of others and becomes known as the Skull. Nearly all of the world's telepaths are killed by the backlash caused by Beckley's power manifestation. Sentinel City in the Savage Land serves as a safe haven for mutants. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom and Namor the Sub-Mariner attack the United Nations, where they fight the Fantastic Four. Doom is killed in an explosion along with Susan Richards. Namor kills Johnny Storm. Franklin Richards responds by cursing Namor, causing one side of his body to burst into flame upon contact with air, forcing Namor back into the ocean. A distraught Reed Richards dons Doom's armor and exiles himself to Castle Doom in Latveria, while Ben Grimm marries Alicia Masters and sires two sons, Buzz and Chuck. Soon after, the Absorbing Man absorbs the properties of Ultron, gaining a new synthetic intellect that enables him to transform into any substance at will. He attacks Washington, D.C., where he battles the Avengers. The Vision ultimately defeats the Absorbing Man by using a computer virus. Attempting to isolate the virus by turning into stone, the Absorbing Man is shattered by the Vision. During the battle, however, several Avengers are killed and Washington, D.C. is destroyed. Lord Sunfire: Emperor of Japan forms a secret pact of superheroes, entrusting each with a piece of the shattered Absorbing Man so that he can never be reassembled. In the aftermath of Washington's destruction and the subsequent decline of industry, Osborn Industries becomes the dominant U.S. business, controlling the USA's food supply. Norman Osborn, whose mutation makes his face and head resemble his old Green Goblin mask, is thus able to assume the Presidency of the United States without an election. To secure his political power, Osborn uses alien DNA to create the Hydra—a parasite collective that mind-controls its host bodies—and grants Tony Stark (one of the last unmutated humans) political asylum in exchange for constructing robotic replicas of the fallen Avengers to battle the Hydra menace. Under Czar Colossus (aka the Iron Czar), Russia becomes the world's predominant food producer while Great Britain (ruled by King Britain) uses its navy to distribute Russia's surplus grains around the world. The Black Panther (now a man-panther hybrid) rules Wakanda (a refuge for the mutated Ani-Men) as king alongside his wife, Queen Storm. Captain America and his partner Redwing learn that the Skull is gathering a mind-controlled army. After Redwing is overcome by the Skull's powers, Captain America retreats and joins forces with the circus performer Daredevil, who, as a result of Plague X, can recover from any injury. The duo travel the world, recruiting allies to fight the Skull. Meanwhile, the Inhuman Royal Family return from space and contact Reed Richards, hoping to reunite with their people. While trying to find the lost Inhuman nation with Cerebro, Richards discovers the true cause behind the mutation of Earth's population. The Skull's army reach New York, destroying the Hydra, killing President Osborn, and decimating Luke Cage's police forces. In the process, the Skull also telepathically enslaves May Parker, who is host to the symbiote Venom and daughter of the aging and disillusioned Peter Parker. Defending the city, Captain America and his allies quickly fall to the Skull's powers. But while the Skull is distracted by Alicia Grimm's animated clay constructs, Captain America kills the would-be child dictator and liberates his unwilling followers. Before the heroes can celebrate, the cosmic Celestials arrive on Earth to germinate the embryo they had implanted within the planet eons ago. As the Celestials prepare to attack New York, Tony Stark sacrifices himself in an attack on the aliens, while Black Bolt is killed as he performs a last-minute cry for help into the galaxy. The call is heard and the Celestials are repelled by the new Galactus (formerly Franklin Richards), who consumes the Celestial embryo. After these events, X-51 tires of Uatu's pride and realizes how heartless and cruel the former Watcher truly is. He defeats Uatu by removing his source of hearing, leaving him useless. Reed converts his vibranium power network into ""Human Torches"", hoping to burn off the Terrigen Mists and restore Earth's human population. Universe X. With the Celestial embryo gone, Earth's mass is reduced, causing a shift in orbit and polarity as well as drastic worldwide climate changes. One-fourth of New York's population dies as temperatures plummet. The Tong of Creel, a cult dedicated to reassembling the Absorbing Man, begins killing those who hold his fragments. Under Mephisto's influence, Pope Immortus founds a church advocating mutant dominance of the galaxy and the destruction of Reed's Human Torches. Meanwhile, Mar-Vell is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Him and Her, though his soul remains in the Realm of the Dead. Captain America becomes the Mar-Vell child's guardian and embarks on a worldwide quest with his new ward to obtain various items in order to deal with Earth's restless mutant population and prepare for an impending war in the Realm of the Dead. Arriving at Zero Street, the duo is attacked by the Night People, and Captain America sacrifices his life to save the Mar-Vell child. When the Tong of Creel finally reassembles the Absorbing Man in New York, he attacks the city's Human Torch. Battling New York's heroes, the Absorbing Man absorbs Manhattan itself, adding its buildings and streets to his being, but Loki and Iron Maiden convince the villain to transform himself into vibranium and use his mass to stabilize the planet's fluctuating orbit and polarity. Meanwhile in the Realm of the Dead, Mar-Vell leads an army of deceased heroes and villains against Thanos and Death. With the artifacts collected by himself and Captain America in his possession, Mar-Vell shows Thanos how Death has manipulated him and convinces Thanos to use the Ultimate Nullifier on the entity. Paradise X. With Death destroyed, Mar-Vell constructs a Paradise in the center of the Negative Zone for the dead to inhabit. However, those among the living find themselves unable to die. Meanwhile, X-51 decides that the inhabitants of alternate Earths should be warned about the Celestial embryos he believes are growing within their planets. He spreads the alarm across the multiverse by recruiting and dispatching Heralds from alternate timelines such as Bloodstorm (Ororo Monroe, Earth-1298), Deathlok (Luther Manning, Earth-7484), Hyperion (Earth-1121), Killraven (Earth-691), Iron Man 2020 (Earth-8410), Spider-Girl (Earth-1122), and Wolverine (Days of Future Past Earth-811). After banishing the Watchers of Earth-9997 to alternate worlds with the hope that their presence will lead to the discovery and destruction of each Celestial embryo, X-51 takes his Heralds to his Earth, where he will aid each in achieving his or her wishes. In Mar-Vell's Paradise, the High Evolutionary's equipment transforms the souls of Black Bolt, Captain America, Daredevil (Matt Murdock), Dr. Doom, Giant-Man, Phoenix, and Tony Stark into the Avenging Host, charged with ushering souls from the Realm of the Dead to Paradise. Those who enter Paradise consume a piece of the Cosmic Cube, enabling them to create their own, seemingly perfect pocket reality. But as more souls enter Paradise, it begins to expand and consume entire worlds within the Negative Zone, causing Blastaar and Annihilus to attack the Baxter Building in New York. Reed Richards, Bruce Banner, the Beast, and several other brilliant scientists convene to discuss a solution to Death's absence. They decide to access the imprisoned Jude the Entropic Man, who can turn others to dust on contact, and synthesize his essence into a chemical to end the suffering of those unable to die. With the chemical complete, Reed, growing suspicious of Mar-Vell's motives, plans to use Pym Particles to slow Paradise's rapid growth within the Negative Zone. But Mephisto frees Jude from captivity, convincing him to go on a massive killing spree. Mephisto then steers Jude to Britain, where Mephisto hopes to find the Siege Perilous, which will allow him to traverse the multiverse. But with the help of Merlin, Doctor Strange, Psylocke, and the sacrifice of a recently-resurrected Meggan, King Britain is able to slay Mephisto with Excalibur. Meanwhile, in Paradise, Reed and a legion of heroes confront Mar-Vell. After Paradise is nearly conquered in the name of the Supreme Intelligence by the arriving souls of the Kree military, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that he (Reed) is to become the new Eternity. Using his new role as Eternity, Reed is able to put an end to the conflict and free the remaining heroes from their Cosmic Cube-induced dream-worlds, Johnny Storm being the last freed. Once this is accomplished, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that his plan is to build a galactic wall around their universe, preventing any further influence from the Celestials. Feeling that his work is not yet complete, Mar-Vell tells the people of Paradise that he is going to the source of Excalibur, which is strongly implied to be the original universe. Characters (""Earth X"" and ""Universe X""). Avengers. Avenging Host. After Mar-Vell had killed Death, he reshaped part of the Realm of the Dead into a paradise and selected a group of dead heroes to be its guardians called the Avenging Host where most of its members have angel-like forms. Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four no longer exist. X-Men. New X-Men. This is the new incarnation of the X-Men that is led by Cyclops. They were former members of the second Daredevil's circus: Clarifications. Initially, the ""Earth X"" storyline was purported as being the future of Earth-616. However, the series often substantially retconned the origins and workings of characters to better suit the story, to the point where they were no longer reconcilable with their counterparts in the mainstream Marvel Universe. One example was the revelation in ""Paradise X"" that Wolverine is not a mutant at all, but instead one of the few remaining ""pure strain humans"", free from the genetic manipulations of the Celestials (as well as a descendent of Moon-Boy). Marvel editors solved these discrepancies by officially declaring that anything stated in ""Earth X"" would not be considered canonical. It was also later revealed in issue #11 of ""Paradise X"" that the events shown in the series are not set in an alternative future, but rather an alternative present (the issue reveals that ""Paradise X"" is set in 2003, the year of publication). The ""Paradise X"" series was never properly concluded, due to editorial interference midway through its publication. Due to dwindling sales, the ""X"" and ""A"" specials, which were intended to be double-sized issues, were both reduced to 22 pages and the intended ending was never used as a result. Writer Jim Krueger expressed dismay at the loss of pages and not being able to use the original ending. In the intended ending, Captain America, suspecting Captain Marvel's treachery, would have killed Marvel just as Marvel put the energy wall around the universe to keep out the Celestials and Elders. At this final moment, having ascended to the throne of Paradise, Captain America would have realized that Marvel's intentions were good. ""Cap would have sat on the throne, completely unworthy of it. And this, this would have been the final testing necessary to make Cap worthy of it."" Additionally, a planned limited series, ""Tales of Earth X"", was proposed but never greenlighted. The series, set before the events of ""Earth X"", would have revealed the final days of characters like Professor X before the mutation that turned the world into mutants and killed all of Earth's psychics. A one-shot called ""The Earth X Companion"" was released in 2008, containing production notes and sketches by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross as well as a short story drawn by artist Bill Reinhold detailing the fate of one of Nick Fury's Life Model Decoys. Collected editions. In September 2005, Marvel released a 592 page hardcover deluxe edition of ""Earth X"". This new edition includes 12 issues of the ""Earth X"" regular series, the #0 and #X bookends, the #1/2 issue (drawn by artist Bill Reinhold), and the Epilogue. It also contains extras pulled from the Graphitti hardcover, Marvel's trade paperback and the sketchbooks. The various volumes include: Accompanying volumes include: "
wikipedia-2336398," Creacionismo  Creationism () was a literary movement, initiated by Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro around 1912. Creationism is based on the idea of a poem as a truly ""new"" thing, created by the author for the sake of itself — that is, not to praise another thing, not to please the reader, not even to be understood by its own author. Huidobro himself defined it as ""a general aesthetic theory"" rather than a school of art. He proposed that poetry should not be a commentary, something written about something else. In his own words: Huidobro cites as inspiration some ""admirable poems"" of Tristan Tzara, though their ""creation"" is more formal than fundamental, and also some works by Francis Picabia, Georges Ribémont Dessaignes, Paul Éluard, and the Spanish poets Juan Larrea and Gerardo Diego (which Huidobro calls ""the two Spanish creationist poets""). The poet also claims that creationist poetry is by its own nature universal and universally translatable, ""since the new facts remain identical in all tongues"", while the other elements that prevail in non-creationist poetry, such as the rhyme and music of the words, vary among languages and cannot be easily translated, thus causing the poem to lose part of its essence.

wikipedia-2336416," William McIntosh  William McIntosh (1775 – April 30, 1825), also known as ""Taskanugi Hatke"" (White Warrior), was one of the most prominent chiefs of the Creek Nation between the turn of the nineteenth century and the time of Creek removal to Indian Territory. He was a leader of the Lower Towns, the Creek who were adapting European-American ways and tools. In 1817 he was implicated with David Brydie Mitchell, former Georgia governor and US Indian agent to the Creek, of smuggling African slaves in from Spanish Florida, in violation of US law against the international slave trade. For decades, European-American historians attributed McIntosh's achievements and influence to his Scots/European ancestry; more recently, historians have understood how his power related to the Creek matrilineal culture and his heritage. Early life and education. ""Taskanugi Hatke"" (White Warrior) was born in the Lower Towns in present-day Georgia to ""Senoya"" (also spelled ""Senoia"" and ""Senoy""), a member of the Wind Clan, which was prominent in the Creek Nation. As the Creek had a matrilineal system of property and hereditary leadership, his mother's status determined that of White Warrior. Also called William McIntosh, the boy had a Scots-American father, Captain William McIntosh, connected to a prominent Savannah, Georgia family. Captain McIntosh, a Loyalist, had worked with the Creek to recruit them as allies to the British during the American Revolutionary War. His mother was Jennet (or Janet in some sources) McGillivray, believed to have been a sister of the Scot Lachlan McGillivray, a wealthy fur trader and planter in Georgia, who was of the Clan MacGillivray Chiefs Lineage). After the war, Captain McIntosh moved to Savannah and married his cousin, Barbara McIntosh. White Warrior gained his status and place among the Creek from his mother's clan. Benjamin Hawkins, first appointed as United States Indian agent in the Southeast and then as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the territory south of the Ohio River, lived among the Creek and Choctaw, and knew them well. He commented in letters to President Thomas Jefferson that Creek women were matriarchs and had control of children ""when connected with a white man."" Hawkins further observed that even wealthy traders were nearly as ""inattentive"" to their mixed-race children as ""the Indians"". What he did not understand about the Creek culture was that the children had a closer relationship with their mother's eldest brother than with their biological father, because of the importance of the clan structure. Through both his mother and father, McIntosh was related to numerous other influential Creek chiefs, many of whom at the time were of mixed race. They were descendants of strategic marriages between high-status Creek women and the mostly Scots fur traders in the area. The most prominent was Alexander McGillivray, the son of Sehoy, a Wind Clan mother, and Lachlan McGillivray; and William Weatherford (better known in history as Red Eagle or ""Lamochatta""), also born to the Wind Clan. Both men became well established as Creek chiefs and wealthy planters but Weatherford became aligned with the traditionalist Red Sticks of the Upper Towns. Marriage and children. McIntosh married a Creek woman named Susanna Coe, and they had several children, including a son named Chilly. Two of their daughters married the brothers Samuel and Benjamin Hawkins. As a successful Creek man, McIntosh took a second wife, Peggy, who was Cherokee. His third wife lived on a plantation 50 miles away. She was Eliza Hawkins, the daughter of Stephen Hawkins. Personal. William McIntosh was of mixed Creek and European descent, chiefly Scots. As his mother was Creek, he was raised as a member of her clan within the Creek nation, which was matrilineal. His father was Captain William McIntosh, part of the powerful McGillivray family of Savannah. The son McIntosh became a wealthy planter and slaveholder; he was influential in both Creek and European-American society. This pattern was similar to that of several of his high-ranking, mixed-race Creek relatives. For generations, Creek chiefs had approved their daughters' marriages to fur traders in order to strengthen their alliances and trading power with the wealthy Europeans. Career. McIntosh used his influence to improve a route from Talladega, Alabama to his ferry on the Chattahoochee River, which was a source of revenue. Parts of it are still referred to as the McIntosh Road. He also developed a plantation and owned black slaves. The Creek were forced to cede lands to the United States in the early 1800s. While influential, McIntosh was said to have collaborated with the US Indian Agent Mitchell on defrauding the Creek of annuity monies from their land cessions. After the United States prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, he arranged to smuggle African slaves into the Mississippi Territory from Spanish Florida. The Creek Nation struggled with internal tensions after the American Revolutionary War and during the War of 1812, when both sides tried to engage them as allies. The Lower Towns, which comprised the majority, were adapting some elements of European culture, as had been encouraged by the British and later Americans. This included education in English; for some, adoption of Christianity; as well as forms of European dress and houses - to show they were equally ""civilized"". They expanded their farms and some of the elite purchased chattel African slaves to work their plantations. Internal Creek tensions resulted in the Creek War (1813-1814), when the Red Sticks of the Upper Towns attacked some Lower Creek settlements. McIntosh and other Lower Creek allied with United States forces against them after 1813. McIntosh fought with General Andrew Jackson and state militias in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, marking the defeat of the Red Sticks and the end of the Creek War. He was made a brigadier general. After the wars, European-American settlers were increasingly migrating to the interior of the Southeast from the coastal areas. First Seminole War. Remnants of Creek, other American Indian tribes, and fugitive slaves had migrated to Spanish Florida during the late 18th century, when they formed a new tribe, known as the Seminole. Georgia slaves had escaped and also taken refuge in Spanish-held Florida, where the Crown offered them freedom and land. After the War of 1812, the British withdrew and turned over Fort Gadsden, on the lower Apalachicola River, to blacks in the area. It was occupied by about 300 black men, women, and children, 20 renegade Choctaw, and a few Seminole warriors, led by a black named Garcon. Georgia slaveholders called it the ""Negro Fort,"" and worried that the independence of the blacks would encourage their slaves to escape or rebel. McIntosh fought for the United States in the First Seminole War and helped capture Fort Gadsden. When the Americans shot a heated cannonball into the fort, it struck the magazine and set off a huge explosion. Most of the people within the fort died immediately. Letter to Madison. In 1817 McIntosh wrote to President James Madison, telling him that the more influential Cherokee leaders of mixed blood wanted to swap their land with the US government, which had been pushing for American Indian removal west of the Mississippi River. He wrote that the ""not so much civilized"" full bloods feared that the mixed-bloods would swap all the Cherokee land, leaving them ""without any land to walk on."" African importation case of 1820. After President James Monroe came to office, in November 1817 his administration appointed David Brydie Mitchell as US Indian agent to the Creek. Mitchell had formerly been the governor of Georgia (1809-1813) (1815-1817), as well as holding other posts in the state. He and McIntosh became implicated in the African importation case of 1820, tried as ""Miguel de Castro v. Ninety-five African Negros"" (1819-1820) in Admiralty Court, because it was in violation of the US law, effective 1808, to end the international slave trade. The Africans had been taken by the privateer ""Commodore"" Aury from a Spanish ship bound for Havana, and transported to Amelia Island off Florida, for smuggling into the United States. McIntosh and Mitchell discussed accepting the slaves under Creek sovereignty independent of the United States. Treaty of Indian Springs, 1825. Under pressure from the United States and the state of Georgia, some Creek chiefs had ceded land. The United States was trying to encourage the Creek and other Southeast tribes to cede their lands in exchange for payments and land west of the Mississippi River, in what was called Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas.) The National Council, including McIntosh, passed legislation making it a capital crime to alienate communal land. On February 12, 1825, McIntosh and eight other chiefs, including his sons-in-law Samuel and Benjamin Hawkins, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs. They ceded all the Creek land in Georgia to the United States in exchange for $200,000. The fifth article of the treaty stipulated, ""That the treaty commissioners pay the first $200,000 directly to the McIntosh party."" Historians continue to argue over whether McIntosh ceded the land for personal gain, or because he believed removal was inevitable and he was trying to achieve some security for the Creek Nation. Death. The National Council ruled that the signatories had to be executed for ceding the land. On April 30, 1825, the Red Stick leader ""Menawa,"" and 120-150 Law Menders from towns in the ceded territory, set McIntosh's house on fire. McIntosh escaped from the house with ""Etommee Tustunnuggee,"" another Creek chief who signed the 1825 treaty. They were killed by gunfire. Later that day, the Law Menders found the Hawkins brothers; they hanged Samuel and shot Benjamin, but he escaped. Members of the National Council, including Menawa, went to Washington to protest the 1825 treaty. The US government rejected the 1825 treaty as fraudulent, and negotiated the 1826 Treaty of Washington, which allowed the Creek to keep about in Alabama. In this new treaty, the Creek received an immediate payment of $217,660 and a perpetual annuity of $20,000. The state of Georgia ignored the new treaty and worked to evict the Creek from their lands before removal started in the 1830s. His interment was at the McIntosh Reserve in Carroll County, Georgia. "

wikipedia-2336454," Linda Christian  Linda Christian (November 13, 1923 – July 22, 2011) was a Mexican film actress, who appeared in Mexican and Hollywood films. Her career reached its peak in the 1940s and 1950s. She played Mara in the last Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film, ""Tarzan and The Mermaids"" (1948). She is also noted for being the first Bond girl, appearing in a 1954 television adaptation of the James Bond novel ""Casino Royale"". In 1963 she starred in an episode of ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"", ""An Out for Oscar"". Early life. Christian was born as Blanca Rosa Welter in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, a daughter of Dutch engineer and Royal Dutch Shell executive, Gerardus Jacob Welter (1904–1981), and his Mexican-born wife, the former Blanca Rosa Vorhauer (born 1901), who was of Spanish, German and French descent. The Welter family moved a great deal during Christian's youth, living everywhere from South America and Europe to the Middle East and Africa. As a result of this nomadic lifestyle, Christian became an accomplished polyglot with the ability to speak fluent French, German, Dutch, Spanish, English, Italian and even a bit of haphazard Arabic and Russian. Christian had three younger siblings, a sister, actress Ariadna Gloria Welter (1930–1998), and two brothers, Gerardus Jacob Welter (born 1924) and Edward Albert Welter (born 1932). Career. In her youth Christian's only aspiration was to become a physician. After she graduated from secondary school she had a fortuitous meeting with her screen idol Errol Flynn, who became her lover, and she was persuaded by him to give up her hopes of joining the medical profession, move to Hollywood, and pursue an acting career. Not long after arriving in Hollywood she was spotted by Louis B. Mayer's secretary at a fashion show in Beverly Hills. He offered, and she accepted, a seven-year contract with MGM. Her stage name was invented by Flynn, who gave her the surname of his character in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" even though Flynn was not in the picture but in another rendition of the story. She made her film debut in the 1944 musical comedy ""Up in Arms"", co-starring Danny Kaye and Dinah Shore. This movie also happened to be Danny Kaye's own first film. This film was followed by ""Holiday in Mexico"" (1946), ""Green Dolphin Street"" (1947), and what was perhaps her best-known film, ""Tarzan and the Mermaids"" (1948). She was the subject of a well-known photograph published in the January 1, 1949, issue of ""Vogue"". Linda was the first Bond girl to appear on screen, playing Valerie Mathis in the 1954 TV adaptation of Casino Royale (Climax!), beating Ursula Andress to the screen by eight years.  In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. Personal anecdotes. In the autobiography he wrote shortly before his death, ""My Wicked, Wicked Ways"", Flynn states that immediately after Linda Christian's screen test, he offered to get a couple of her teeth (which were crooked) fixed at his expense: when he got a whopping bill later, he discovered that she had taken the opportunity to undergo major cosmetic dentistry. Years later, when he met Linda again, he claims he said, ""Smile, baby – I want to see those choppers: they took their first bite out of me."" Marriages and relationships. Christian's fame, however, was largely derived from having married (and divorced) the popular screen idol Tyrone Power from 1949 to 1956. The couple married in Rome, Italy, at Santa Francesca Romana church; Christian wore a formfitting gold-damask gown, and the church was decorated with two thousand 'Esther' carnations. [http://tyforum.bravepages.com/artc/oggi-2-3-49.html] She and Power were the parents of singer Romina Power and actress Taryn Power. Romina was one half of the Italian singing duo Al Bano and Romina Power. A month after she divorced Tyrone Power, Christian was seen with Spanish athlete Alfonso de Portago, who was married to American Carroll de Portago (later Carroll Petrie). Carroll had recently given birth to ""Fon's"" second child Anthony. De Portago was also dating model Dorian Leigh, mother of his recently born illegitimate son Kim. Linda was photographed with de Portago at the 1957 Mille Miglia car race. The photo shows Christian leaning in to kiss Fon before he drove off and crashed his Ferrari, killing himself, his navigator Ed Nelson and at least ten spectators in the process. The press labeled the photo ""The Kiss of Death"". De Portago was 28 years old. Her ex-husband, Tyrone Power, died the following year of a heart attack at the age of 44. Christian was later married to the Rome-based British actor Edmund Purdom. On several occasions Christian and Power were offered the opportunity to work together, but for various reasons each offer was refused or rescinded. The most notable opportunity to co-star together came in 1953, when they were offered leading roles in ""From Here to Eternity"". Power did not want to do the film and rejected the offer. The roles went to Donna Reed and Montgomery Clift.  "
wikipedia-2336460," Isaiah Thomas  Isaiah Thomas (January 30, 1749 – April 4, 1831), was an American newspaper publisher and author. He performed the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence in Worcester, Massachusetts, and reported the first account of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He was the founder of the American Antiquarian Society. Biography. Early life and career. Thomas was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was apprenticed on July 7, 1756 to Zechariah Fowle, a Boston printer, with whom, after working as a printer in Halifax, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Charleston, South Carolina, he formed a partnership in 1770. The ""Massachusetts Spy"". The partnership was formed to publish the ""Massachusetts Spy"", and lasted for three months, after which Thomas continued publication alone. For the paper's motto, he chose “Open to all parties, but influenced by none.” Initially it came out three times each week, then (under his sole ownership) as a semi-weekly, and beginning in 1771, as a weekly. The paper soon espoused the Whig cause and was the object of government efforts to suppress it. In 1771 Gov. Thomas Hutchinson ordered the attorney general to prosecute Thomas, but the grand jury failed to find cause for indictment. In Boston, in 1774, Thomas published the ""Royal American Magazine"", which was continued for a short time by Joseph Greenleaf, and which contained many engravings by Paul Revere. Escape to Worcester. Wary of the Tories' growing resentment of the independence of the ""Spy"", on April 16, 1775 (three days before the Battle of Concord, in which he took part), Thomas took his presses from Boston and set them up in Worcester. His other property was destroyed. In Worcester, he published and sold books, built a paper mill and bindery, and continued the paper until 1802 save for gaps in 1776-1778 and in 1786-1788. The ""Spy"" supported George Washington and the Federalist Party. He was also postmaster for a time.  Thomas married Mary Fowle, described as a ""half-cousin"", on May 26, 1779. Around 1802, Thomas gave his Worcester business over to his son, including the control of the ""Spy"". Later life. From 1775 until 1803, Thomas published the ""New England Almanac"", continued until 1819 by his son, Isaiah Thomas, Jr. It had something of the flavor of Benjamin Franklin's ""Poor Richard's Almanac"". In 1786 he procured from Europe the first font of music type that was brought to the United States, and he was the first printer in the U.S. to use such type. He was engaged at Walpole, New Hampshire, in book publishing and printing the ""Farmer's Museum"", and in 1788 opened a bookstore in Boston under the firm name of Thomas and Andrews, also establishing branches of his publishing business in several parts of the United States. The monthly ""Massachusetts Magazine"" was published by the firm, with Ebenezer T. Andrews, in eight volumes, from 1789 until 1796. At Worcester he printed a folio edition of the Bible in 1791, Watts' ""Psalms and Hymns"", and most of the Bibles and school books that were used in the U.S. at that date. His ambition throughout his life was to write an extensive book on the history of publishing.  He began what would become ""History of Printing in America"" in 1808. Fully titled ""History of Printing in America, with a Biography of Printers, and an Account of Newspapers"", it was published in two volumes in 1810. A second edition, published in 1874, was prepared by his grandson Benjamin Franklin Thomas and included a catalog of American publications previous to 1776 and a memoir of Isaiah Thomas. In November 1812, Thomas founded the American Society of Antiquaries, now known as the American Antiquarian Society, partly to take care of the extensive library he had accumulated in preparing his history of publishing. At its first meeting, Thomas was elected president, a role he held until his death. In addition to nearly 8,000 volumes from his collection, he gave to its library tracts, and one of the most valuable files of newspapers in the country, and he presented land and a hall, with a provision equal to $24,000 for its maintenance. Thomas spent his final days in Worcester. Upon his death in 1831, he bequeathed his entire library, his collection of early American newspapers, as well as his personal papers and records to the American Antiquarian Society. Legacy. Thomas's grandson B. F. Thomas noted his grandfather's importance in founding the American Antiquarian Society. ""He saw and understood, no man better, from what infinitely varied and minute sources the history of a nation's life was to be drawn; that the only safe rule was to gather up all the fragments so that nothing be lost."" In 1943, ""Publishers Weekly"" created the Carey-Thomas Award for creative publishing, naming it honor of Mathew Carey and Isaiah Thomas. Quotation.

wikipedia-2336494," Yellow mongoose  The Yellow Mongoose (""Cynictis penicillata""), sometimes referred to as the red meerkat, is a small mammal averaging about 1 lb (1/2 kg) in weight and about 20 in (500 mm) in length. A member of the mongoose family, it lives in open country, from semi-desert scrubland to grasslands in Angola, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. Taxonomy. ""Cynictis penicillata"" is the only member of its genus, but as many as twelve subspecies of yellow mongoose have been described. In general, the yellow mongoose has lighter highlights on the underbelly and chin, a bushy tail, and a complete lack of sexual dimorphism. Southern yellow mongooses are larger, have yellow or reddish fur, longer fur, and a longer tail with a characteristic white tip. Northern subspecies tend towards smaller size, grey colouration, a grey or darker grey tip to the tail, and shorter hair more appropriate to the hotter climate. Habits. The yellow mongoose is carnivorous, consuming mostly arthropods but also other small mammals, lizards, snakes and eggs of all kinds.  The yellow mongoose is primarily diurnal, though nocturnal activity has been observed. Living in colonies of up to 20 individuals in a permanent underground burrow complex, the yellow mongoose will often co-exist with Cape Ground Squirrels or suricates and share maintenance of the warren, adding new tunnels and burrows as necessary. The tunnel system has many entrances, nearby which the yellow mongoose makes its latrines. Social structure. The social structure of the yellow mongoose is hierarchical, based around a central breeding pair and their most recent offspring. There are also subadults, the elderly, or adult relatives of the central pair. Male ranges tend to overlap, while females from other dens have contiguous non-overlapping ranges. Every day, the alpha male will mark members of his group with anal gland secretions, and his boundaries with facial and anal secretions, as well as urine. The alpha male also rubs his back against raised objects, leaving behind hair as a visual marker of territory. Other members of the group mark their dens with cheek secretions.Colony's members can be from 20-40 members. Predators. Predators of the yellow mongoose are birds of prey, snakes and jackals. When frightened, the yellow mongoose will growl and secrete from its anal glands. It can also scream, bark, and purr, though these are exceptions, as the yellow mongoose is usually silent, and communicates mood and status through tail movements. Mating season. The mating season of the yellow mongoose is between July and September, and it gives birth underground between October and December, with no bedding material, in a clean chamber of the burrow system. Usually, two offspring are produced per pregnancy, and they are weaned at 10 weeks, reaching adult size after 10 months. Cynictis penicillata and Rabies. There is some concern about the role of ""Cynictis penicillata"" as a natural reservoir of rabies. Most African wild animals will die within a several weeks of infection with rabies, but it seems that certain genetic strains of the yellow mongoose can carry it asymptomatically, but infectiously, for years.

wikipedia-2336495," Airborne Ranger  Airborne Ranger is a video game developed and released by MicroProse in 1987. The game is a relatively (for its era) realistic action game in which a sole U.S. Army Ranger is sent to infiltrate the enemy territory to complete various objectives. Gameplay. The game consists of several missions, in which the player controls a sole Ranger whose objectives include killing an enemy officer, destroying an enemy bunker, taking out a SAM site, and rescuing a captured POW, which would possibly free a roster member that was labeled P.O.W. The game creates the maps and objective locations randomly, so the player is required to plan each mission carefully, because no mission is the same.  At the start of each mission, the player is presented with a short overview of the mission, and can select a Ranger from a roster of available soldiers. The player is then in control of an aircraft, described as a V-22 Osprey and is allowed to drop three ammo crates over the enemy territory. Once the three containers are dropped, the Ranger is parachuted into the area. Upon touch-down, the player has to overcome several obstacles, including enemy soldiers and officers, mine fields, foxholes and bunkers. Due to limited ammunition, the player needs to plan his path through the territory. The dropped ammo crates provide the soldier with fresh hand grenades and ammo. A player is even able actually change the color of his uniform to match the enemy and thereby not be attacked by them. After completing the mission, the Ranger has to navigate to a pick-up point within a time limit. If the Ranger is captured (but not killed), the player can start an optional rescue mission using another soldier from the roster. Each successful mission increases the rank of the individual Ranger, up to colonel. Manual. The manual mimics a Field Manual of the U.S. Army, and brings the number of code FM75-041, non-existent outside the fiction of the game. The manual includes 40 pages in black and white, plus the color cover of thin cardboard. It is divided into two parts with 11 chapters in all. In the second part talks about the true story of U.S. Rangers from 1759 to the American Revolution to World War II, the Korean War, until today, with the Vietnam War, the invasion of Grenada in 1983, their training and equipment, operations mountains, desert and jungle, consisting of a paraglider, a Colt CAR-15 rifle, on the hand fragmentation M26 grenade, a grenade launcher M72 LAW, the M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine and the ranger knife F7. Aside from informational purposes, the manual was used as a form of copyright protection - each time you loaded the game it would give the player a multiple choice question on the identification of military ribbons, which were listed at the top of each page throughout the booklet. If the player answered correctly, the game loaded. If guessed incorrectly, the game wouldn't load. Reception. A review in ""Computer Gaming World"" felt ""Airborne Ranger"" was reminiscent of the earlier arcade game ""Commando"", but much deeper and more versatile. The graphics and sound were praised, noting gunfire sounds different when shot from inside fortifications than it does outside fortifications. The game received 4½ out of 5 stars in ""Dragon"". Legacy. The game was followed by ""Special Forces"" in 1991. In 2008, Atari informally announced a game called ""Airborne Rangers"" for the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC to be released in April 2009, but the game was never mentioned again and is presumed to having been cancelled.

wikipedia-2336561," Spanish Mastiff  The Spanish Mastiff, or ""Mastín Español"" is a large breed of dog, originating in Spain, originally bred to be a Livestock guardian dog and a guard dog whose purpose is to defend livestock from wolves and other predators. The Mountain dog type has a heavier coat, and is more commonly exhibited at dog shows. Roots and history. The Spanish Mastiff is thought to have descended from Greek dogs brought to Spain via Greek and Phoenician maritime traders starting around 1000 BC. The Greeks used similar dogs in battle because of their strength. During the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used Spanish Mastiffs and other Molossers in battle against Native Americans, like the Taínos, Aztecs, or Mayans. These specially trained dogs were feared by the Indians for their strength and ferocity. Appearance. The Spanish Mastiff is a very large and powerful dog, similar in appearance to the other Mastiff breeds. They have a large powerful head, with loose folds of skin and a double dewlap on the neck. Males in this breed are at least 77 cm tall at the withers, and range from 80–120 kg. Females are at least 72 cm, and weigh 70–100 kg.  This dog has a long muzzle compared to many other mastiffs. It has small eyes and drop ears resembling triangles. This dog's coat is most often reddish or fawn-colored, but can also be brindle, black or 'wolf' colored. Temperament. This noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent. It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Spanish Mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family. Socialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs. The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle. Once the trainer has established the dog's respect as leader, the Spanish Mastiff will be an extremely loyal pet. Exercise. This dog is more inclined to lumber than gallop, but it can move quite rapidly when necessary. A long daily walk will be sufficient, although it will appreciate a fenced area where it can exercise at its own rate. "
wikipedia-2336562," Galt House  The Galt House is a 25-story, 1300-room hotel in Louisville, Kentucky. The original hotel was erected in 1837. The current Galt House is presently the city's only hotel on the Ohio River. Many noted people have stayed at the Galt House, including Jefferson Davis, Charles Dickens, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. A $60 million renovation of the complex has been completed, which consists of extensively renovated east and west towers connected across Fourth Street with a new $4 million conservatory. The conservatory is three stories in height and enclosed by steel and glass. It features a cafe, a cocktail lounge and gathering area, an aviary and greenhouse space on one level with large trees and foliage. It offers views of downtown Louisville and the Ohio River. Furthermore a newly constructed pedestrian bridge crossing Main Street connects the Galt House and Riverfront Plaza Towers with the rest of the Downtown Louisville skybridge system. The Galt House is home to the command center for Thunder Over Louisville, the nation's largest fireworks show, held annually as the kickoff event for the Kentucky Derby Festival. It also hosts the Kentucky State Governor's Cup academic competition every year. History. The Galt House was, in the early 19th century, the residence of Dr. W.C. Galt. The house was located at the corner of Second and Main Street. In 1834, the first instance of the Galt House as a hotel was established and in 1835 was opened as a 60-room hotel on the northeast corner of Second and Main streets in Louisville. During the nineteenth century, The Galt House was acclaimed as Louisville's best hotel. During the Civil War, the Galt House was utilized for meetings of Union generals. In September 1862, it was the scene of an unusual murder, when General Jefferson C. Davis (not to be confused with Confederate President Jefferson Davis) shot Union General William ""Bull"" Nelson after a dispute. In March 1864, Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman met at the Galt House to plan the invasion that led to the successful capture of Atlanta, Georgia and Sherman's March to the Sea. What was to be the first Galt House burned down in 1865. Four years later, in 1869, a larger Galt House was established on the corner of First and Main streets. Known as being the center of Louisville's social community during this time, the hotel subsequently fell on hard times in the next 50 years and was closed in 1919 due to financial difficulties. Soon after, in 1921, the building was demolished. Over a half a century later, in 1972, the Galt House Hotel was reestablished by developer Al J Schneider as part of Louisville's Riverfront Urban Renewal Project. The West (RIVUE) Tower is 25 stories high and features deluxe guest rooms. An East (Suite) Tower was added in 1984. It offers 650 suites, including waterfront balcony suites and waterfront apartments. At nearly 1,300 guest rooms, Galt House Hotel is the largest hotel in Kentucky. It boasts 128,000 square feet of meeting space, including 53 meeting rooms, two ballrooms and an exhibit hall. On-site there are six restaurants, a business and shipping center, a spa and salon, a barbershop and retail shops. Every year since 1986, the statewide Governor's Cup has been held at the Galt House Hotel. It is the Official Hotel of Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby.  Al J Schneider's daughter, Mary Moseley, became President and CEO of the company and has led a more than $70 million renovation of the Galt House Hotel. Under her leadership, many updates and renovations have been completed, including the addition of a 3-story glass-jewel Conservatory that links the Suite and RIVUE Towers over Fourth Street. Additionally, renovations to the Grand Ballroom and Archibald Cochran Ballroom, as well as to guest rooms and meeting rooms. Club 360 Rooftop Fitness Center and the Rooftop Garden and Terrace offer stunning views of the city of Louisville and the Ohio River. Those views are even more impressive from RIVUE Restaurant and Lounge, 25 stories atop the west tower. Other improvements include skywalks built connecting the hotel to the Kentucky International Convention Center and the KFC Yum! Center.  In 2010, Galt House Hotel introduced a new Christmas event, Christmas at the Galt House Hotel. It has grown to include the KaLightoscope Attraction featuring larger-than-life luminaries crafted by Chinese artisans, the Christmas Village with the Snow Fairy Princess and her Castle, the Candy Cane Forest with the Peppermint Express kiddie train ride and some 100 animated characters, and nearly three dozen restored figures from the former Stewart's Department Store holiday windows in downtown Louisville. Christmas at the Galt House Hotel also includes the Colors of the Season Holiday Dinner Show, and new in 2013 Sing 'n' Joy International Choral Festival and Competition.  "

wikipedia-2336592," Flight envelope  In aerodynamics, the flight envelope, service envelope, or performance envelope of an aircraft refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of airspeed and load factor or altitude. The term is somewhat loosely applied, and can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a plane is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown ""outside the envelope"", something considered rather dangerous. Flight envelope is one of a number of related terms that are all used in a similar fashion. It is perhaps the most common term because it is the oldest, first being used in the early days of test flying. It is closely related to more modern terms known as extra power and a doghouse plot which are different ways of describing a flight envelope. Extra power. Extra power, or Specific Excess Power, is a very basic method of determining an aircraft's flight envelope. It is easily calculated, but as a downside does not tell very much about the actual performance of the aircraft at different altitudes.  Choosing any particular set of parameters will generate the needed power for a particular aircraft for those conditions. For instance a Cessna 150 at 2,500 ft (800 m) altitude and 90 mph (140 km/h) speed needs about 60 hp (45 kW) to fly straight and level. The C150 is normally equipped with a 100 hp (75 kW) engine, so in this particular case the plane has 40 hp (30 kW) of extra power. In overall terms this is very little extra power, 60% of the engine's output is already used up just keeping the plane in the air. The leftover 40 hp (30 kW) is all that the aircraft has to maneuver with, meaning it can climb, turn, or speed up only a small amount. To put this in perspective, the C150 could not maintain a 2""g"" (20 m/s²) turn, which would require 120 hp (or somewhat more) under the same conditions. For the same conditions a fighter aircraft might require considerably more power due to their wings being inefficient at low speeds, for argument's sake it might require 10,000 hp (7.5 MW). However modern jet engines can provide considerable power, the equivalent of 50,000 hp (37 MW) typically. With this amount of extra power the aircraft can achieve very high maximum rate of climb, even climb straight up, make powerful continual maneuvers, or fly at very high speeds. Doghouse plot. A doghouse plot generally shows the relation between speed at level flight and altitude, although other variables are also possible. It takes more effort to make than an extra power calculation, but in turn provides much more information such as ideal flight altitude. The plot typically looks something like an upside-down U and is commonly referred to as a doghouse plot due to its resemblance to a doghouse. The diagram on the right shows a very simplified plot which shall be used to explain the general shape of the plot. The outer edges of the diagram, the envelope, show the possible conditions that the aircraft can reach in straight and level flight. For instance, the aircraft described by the black altitude envelope on the right can fly at altitudes up to about 52,000 feet, at which point the thinner air means it can no longer climb. The aircraft can also fly at up to Mach 1.1 at sea level, but no faster. This outer surface of the curve represents the ""zero-extra-power condition"". All of the area under the curve represents conditions that the plane can fly at with power to spare, for instance, this aircraft can fly at Mach 0.5 at 30,000 feet while using less than full power. In the case of high-performance aircraft, including fighters, this ""1-g"" line showing straight-and-level flight is augmented with additional lines showing the maximum performance at various g loadings. In the diagram at right, the green line represents, 2-g, the blue line 3-g, and so on. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has a very small area just below Mach 1 and close to sea level where it can maintain a 9-g turn. Flying outside the envelope is possible, since it represents the straight-and-level condition only. For instance diving the aircraft allows higher speeds, using gravity as a source of additional power. Likewise higher altitude can be reached by first speeding up and then going ballistic, a maneuver known as a zoom climb. Stalling speed. All fixed-wing aircraft have a minimum speed at which they can maintain level flight, the stall speed (left limit line in the diagram). As the aircraft gains altitude the stall speed increases; since the wing is not growing any larger the only way to support the aircraft's weight with less air is to increase speed. While the exact numbers will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft, the nature of this relationship is typically the same; plotted on a graph of speed (x-axis) vs. altitude (y-axis) it forms a diagonal line. Service ceiling. Inefficiencies in the wings also make this line ""tilt over"" with increased altitude, until it becomes horizontal and no additional speed will result in increased altitude. This maximum altitude is known as the service ceiling (top limit line in the diagram), and is often quoted for aircraft performance. The area where the altitude for a given speed can no longer be increased at level flight is known as ""zero rate of climb"" and is caused by the lift of the aircraft getting smaller at higher altitudes, until it no longer exceeds gravity. Top speed. The right side of the graph represents the maximum speed of the aircraft. This is typically sloped in the same manner as the stall line due to air resistance getting lower at higher altitudes, up to the point where an increase in altitude no longer increases the maximum speed due to lack of oxygen to feed the engines. The power needed varies almost linearly with altitude, but the nature of drag means that it varies with the square of speed—in other words it is typically easier to go higher than faster, up to the altitude where lack of oxygen for the engines starts to play a significant role. Velocity vs. Load factor chart. A chart of velocity versus load factor (or V-n diagram) is another way of showing limits of aircraft performance. It shows how much load factor can be safely achieved at different airspeeds. Sidenotes. Although it is easy to compare aircraft on simple numbers such as maximum speed or service ceiling, an examination of the flight envelope will reveal far more information. Generally a design with a larger area under the curve will have better all-around performance. This is because when the plane is not flying at the edges of the envelope, its extra power will be greater, and that means more power for things like climbing or maneuvering. General aviation aircraft have very small flight envelopes, with speeds ranging from perhaps 50 to 200 mph, whereas the extra power available to modern fighter aircraft result in huge flight envelopes with many times the area. As a tradeoff however, military aircraft often have a higher stalling speed. As a result of this the landing speed is also higher. ""Pushing the envelope"". This phrase is used to refer to an aircraft being taken to, and perhaps beyond, its designated altitude and speed limits. By extension, this phrase may be used to mean testing other limits, either within aerospace or in other fields e.g. Plus ultra (motto). "
wikipedia-2336630," Sebastian Barry  Sebastian Barry (born 5 July 1955) is an Irish playwright, novelist and poet. He is noted for his dense literary writing style and is considered one of Ireland's finest writers. Barry's literary career began in poetry before he began writing plays and novels. In recent years his fiction writing has surpassed his work in the theatre in terms of success, having once been considered a playwright who wrote occasional novels. He has twice been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for his novels ""A Long Long Way"" (2005) and ""The Secret Scripture"" (2008), the latter of which won the 2008 Costa Book of the Year and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His 2011 novel ""On Canaan's Side"" was longlisted for the Booker. Early life. Barry was born in Dublin. He is the son of the late Irish actress Joan O'Hara. He attended Catholic University School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he read English and Latin. He also served as an editor of ""Icarus"". Work. His academic posts have included Honorary Fellow in Writing at the University of Iowa (1984), Villanova University (2006) and Writer Fellow at Trinity College, Dublin (1995–1996). Barry started his literary career with the novel ""Macker's Garden"" in 1982. This was followed by several books of poetry and a further novel ""The Engine of Owl-Light"" in 1987 before his career as a playwright began with his first play produced in the Abbey theater, ""Boss Grady's Boys"" in 1988. Barry's maternal great-grandfather, James Dunne, provided the inspiration for the main character in his most internationally known play, ""The Steward of Christendom"". The main character, named Thomas Dunne in the play, was the chief superintendent of the Dublin Metropolitan Police from 1913-1922. He oversaw the area surrounding Dublin Castle until the Irish Free State takeover on 16 January 1922. One of his grandfathers belonged to the British Army Corps of Royal Engineers.  Both ""The Steward of Christendom"" and the novel ""The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty"", are about the dislocations (physical and otherwise) of loyalist Irish people during the political upheavals of the early 20th century. The title character of the latter (McNulty), for instance, is a young man forced to leave Ireland by his former friends for his political beliefs during the Anglo-Irish War. He also wrote ""Hinterland"", a satirical play based loosely on former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, the performance of which caused a minor controversy in Dublin. The ""Sunday Times"", which did not review the play, criticized it as ""feeble, puerile, trite, dissociated, shallow, exploitative and gratuitously offensive"". Barry's work in fiction came to the fore during the 1990s. His novel ""A Long Long Way"" was shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize, and was selected for Dublin's 2007 One City One Book event. Barry's 2008 novel, ""The Secret Scripture"" won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction (announced in August 2009), the oldest such award in the UK, the 2008 Costa Book of the Year (announced January 27, 2009) and in French translation ""Le testament caché"" it won the 2010 Cezam Prix Littéraire Inter CE. It was also a favourite to win the 2008 Man Booker Prize, narrowly losing out to Aravind Adiga's ""The White Tiger"". Sebastian Barry's most recent play is ""Andersen's English"", and is inspired by children's writer Hans Christian Andersen coming to stay with Charles Dickens and his family in the Kent marshes. Directed by Max Stafford-Clark and produced by Out of Joint and Hampstead Theatre, it toured in the UK from 11 February to 8 May 2010. ""On Canaan's Side"", Barry's fifth novel, concerns Lily Bere, the sister of the character Willy Dunne from ""A Long Long Way"" and the daughter of the character Thomas Dunne from ""The Steward of Christendom"", as she emigrates to the US. The novel was longlisted for the 2011 Man Booker Prize and won the 2012 Walter Scott Prize. Personal life. Barry lives in County Wicklow with his wife, the actress Alison Deegan and their three children. "
wikipedia-2336638," Patch cable  A patch cable or patch cord or patch lead is an electrical or optical cable used to connect (""patch-in"") one electronic or optical device to another for routing. Devices of different types (e.g., a switch connected to a computer, or a switch to a router) are connected with patch cords. Patch cords are usually produced in many different colors so as to be easily distinguishable, and are relatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of patch cords include microphone cables, headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny Telephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and ¼"" TRS phone connector cables (as well as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like cords (snake cable) used to carry video or amplified signals. However, patch cords typically refer only to short cords used with patch panels. Patch cords can be as short as 3 inches (ca. 8 cm), to connect stacked components or route signals through a patch bay, or as long as twenty feet (ca. 6 m) or more in length for snake cables. As length increases, the cables are usually thicker and/or made with more shielding, to prevent signal loss (attenuation) and the introduction of unwanted radio frequencies and hum (electromagnetic interference). Patch cords are often made of coaxial cables, with the signal carried through a shielded core, and the electrical ground or earthed return connection carried through a wire mesh surrounding the core. Each end of the cable is attached to a connector so that the cord may be plugged in. Connector types may vary widely, particularly with adapting cables. Patch cords may be: A patch cord is always fitted with connectors at both ends. A pigtail is similar to a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. The non-connectorized end (""the pigtail"") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Music and sound recording. A variety of cables are used to carry electrical signals in sound recording studios and with electronic or electrical musical instruments. Microphones are typically connected to mixing boards or PA systems with XLR microphone cables which use three-pin XLR connectors. A huge range of electric or electronic instruments use 1/4 inch mono patch cords to connect the instrument to the amplifier, such as the electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, electric piano, or electronic drum machine. Musicians playing electric or electronic instruments often use longer cables (from 10 to 20 feet) between their instrument and their amplifier, and then use shorter patch cords (from a few inches to one or two feet long) to connect chains of effects devices, ""stomp box"" pedals, or other signal processors. DJs using record players connect their turntables to mixers or PA systems with stereo RCA connectors. DJs sometimes have to use equipment with multiple cable types, which can create connection difficulties; for example, the DJ's record players and DJ mixers all use RCA connectors, but if they use a drum machine or a bass synthesizer, it may have a 1/4 inch mono connector. To resolve this problem, DJs can either use adapters or special cables (e.g., RCA to 1/4 inch mono). Heavier-gauge cables are used for carrying amplified signals from amplifiers to speakers (both in a PA system and with instrument amplifiers). ¼"" TRS phone connector cables can carry stereo signals, so they are used for stereo headphones and for some patching purposes (e.g., inserting an effect into an insert connection in a mixer).  Music venues, concert halls, and recording studios also use a thicker, hose-like cord called a snake cable (or a ""snake""), which consists of a bundle of many individual cables with patch bays at either end so that audio gear can be connected. The patch bay is a flat panel of audio connectors where XLR cables (often both ""male"" and ""female"") and 1/4 inch jacks can be plugged in. The ""snake"" cable makes setup more convenient, because if a sound engineer did not have a ""snake"", she or he would have to run 20 or 30 individual microphone and instrument cables from the stage to the mixing booth. The cables could get tangled or mixed up, and it would be hard to know, when faced with 20 connectors at the end of the cable run, which cable was associated with which microphone or instrument. The patch bay is numbered, so that the engineer can note which microphone or instrument is plugged into each numbered connection. "
wikipedia-2336647," Fort Mims massacre  The Fort Mims massacre was a battle that occurred on 30 August 1813 during the Creek War, when a force of Creek people, belonging to the ""Red Sticks"" faction under the command of head warriors Peter McQueen and William Weatherford, or Lamochattee (Red Eagle), stormed the fort and defeated the militia garrison. After the defeat of the garrison there ensued a massacre and almost all of the remaining Lower Creek, white settlers, and militia at Fort Mims were killed. The fort was a stockade with a blockhouse surrounding the house and outbuildings of the settler Samuel Mims, located about 35 miles north of present-day Mobile, Alabama. Background. The Creek Nation was splitting into factions during the War of 1812. One group of Creek nativists, the Red Sticks, argued against any more accommodation of the white settlers while the other Creeks favored adopting the white lifestyle. The Red Stick faction of the Creek Indians from the Upper Towns opposed both land cessions to settlers and the Lower Towns' assimilation into European-American culture. The nativists were soon called ""Red Sticks"" because they had raised the ""red stick of war,"" a favored weapon and symbolic Creek war declaration. Civil war among the Creeks erupted in the summer of 1813 and the Red Sticks attacked accommodationist headmen and, in the Upper Towns, began a systematic slaughter of domestic animals, most of which belonged to men who had gained power by adopting aspects of European culture. Not understanding internal issues among the Creek, frontier whites were alarmed about rising tensions and began 'forting up' and moving into the various posts and blockhouses such as Fort Mims while reinforcements were sent to the frontier. American spies learned that Peter McQueen's party of Red Sticks were in Pensacola, Florida to acquire food assistance, supplies and arms from the Spanish. The Creek received from the newly arrived Spanish governor, González Manrique, 45 barrels of corn and flour, blankets, ribbons, scissors, razors, a few steers and 1000 pounds of gunpowder and an equivalent supply of lead musket balls and bird shot, but took and drank no alcohol. When reports of the Creek pack train reached Colonel Caller, he and Major Daniel Beasley of the Mississippi Volunteers led a mounted force of 6 companies 150 white militia riflemen, 30 Tensaw métis under Captain Dixon Bailey to intercept those warriors. They ambushed the Red Sticks in the Battle of Burnt Corn in July 1813 as the Creek were having their mid-day meal. While the United States forces were looting the Red Sticks' pack trains, the warriors returned and successfully drove off the Americans. The United States were now at war with the Creek Nation. In August 1813, Peter McQueen and Red Eagle (Weatherford) were the Red Stick chiefs who would lead the attack on Fort Mims. Creek warriors of the Red Stick faction arranged to concentrate nearly 1,000 men from thirteen Creek towns of the Alabamas, the Tallapoosas, and lower Abekas at the mouth of Flat Creek on the lower Alabama River. The mixed-blood Creek, also known as ""métis"", of Tensaw, one of the Lower Towns, joined European-American settlers for refuge at the stockade of Fort Mims. Both these groups also brought slaves. There were about 517 people, including some 265 armed militia in the fort. Fort Mims was located about 35 to 45 miles (50–70 km) north of Mobile on the eastern side of the Alabama River. Attack. On August 29, 1813, two black slaves tending cattle outside the stockade reported that ""painted warriors"" were in the vicinity. But, mounted scouts from the fort found no signs of the war party. To the detriment of Fort Mims, Beasley had the second slave flogged for ""raising a false alarm"". Beasley received a second warning the morning of the assault by a mounted scout but dismissed it and took no precautions as Beasley was reportedly drunk. Major Beasley, the commander, had claimed that he could ""maintain the post against any number of Indians"", but historians believe the stockade was poorly defended. At the time of the attack, the East gate was partially blocked open by drifting sand. The Red Sticks attacked during the mid-day meal and Beasley had put no pickets or sentries out, dismissing the reports the Creeks were near.  The Creek warriors attempted to take the fort in a ""coup de main"", charging the open gate ""en masse"". At the same time, the Red Sticks took control of the gun loopholes and the outer enclosure. Under Captain Bailey, the militia and settlers held the inner enclosure fighting on for a time and after about two hours there was a pause of about an hour. The Indians, their initial impetus blunted inside the fort and casualties rising, held an impromptu council debating whether to continue the fight or withdraw. By 3 o'clock, it was decided that the Tensaw métis led by Dixon Bailey would have to be destroyed to avenge their treachery at Burnt Corn and then the Creeks launched a second attack at 3 pm. The remaining defenders fell back into a building called the 'bastion'. The Red Sticks set fire to the 'bastion' in the center, which then spread to the rest of the stockade.  The warriors forced their way into the inner enclosure and, despite attempts of Weatherford, killed most of the militia defenders, the mixed-blood Creek, and white settlers. After a struggle of hours, the defense collapsed entirely and perhaps 500 militia, settlers, slaves and Creeks loyal to the Americans died or were captured, with the Red Sticks taking some 250 scalps. By five o'clock, the battle was over and the stockade and buildings sacked and in flames. While they spared the lives of almost all of the slaves, they nonetheless then took over 100 slaves captive. At least 3 women and 10 children are known to have been made captive. Some 36 people, nearly all men, escaped, including Bailey who was mortally wounded, and 2 women and one girl. When a relief column arrived a few weeks later, it found 247 corpses of the defenders and 100 of the Creek attackers. Aftermath and recent history. The Red Sticks' victory at Fort Mims spread panic throughout the Southeastern United States frontier, and settlers demanded governmental action and fled. In the weeks following the battle several thousand persons, about half the population of the Tensaw and Tombigbee districts, would flee their settlements for Mobile and Mobile's population of 500 struggled to accommodate them. The Red Stick victory, one of the greatest achieved by native Americans, and massacre marked the transition from a civil war within the Creek tribe (Muskogee) to a war between the United States and the Red Stick warriors of the Upper Creek. Since Federal troops were occupied with the northern front of the War of 1812, Tennessee, Georgia, and the Mississippi Territory mobilized their militias to move against the Upper Creek towns that had supported the Red Sticks' cause. After several battles, Colonel Andrew Jackson commanded these state militias and together with Cherokee allies at the subsequent Battle of Horseshoe Bend defeated the Red Sticks Creek faction, ending the Creek War. Today the Fort Mims site is maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 1972. The Fort Mims massacre is cited in Margaret Mitchell's epic novel ""Gone with the Wind"". In the book, a minor character, Grandma Fontaine, shares her memories of seeing her entire family murdered in the uprising as a lesson to the protagonist, Scarlett. She explains that a woman should never experience the worst that can happen to her, for then she can never experience fear again. "
wikipedia-2336660," United States Military Standard  A United States defense standard, often called a military standard, ""MIL-STD"", ""MIL-SPEC"", or (informally) ""MilSpecs"", is used to help achieve standardization objectives by the U.S. Department of Defense.  Standardization is beneficial in achieving interoperability, ensuring products meet certain requirements, commonality, reliability, total cost of ownership, compatibility with logistics systems, and similar defense-related objectives [http://www.dsp.dla.mil/APP_UIL/policy.aspx?action=content&accounttype=displaypolicy&contentid=33].  Defense standards are also used by other non-defense government organizations, technical organizations, and industry. This article discusses definitions, history, and usage of defense standards. Related documents, such as defense handbooks and defense specifications, are also addressed. Definition of document types. Although the official definitions differentiate between several types of documents, all of these documents go by the general rubric of ""military standard"", including defense specifications, handbooks, and standards. Strictly speaking, these documents serve different purposes. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), military specifications ""describe the physical and/or operational characteristics of a product"", while military standards ""detail the processes and materials to be used to make the product."" Military handbooks, on the other hand, are primarily sources of compiled information and/or guidance. The GAO acknowledges, however, that the terms are often used interchangeably. Official definitions are provided by DoD 4120.24-M, [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412024m.pdf], ""Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures,"" March 2000, OUSD (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics):  For purposes of this article, ""defense standards"" will include standards, specifications and handbooks. Formats. The DOD has standards about the format of standards: Origins and evolution. Defense standards evolved from the need to ensure proper performance, maintainability and reparability (ease of MRO), and logistical usefulness of military equipment. The latter two goals (MRO and logistics) favor certain general concepts, such as interchangeability, standardization (of equipment and processes, in general), cataloguing, communications, and training (to teach people what is standardized, what is at their discretion, and the details of the standards). In the late 18th century and throughout the 19th, the American and French militaries were early adopters and longtime developmental sponsors and advocates of interchangeability and standardization. By World War II (1939-1945), virtually all national militaries and trans-national alliances of the same (Allied Forces, Axis powers) were busy standardizing and cataloguing. The U.S. AN- cataloguing system (Army-Navy) and the British Defence Standards (DEF-STAN) provide examples.  For example, due to differences in dimensional tolerances, in World War II American screws, bolts, and nuts did not fit British equipment properly and were not fully interchangeable. Defense standards provide many benefits, such as minimizing the number of types of ammunition, ensuring compatibility of tools, and ensuring quality during production of military equipment. This results, for example, in ammunition and food cases that can be opened without tools; vehicle subsystems that can be quickly swapped into the place of damaged ones; and small arms and artillery that are less likely to find themselves with an excess of ammunition that does not fit their bores and a lack of ammo that does.  However, the proliferation of standards also has some drawbacks. The main one is that they impose what is functionally equivalent to a regulatory burden upon the defense supply chain, both within the military and across its civilian suppliers. Almost nothing can be done according to sound case-by-case judgment, and almost everything requires constant, extensive study of the rules and verification that they are being followed ""to a T"". Workflows frequently pause (causing snowballing schedule delays) for reasons that are sometimes essentially trivial, and unit costs rise.  In the U.S. during the 1980s and early 1990s, it was argued that the large number of standards, nearly 30,000 by 1990, imposed unnecessary restrictions, increased cost to contractors (and hence the DOD, since the costs in the end pass along to the customer), and impeded the incorporation of the latest technology. Responding to increasing criticism, Secretary of Defense William Perry issued a memorandum in 1994 that prohibited the use of most defense standards without a waiver. This has become known as the ""Perry memo"". Many defense standards were canceled. In their place, the DOD encouraged the use of industry standards, such as ISO 9000 series for quality assurance (see COTS), SAE standards such as the AS and AMS series (e.g., AS9100, AMS 2404), and others. Weapon systems were required to use ""performance specifications"" that described the desired features and performance of the weapon, as opposed to ""how"" those goals would be reached (that is, exactly which technology and which materials would be used). In 2005 the DOD issued a new memorandum which eliminated the requirement to obtain a waiver in order to use defense standards. The 2005 memo did not reinstate any canceled defense standards. According to a 2003 issue of ""Gateway"", published by the Human Systems Information Analysis Center [http://iac.dtic.mil/hsiac/GW-docs/gw_xiv_2.pdf], the number of defense standards and specifications have been reduced from 45,500 to 28,300. However, other sources noted that the number of standards just before the Perry memorandum was issued was less than 30,000, and that thousands have been canceled since then. This may be due to differences in what is counted as a ""military standard"". Another potential drawback of carrying standardization to an extreme is a threat analogous to monoculture (where lack of biodiversity creates higher risk of pandemic disease) or a ship without bulkhead compartmentalization (where even a small hull leak threatens to fill the whole vessel). If an enemy discovers a drawback in a standardized system, the system's uniformity leaves it vulnerable to complete incapacitation via what might otherwise have been a limited compromise. (See Security through obscurity which may be considered poor practice via the U.S. Navy KISS principle.) Also, materiel overrun by advancing enemy lines is potentially easier for the enemy to make use of if it is extensively standardized; but this threat is somewhat academic, as even poorly standardized materiel presents a likelihood of supplying an enemy if overrun.

wikipedia-2336683," Tim Floyd  Tim Floyd (born February 25, 1954) is an American college basketball coach and the current head coach of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) Miners men's basketball team. He is also a former head coach of several teams in both the NCAA and the NBA, most recently the University of Southern California men's college basketball team. Floyd is also known as the coach of the Chicago Bulls after Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman left the team. Personal life. Born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Floyd is a 1977 graduate of Louisiana Tech University where he earned a bachelor's of science degree in health and physical education. He originally was a walk-on player at the University of Southern Mississippi, but he transferred to Louisiana Tech and was a scholarship player there. His father, who was also a coach, died when Floyd was 18. Floyd and wife Beverly have one daughter, Shannon. Coaching career. University of Texas at El Paso. Floyd's first coaching job was as an assistant at UTEP under Hall of Famer Don Haskins from 1977 to 1986. While Floyd was at UTEP, the Miners went to three straight NCAA Tournaments (from 1984 to 1986). They also went to the NIT three times (in 1980, 1981, and 1983), and UTEP won four Western Athletic Conference championships in those years. University of Idaho. Tim Floyd's first assignment as a head coach came at the University of Idaho, succeeding Bill Trumbo, who finished last in the Big Sky conference in each of his three seasons. Floyd coached the Vandals for two years. In his first season, the Vandals posted their first winning record since Don Monson left for Oregon after the 20-9 1983 season. University of New Orleans. At the University of New Orleans, Floyd tallied a 127–58 mark in six seasons as head coach. During his tenure, UNO advanced to postseason play five times, including two NCAA Tournament appearances in 1991 and 1993 and the NIT three times. At UNO, Floyd averaged 21 wins a season. Floyd is one of only four Division I coaches who have won four conference championships in the first five years at their school. In his final season at New Orleans in 1994, the team finished 20-10. Floyd reached the 20-win plateau for the sixth time in eight seasons, and UNO made its seventh postseason appearance in eight years. Iowa State University. Floyd was hired at Iowa State University in May 1994 as the 15th basketball coach in ISU history. In his four years at ISU, Floyd posted an 81-49 record. He is the only coach in Iowa State history to post three consecutive 20-win seasons. He also led the team to three straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament and three straight first-round victories. In his first season with the Cyclones, Floyd guided the team to a then-school-record 23 victories and the second round of the NCAA Tournament. During that season, the Cyclones were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll for 11 consecutive weeks, peaking at number eleven. Four of the eleven ISU losses were to 1995 NCAA Final Four teams. The Cyclones returned to the Big Eight Conference Tournament championship for the first time since 1986. In addition, during the 1995 season, Fred Hoiberg became the first Cyclone to earn All-American honors since Jeff Grayer in 1988. Picked in preseason polls to finish last in the Big Eight, the 1995-96 Cyclones finished second in the league with a 9-5 mark and won the Big Eight Conference Tournament with a win over the Kansas Jayhawks, then ranked the number five team in the nation. The Cyclones received the highest NCAA Tournament seed in school history. As the number five seed, the Cyclones defeated the California Bears but lost to the Utah Utes, then coached by Rick Majerus (who, in 2004, accepted and immediately resigned from the USC head coaching job that later went to Floyd). Iowa State's 24 victories that season was a school record. For his coaching efforts, Floyd was named Big Eight Coach of the Year and runner-up to Gene Keady of Purdue University for AP National Coach of the Year. In the 1996-1997 season, with high expectations and a national ranking as high as number four, Floyd and the Cyclones posted a 22-9 mark and advanced to their first NCAA Sweet Sixteen appearance in 11 years. In the NCAA Tournament, the sixth-seeded Cyclones defeated the Illinois State Redbirds in the first round and the Cincinnati Bearcats before losing to the UCLA Bruins in overtime in a game they led by double digits most of the game. Floyd was also responsible for landing would-be recruits, including Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich, who would later withdraw their verbal commitments upon Floyd's departure from Iowa State. While at Iowa State, Floyd coached future pros Dedric Willoughby, Fred Hoiberg (now the current head coach at Iowa State), Kelvin Cato, Marcus Fizer and Paul Shirley. Chicago Bulls. On July 23, 1998, Floyd was hired head coach of the Chicago Bulls of the NBA. That off-season, the core of the Bulls championship teams retired or left, leaving the equivalent of an expansion team. During the lockout season of 1998-1999, the team posted a record of 13–37. The next season, the Bulls had a 17-65 record. The team continued to regress, posting a 15–67 record in the 2000-2001 season. His fourth year as coach was marred by fights with players and management. Floyd resigned on December 24, 2001 after a 4–21 start. In his four seasons with the Bulls, Floyd posted a record of 49–190. The team did not make the NBA Playoffs in any of those years. Known as a favorite of Jerry Krause by the Chicago media, an entertaining press conference had Floyd proclaim not ""Jerry's boy."" New Orleans Hornets. As head coach of the New Orleans Hornets in 2003-2004, Floyd posted a 41-41 record, despite the mid-season loss of Hornets star Jamal Mashburn. The Hornets lost in the first round of the playoffs, taking the Miami Heat the full seven games. Ownership was dissatisfied and dismissed Floyd after just one season. Floyd ended his NBA career with a 93-235 overall record, including the playoffs, admitting in interviews that, as an NBA coach, ""I wasn't very good at it"". It was announced on November 12, 2009 that Floyd would be rejoining the Hornets as a top assistant to head coach and General Manager Jeff Bower. University of Southern California. On January 14, 2005, Floyd was hired as head coach of the USC Trojans, replacing interim coach Jim Saia who filled in after the school fired coach Henry Bibby. USC had originally hired Rick Majerus on December 15, 2004, however he unexpectedly resigned five days later. Floyd was the Trojans' immediate next choice. Floyd's initial season may be regarded as a success. The 2005–06 Trojans finished the regular season with a 17–12 (8–10) record and sixth place in the Pacific-10 Conference (""Pac-10""), including three conference losses by a combined nine points. Floyd was the subject of heightened media attention in October 2006, when 14-year-old high school freshman Dwayne Polee Jr., son of former NBA player Dwayne Polee, verbally accepted a scholarship offer from Floyd. Polee Jr. had yet to play in a high school basketball game. For the 2006–2007 season, Floyd led the Trojans to a 25–12 (13–8) record (most wins in school history) and third place in the Pac-10. He also led this team to finals of the Pacific Life Pac-10 Tournament, where they lost to Oregon. Floyd took the Trojans to the 2007 NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16, only the second USC team to do so since 1979. However, USC lost to number one seeded UNC on March 23, 2007. In the 2008 NCAA Tournament, the #6 seeded Trojans fell 80-67 to the #11 seed Kansas State Wildcats in the first round. Floyd's Trojans won the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament by defeating Arizona State, then made it to the second round of the 2009 NCAA Tournament, losing to eventual runner-up Michigan State. This marked the first time the Trojans had made a third consecutive NCAA tournament. After USC's exit from the tournament, Floyd was offered the vacant coaching position at Arizona but turned it down. The off-season immediately following the 2009 tournament proved to be tumultuous for Floyd and the USC program: Key starters DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett all declared for the NBA draft on the same day. Floyd was accused of providing improper benefits by handing cash to Los Angeles event promoter Rodney Guillory, one of the handlers for O. J. Mayo, to influence the then-high school star to choose USC, resulting in an NCAA investigation. Due to the NCAA investigation and academic issues, several key recruits decommitted or chose different universities. After Marcus Johnson, who played only 16 games for USC, averaging 3.6 points, opted to turn professional, Floyd lamented to a gathering of boosters: ""Kansas has two players who would have been NBA lottery picks, Cole Aldrich and Sherron Collins, and they are returning to school. Good for them. Our guys get an offer from Islamabad and they're gone."" Claiming to have lost enthusiasm for his job, Floyd resigned as the head coach of USC on June 9, 2009. Floyd first notified a paper in his home state of Mississippi; his resignation was accepted by USC, which was faced with looking for a replacement late in the off-season. Following an internal investigation, USC vacated its 21 wins from the 2007-08 season and withdrew from postseason consideration (including the Pac-10 tournament) for the 2009-10 season. Return to University of Texas at El Paso. On March 30, 2010, UTEP announced the hiring of Tim Floyd. Floyd replaced Tony Barbee who left to take a head coach job at Auburn. Controversy. O. J. Mayo. ""Tim Floyd, who brought respectability on the court and controversy off it to the Southern California basketball program, resigned Tuesday. Floyd stepped down a month after a published report that he gave $1,000 in cash to the man who acted as a go-between when star player O.J. Mayo decided to attend USC and play his freshman season at the school."" "

Valparaiso career. Drew graduated from Butler University in 1993 with a bachelor's degree in liberal arts. While at Butler he was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. Although he never played high school basketball at the varsity level, Drew spent two years as a student assistant for the men's basketball team. Afterwards, Drew assumed an assistant coaching position with the Valparaiso University Crusaders men's team under his father Homer Drew. He spent nine years in this position, during which he earned a master's degree from Valparaiso and a reputation as one of the best recruiters in the nation. Once the elder Drew retired, he became the team's head coach for one year. In that year, Valparaiso won the regular season conference championship, but lost to IUPUI in the Mid-Continent Conference tournament, thus losing the bid to the NCAA tournament. However, the team proceeded to earn an NIT bid. When Drew went to Baylor, his father came out of retirement to coach Valpo. Baylor career. On August 22, 2003, Drew took the head coaching position of the men's team at Baylor University after the resignation of Dave Bliss due to scandal. Drew took over the team in August, unusually late for a coaching change, and most of Baylor's top players from the previous year had chosen to transfer. Drew took over a program left in a shambles as a result of the scandal. Besides losing most of its top players, the program was put on probation until 2010, and had paid scholarships and paid recruiting visits reduced until 2007. Post season play was also cancelled for the 2003–04 season, and only conference games were permitted for the 2005–06 season. With these handicaps, Drew led the Bears to an 8–21 record in the 2003–04 season, 9–19 in the 2004–05 season, and 4–13 in the conference-only 2005–06 season. In the 2007–08 season, Drew turned around his Bears to finish with a 21–9 regular season record and 9–7 Big 12 record, and rank 4th in the Big 12. The 21 wins and 9 conference wins were Baylor's best since joining the Big 12 in 1996. It was enough to make the NCAA Tournament for only the fifth time in school history and the first time since 1988. At the end of the regular season, when Drew made an appearance on the sports show PTI, host Tony Kornheiser suggested on the air that Drew be voted ""unanimous coach of the year"". After the season, Drew signed a 10-year contract extension to stay the head coach of the Bears. Prior to the 2008–09 season, a Rivals.com writer called Drew the Big 12 ""coach on the rise"", due to Drew's success in recruiting talent to Baylor. The Big 12 coaches picked Drew's squad to finish 4th in the conference. In 2010, after finishing tied for second in the Big 12 with a squad picked to finish tenth in the preseason poll, Scott Drew was elected the Austin American Statesman's Coach of the Year award. That year he went on to beat the Longhorns 3 straight times in 2010. He went on in the same year to enjoy a NCAA sweet 16 birth making he and his father Homer Drew one of the few father and son coaches to accomplish such feat. Then he went one step further and made an Elite 8 appearance eventually losing to the national championship winning Duke Blue Devils. In 2011, Drew led Baylor to a 18–13 overall record and an seventh-place finish in the Big 12. In the first round of the Big 12 Conference Tournament, Baylor lost to the 14–17 Oklahoma Sooners 84–67. Hours before the game, Baylor was informed that star player Perry Jones III would not be allowed to play, which was later admitted to be a mistake after national outrage against the NCAA. Baylor was expected to be even more improved in 2011–12. The Bears started the season 17–0 and rising to third in the AP Poll and the coaches' poll—the highest weekly rankings in school history. However Baylor would finish on a 13-8 run in their last 21 games and finishing in a tie for third in the Big XII. In the NCAA Tournament, an Elite Eight loss to Kentucky marked the second time in three seasons that the Bears' season ended at the hands of the eventual national champions.20-13 Season, Baylor failed to get an invitational back to the NCAA Tournament, but accepted a bid to the NIT. They would later go on to win it. "
wikipedia-2336743," Sultanpur district  Sultanpur District (, ) is a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. The district is a part of Faizabad Division. Its administrative head is Sultanpur. History. One incident worthy of note in the 19th century history of the district since the British annexation of Oudh is the revolt of the native troops stationed at Sultanpur during the Sepoy Mutiny. The troops rose in rebellion on the 9 June 1857, and, after murdering two of their officers, sacked the station. Upon the restoration of order, Sultanpur cantonment was strengthened by a detachment of British troops; but in 1861 it was entirely abandoned as a military station. Geography. It has an area of . The surface is generally level, being broken only by ravines in the neighborhood of the rivers. The central portion is highly cultivated, while in the south are widespread arid plains and swampy ""jhils"" or marshes. The principal river is the Gomti River, which passes through the centre of the district and affords a valuable highway for commerce. Minor streams are the Kandu, Pili, Tengha and Nandhia; their channels form the outlet for the superfluous water of the jhils, draining into the Sai. Due to its plain fertile land and irrigation facilities, it has got an agricultural importance. Primarily an agricultural district, its principal crops are rice, pulses, wheat, barley, sugarcane and a little poppy. Economy. Jagdishpur is the main industrial area in the district with BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited), Indo gulf (urea factory) and some leather factories established in that area. Apart from these the district also has Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) testing centre located in Korwa near Munshiganj and ACC cement factory in Gauriganj. The main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Lucknow to Rae Bareli and Mughal Sarai serves the south-western portion. Politically the district is noted for its Amethi constituency due to its association with Gandhi family. Demographics. According to the 2011 census Sultanpur district has a population of 3,790,922, roughly equal to the nation of Liberia or the US state of Oregon.

wikipedia-2336777," Henry Jackson Society  The Henry Jackson Society is a British think tank. The think tank has been described as neoconservative although the society has never used such terms to describe itself. The society is named after Henry M. Jackson, the late Democratic Senator and anticommunist defense hawk. Originating within the University of Cambridge, the organisation is now based in London. In April 2011 all the staff of another London think-tank, the Centre for Social Cohesion (which has since been dissolved), joined the Henry Jackson Society.  History and political aims. The society was founded in March 2005 by academics and students at Cambridge (mostly affiliated with the Centre for International Studies), including Brendan Simms, Alan Mendoza, Gideon Mailer, James Rogers and Matthew Jamison. It organises meetings with speakers in the House of Commons. The society advocates for an interventionist foreign-policy that promotes human rights and reduces suffering, by both non-military and military methods, when appropriate. In 2006, the society worked to raise the profile of the Ahwazi Arabs of Iran, who it claims are presently being oppressed by the Iranian regime.

wikipedia-2336787," Education in London  London is a leading global educational centre, having one of the largest populations of overseas students of any city in the world. Universities. London has the largest student population of any British city, although not the highest per capita. Universities in London may be divided into two groups: First, the federal University of London, which, with over 120,000 students, is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom (smaller only than the distance-education Open University) and one of the largest Universities in Europe. It comprises 19 colleges and 12 institutes, as well as a distance-learning External System. Constituent colleges have a high degree of autonomy, controlling their own admissions and degree programmes, and are effectively universities in their own right. The largest and most well-known University of London colleges include (in order of size) University College London, Birkbeck, King's College London, Queen Mary, the London School of Economics and Political Science, Royal Holloway, Goldsmiths, and the Institute of Education. Smaller schools and institutes (with fewer than 5,000 students) include the School of Oriental and African Studies, the London Business School, the School of Pharmacy, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, St. George's Hospital Medical School and Central School of Speech and Drama. Traditionally all of the University of London institutions awarded degrees from the University of London itself, and not from the individual college or institution, but this changed in 2007/2008 when King's College London, the London School of Economics, University College London and the Institute of Education remained within the University of London system, but began awarding their own degrees. Imperial College London was a part of the University of London until 2007, but is now a separate institution. Secondly, there are other universities not part of the University of London, most of which were polytechnics until UK polytechnics were granted university status by a 1992 Act of Parliament. Among these are the University of Westminster, London South Bank University, University of Greenwich, City University, London, Middlesex University, London Metropolitan University , Brunel University, University of West London, the University of East London, and various other higher education institutions. Research. Imperial College London, LSE and UCL are leading centres of research and stand alongside MIT, Berkeley, Princeton, Yale and other US universities in terms of international reputation. All or virtually all of the leading British learned societies are based in London. The Royal Institution is a historic and important repository and proponent of the acquisition of scientific knowledge through research and study. Other institutions of higher education. There are also number off firms and colleges in London which provide education and consultation leading to degrees validated by universities, but which are not actual universities themselves. Some of these colleges are private institutions very similar to actual universities, such as European Business School, London School of Business and Management and Regent's College. Further education. London also has many further education colleges funded by the Learning and Skills Council. Traditionally these were clearly separated from the higher education system, and offered vocational education below university level, but this distinction is breaking down and many further education colleges now offer university level courses validated by a local university and prepare students for university entrance, as well as providing vocational courses. Arts education. London is Britain's leading centre for arts education. London's four music conservatories are the Royal College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music, Trinity College of Music, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Other drama schools include Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (""RADA""), and the Central School of Speech and Drama. Art & Design schools include Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Chelsea College of Art and Design, Camberwell College of Arts, Wimbledon School of Art and London College of Communication and London College of Fashion (all part of the University of the Arts London), and Goldsmiths College, University of London and the Slade School of Art (both part of the University of London), and the Royal College of Art. The former Hornsey College of Art is now part of Middlesex University. The University of East London has an Institute for Performing Arts Development - IPAD. Medical education. London is an important centre of medical education. The city's medical schools are attached to the leading hospitals and some of them are several centuries old. The number of schools has been reduced to five by a recent series of mergers: Schools. Public schools in Greater London include Harrow, City of London School, University College School, Westminster, Highgate School, St Paul's School and The American School in London. "
wikipedia-2336822," Rain-in-the-Face  Rain-in-the-Face (Lakota: Ité Omáǧažu (in Standard Lakota Orthography) (c. 1835 – September 15, 1905) was a warchief of the Lakota tribe of Native Americans. His mother was a Dakota related to the band of famous Chief Inkpaduta. He was among the Indian leaders who defeated George Armstrong Custer and the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment at the 1876 Battle of Little Big Horn. Biography. Born in the Dakota Territory near the forks of the Cheyenne River about 1835, Rain-in-the-Face was from the Hunkpapa band within the Lakota nation. His name may have been a result of a fight when he was a boy in which his face was splattered like rain with his Cheyenne adversary's blood. Late in his life, the chief related that the name was reinforced by an incident when he was a young man where he was in a battle in a heavy rainstorm with a band of Gros Ventres. At the end of the lengthy combat, his face was streaked with war paint. He first fought against the whites in the summer of 1866 when he participated in a raid against Fort Totten in what is now North Dakota. In 1868, he again fought the U.S. Army in the Fetterman massacre near Fort Phil Kearny in present-day Wyoming. He again was on the warpath in 1873 when he took part in the Battle of Honsinger Bluff where he ambushed and killed an army veterinarian Dr. John Honsinger, an army Private and another civilian near present day Miles City, Montana. He returned to the Standing Rock Reservation, but was arrested by Captain Thomas Custer in 1874 on orders of General George A. Custer for the murder of Honsinger. He was taken to Fort Abraham Lincoln and incarcerated. However, he escaped (or was freed by sympathetic Indian policemen) and returned to the reservation, then fled to the Powder River. In the spring of 1876, he joined Sitting Bull's band and traveled with him to the Little Big Horn River in early June. During the subsequent fighting at the Battle of Little Big Horn on Custer Hill on June 25, 1876, Rain-in-the-Face is alleged to have cut the heart out of Thomas Custer, a feat that was popularized by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in ""The Revenge of Rain in the Face"". According to the dubious legend, Rain-in-the-Face was fulfilling a vow of vengeance because he thought Captain Thomas Custer had unjustly imprisoned him in 1874. Some contemporary accounts also claimed that the war chief had personally dispatched George Custer as well, but in the confused fighting, a number of similar claims have been attributed to other warriors. Late in his life, in a conversation with writer Charles Eastman, Rain-in-the-Face denied killing George Custer or mutilating Tom Custer. Rain-in-the-Face joined other Hunkpapa as they fled north into Canada, spending the next several years in exile. He finally led his band in to surrender in 1880 and was transferred to the Standing Rock Agency the following year. In a census of the Lakota taken at Standing Rock in September 1881, Rain in the Face's band is recorded as numbering 39 families or 180 people. Rain-in-the-Face died in his home at the Bullhead Station on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota after a lengthy illness. On his deathbed he reputedly confessed to a missionary that he thought that he might have killed Custer, shooting him from so close as to leave powder marks upon his face. "

wikipedia-2336830," Spangdahlem Air Base  Spangdahlem Air Base (IATA:SPM, ICAO: ETAD, former code EDAD) is a United States Air Force base located near the small German town of Spangdahlem, approximately 30 km NNE of the city of Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate. Units. Spangdahlem is home of the 52d Fighter Wing, which maintains, deploys and employs Lockheed Martin Block 50 F-16CJ and Republic A/OA-10 aircraft and TPS-75 radar systems in support of NATO and the national defense directives. The commander of the 52d Fighter Wing is Colonel David J. Julazadeh. In total, 4,800 military personnel, 840 German nationals and 200 US contractors are working at the base. The 52nd Maintenance. Group consists of four squadrons: The 52nd Mission Support. Group consists of civil engineer, communications, contracting, logistics readiness, security forces and force support squadrons: The 52nd Medical Group. Consists of aerospace medicine, dental, medical operations and medical support squadrons: The 52nd Munitions Maintenance Group. Provides four fully capable U.S. munitions support squadrons responsible for the ownership, custody, accountability and release of war reserve munitions supporting Belgian, Dutch, German and Italian air forces: The wing supports the Supreme Allied Commander Europe with mission-ready personnel and systems providing expeditionary air power. The wing also supports contingencies and operations other than war. Air Mobility Command. In addition, Air Mobility Command supports cargo and passenger traffic as part of its airlift mission. With the closure of the Rhein-Main Air Base in 2005, the Rhein-Main Transition Program was initiated to transfer all its former transport capacities to Ramstein Air Base (70%) and Spangdahlem AB (30%). The Air Mobility Command 726th Air Mobility Squadron at Spangdahlem supports cargo and passenger traffic as part of its airlift mission, providing command and control, maintenance and aerial port capability to all AMC aircraft transiting their ramp. The 726th AMS utilizes various aircraft maintenance equipment, de-icers, mission vehicles and aircraft loaders. The squadron is capable of handling every type of aircraft in the AMC inventory, from C-17s and C-5s to KC-10s and KC-135s. In November 2005, the first C-17 Globemaster III aircraft arrived at Spangdahlem. History. Spangdahlem Air Base has been a military presence in Germany for over five decades. With the creation of NATO in response to Cold War tensions in Europe, USAFE wanted its vulnerable fighter units in West Germany moved west of the Rhein River to provide greater air defense warning time. France agreed to provide air base sites within their zone of occupation in the Rheinland-Palatinate as part of the NATO expansion program. The base was constructed between 1951 and 1953 at a cost of roughly $27,000,000 using French and German contractors, working under the supervision of a French government agency. The initial USAF military presence began on 1 September 1952 with the arrival of the 7352d Air Base Squadron on 1 September 1952 from Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base near Munich. The mission of the 7532d ABS was to prepare the facility for an operational wing. 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. On 10 May 1953 the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was reassigned to Spangdahlem AB from Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France. The base population at this time totaled slightly more than 1,900 personnel. Operational squadrons of the 10th TRW were: Upon its arrival at Spangdahlem AB, the 10 TRW operated Lockheed RF-80A Shooting Star for daylight aerial recon and the Douglas RB-26C Invader for night recon missions. The RB-26s were replaced in October 1954 by Martin RB-57A Canberras and the RF-80s in July 1955 by Republic Aviation RF-84F Thunderjets. In 1957 the RB-57s and RF-84s were transferred to Chateauroux-Deols Air Depot and the 1st and 38th were re-equipped with the Douglas RB-66 Destroyer. Three additional squadrons, the 19th and 30th (8 January 1958) and 42d Tactical Reconnaissance (8 December 1957) were assigned to the 10th TRW from the 66th TRW,(Sembach AB), flying variants of the RB-66. The 19th TRS operated from RAF Sculthorpe united Kingdom during 1958, moving to Spangdahlem in 1959. The 42nd TRS flew from RAF Chelveston and remained there as a detachment of the 10th TRW. On 25 August 1959, the 10th TRW ended its six-year stay at Spangdahlem and moved to RAF Alconbury, United Kingdom. 49th Tactical Fighter Wing. On 25 August 1959, the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Spangdahlem AB from the Etain-Rouvres Air Base, France, and assumed host unit duties. In 1957, the French Government decreed that all nuclear weapons and delivery aircraft had to be removed from French soil. As a result, the nuclear-capable North American F-100C/D Super Sabres of the 49th TFW had to be removed from France. Squadrons of the 49th TFW at Spangdahlem were (squadron tail colour stripe): The 49th TFW flew F-100s until 1961 when it converted to the Republic F-105D/F Thunderchief, commonly known as the ""Thud"". The 49th TFW was only the third USAF unit to operate the F-105. The 49th received two Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards for F-105 operations at Spangdahlem. On 9 March 1967, the Wing began receiving the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II. The 49 TFW remained at Spangdahlem AB until 1 July 1968 when it relocated to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, to serve as the US Air Force’s first dual-based, NATO-committed wing. The 38 TRS was never equipped with RB-66B models. When the 10 TRW re-equipped with the RB-66 the 38 TRS and the 32 TRS moved away from Spangdahlem (to France I believe) and re-equipped with RF-101s. The 1, 19, 30, and the 42 TRS remained at Spangdahlem until their move to the UK. The 1, 19, and 30 TRS flew the RB-66B and the 42 TRS flew the RB-66C and WB-66D. This movement of squadrons came about due to the introduction of the AFM 66-1 combined maintenance concept. It was decided to keep aircraft of one general type in the same units for maintenance and supply considerations. Fighter units got the RF-101 and bomber units got the RB-66 and these units combined accordingly. 7149th/36th Tactical Fighter Wing. With the departure of the 49 TFW, the 7149th Air Base Group was activated to serve as a caretaker unit for a number of support organizations that remained behind after the departure of the 49 TFW. Although it did not have any assigned aircraft, the 7149 TFW would have served as a nucleus on which to build if the 49 TFW had been ordered to return to Europe to bolster NATO air forces. On 1 January 1969, the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing, located at nearby Bitburg Air Base, assumed operational control of Spangdahlem, becoming a dual-based wing. Squadrons from the 36 TFW assigned to Spangdahlem were: The 23 TFS carried out tactical fighter training missions, while the 39 TEWS was a deployed squadron from Shaw AFB, South Carolina to conduct electronic warfare missions and train tactical reconnaissance and electronic warfare crews in Europe. 52d Tactical Fighter Wing. On 31 December 1971 the 52d Tactical Fighter Wing was transferred without personnel or equipment from Suffolk County AFB, New York to Spangdahlem. Upon activation in Germany, the 52 TFW assumed control of the two squadrons the 36 TFW had located at Spangdahlem: The 39 TEWS returned to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina on 1 January 1973. In turn, it was replaced in the electronic warfare role by the 81st Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying the McDonnell Douglas EF-4C Phantom II, being transferred to Spangdahlem from Zweibrücken Air Base, Germany under project ""Creek Action"" on 15 January 1973. The 52 TFW gained its third fighter squadron with the activation of the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 15 November 1976. On 1 January 1977, the 52 TFW had the following operational squadrons: In 1979, the more capable Wild Weasel F-4G had replaced the EF-4Cs of the 81 TFS, and in 1980 through 1982, F-4Es replaced the F-4Ds of the 23d and 480th TFSs. A complete reorganization of wing aircraft and aircrews occurred in November 1983, transforming the 52d TFW into the first and only all-defense suppression wing outside of the United States. Under this configuration, each of the wing’s three fighter squadrons flew E and G model F-4s paired together into Wild Weasel ""hunter/killer"" teams capable of locating and destroying enemy radar-guided, surface-to-air threats in all weather. In April 1987, the 52d began changing with the times and replaced its aging Phantoms with Block 30/32 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons for the 23d and 480th TFSs. These were later replaced with Block 50 versions beginning in 1993. The last USAF operational model F-4E Phantom II aircraft departed Spangdahlem AB in December 1987. In late 1990, the 81st TFS reorganized to exclusively fly the F-4G, then deployed 24 aircraft to Sheikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain for Operation Desert Storm combat operations. 52nd Fighter Wing On 1 October 1991, the 52 TFW was redesignated the 52d Fighter Wing as part of a sweeping, Air Force-wide restructure. The 510th Fighter Squadron was moved to Spangdahlem with the closure of RAF Bentwaters United Kingdom on 4 January 1993 as the lone A-10 Thunderbolt II squadron in USAFE. Also in early 1993, the 81st FS was reorganized to fly a mixture of F-4Gs and Block 30 F-16C/Ds.  The F-4Gs were withdrawn and sent to AMARC in February 1994. With the withdrawal of the Phantoms, the 510th Fighter Squadron was replaced by the 81st FS at Spangdahlem and was transferred to Ramstein Air Base to absorb the F-16 assets of the 512th FS there. In February 1994, the 53d Fighter Squadron relocated to Spangdahlem from Bitburg after its closure with F-15C/Ds. The 480 FS was also inactivated during October 1994, being replaced by the 22d Fighter Squadron from Bitburg. The 606th Air Control Squadron was also assigned to the 52d Fighter Wing but remained at Bitburg until September 1995 before moving to Spangdahlem. After the restructuring and the closure of Bitburg and transfer of 36 FW squadrons to Spangdahlem, the operational squadrons of the 52d Fighter Wing were: The 52d made history in 1997 with its first-ever deployment to a former Warsaw Pact nation. In September the 52d participated in EAGLE’S TALON-97, the first bilateral exercise involving US and Polish Air Forces. Units from the 52d deployed under the air expeditionary force (AEF) doctrine and formed the 52nd Combined Air and Space Expeditionary Wing, operating out of Powidz AB, Krzesiny AB, and Poznan, Poland. During the second quarter of FY 99, the 52nd witnessed the inactivation of the 53rd Fighter Squadron. The 53d had called Spangdahlem Air Base home since February 1994 when the squadron moved from Bitburg Air Base. As the squadron prepared for its inactivation in March 1999, all of the F-15s were transferred to the 1 FW at Langley AFB, Virginia, or to the 48 FW at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom. In April 2010, the wing's strength was reduced by one third. 20 F-16Cs were flown to the 148th Fighter Wing, Minnesota Air National Guard and one F-16 was transferred to Edwards Air Force Base, California. All aircraft were from the 22nd Fighter Squadron. As a result of the drawdown of F-16s, the 22nd and 23rd Fighter Squadrons were inactivated on 13 August 2010 and formed a single ""new"" squadron, the 480th Fighter Squadron. In February 2012, it was announced that the 81st Fighter Squadron will be inactivated in 2013, leaving the 52nd Fighter ""Wing"" with just one squadron. Fiscal reductions have led observers to predict that Spangdahlem will soon close.  "
wikipedia-2336839," Culture of London  The Culture of London concerns the arts, music, museums, festivals and other entertainment in London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. London is widely believed to be the culture capital of the world, although this title is disputed with a number of other cities internationally. The city is particularly renowned for its theatre quarter, and its West End theatre district has given the name to ""West End theatre"", the strand of mainstream professional theatre staged in the large theatres in London. London is also home to notable cultural attractions such as the British Museum, the Tate Galleries, the National Gallery, the Notting Hill Carnival and The O2. A variety of landmarks and objects are cultural icons associated with London, such as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the tube map. Many other British cultural icons are strongly associated with London in the minds of visiting tourists, including the red telephone box, the routemaster bus, the black taxi and the Union Flag. The city is home to many nationalities and the diversity of cultures have shaped the city's culture over time. Classical music/Opera. The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), the Philharmonia and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

The major venues for contemporary dance productions include the Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Barbican Centre. Popular music. London is famous for its rock scene, and was the starting point of some of the greatest 60s and 70s band such as Iron Maiden, The Clash, Led Zeppelin, The Sex Pistols, The Who, Pink Floyd, Queen and very popular 90s bands like Blur, Coldplay, Radiohead, and Oasis that are still very popular to this day. Most major bands' tours will pass through London as well, favourite venues being the Brixton Academy, the London Astoria, and the Hammersmith Apollo. In addition to spawning the bands mentioned above, London, in its capacity as the UK's cultural centre, has served as the base of a number of internationally important acts, including David Bowie, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, as well as being instrumental in the birth of dance music. London also has a thriving urban scene, mainly throughout the 21st century. Soul singers like Adele, Amy Winehouse, Joss Stone and Lemar have found themselves chart, and international success.

In addition to Tate Modern major contemporary art venues include White Cube, the Saatchi Gallery, and The ICA. Museums and art galleries. London is home to over 240 museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. Also of eighteenth-century foundation is the Royal Academy of Arts; its summer exhibition has been an annual fixture on the London social calendar since 1769. In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of South Kensington was developed as ""Albertopolis"", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied and Decorative arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station. London's museums of military and maritime history also opened in the twentieth century: the Imperial War Museum in 1917, and the National Maritime Museum in 1934. London has several smaller museums of note. The Dulwich Picture Gallery was the first purpose-built public art gallery in England, opening in 1817. Its architect, Sir John Soane, turned his own house in Lincoln's Inn Fields into a museum and architectural showcase, known as the Soane Museum.

wikipedia-2336882," Edward Elric  , commonly nicknamed , is a fictional character and the protagonist of the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" anime and manga series created by Hiromu Arakawa. Edward, titled , is the youngest State Alchemist in the history of the fictional country of Amestris. His left leg was mystically severed in a failed attempt to resurrect his dead mother, his right arm taken in the exchange for his brother's soul. His missing limbs have been replaced with sophisticated prosthetics called ; he and his younger brother, Alphonse Elric, scour the world in search of the Philosopher's Stone in the hopes of restoring their bodies. Ed has appeared in other media from the series, including video games, original video animations (OVAs) and light novels. Numerous publications in various media have been written on the subject of Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as the best moments in the series. His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures. Appearances. Edward Elric is the youngest State Alchemist to be selected by the State Military of the country, receiving the title of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" shortly thereafter from military head, King Bradley. He and his younger brother, Alphonse, seek to obtain the legendary Philosopher's Stone in order to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy. Edward was born in a small town named Resembool, where he lived with Alphonse and his parents, Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim. After Hohenheim left the family on a journey early in his sons' lives, and Trisha died of an illness years later, the two young boys concentrated on studying alchemy in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life, and trained with a skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis. The two's attempt to revive their mother failed, costing Edward his left leg, and Alphonse his entire body. Edward then performed a second transmutation, sacrificing his own right arm to bind Alphonse's soul to a nearby suit of armor. In order to move without his lost limbs, Edward has had prosthetic ""automail"" limbs designed and implemented by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell. Winry is often kept busy repairing Edward's automail, as he regularly breaks and damages the machines during heavy bouts. As the series continues, the two progressively develop a romantic relationship, eventually confessing their feelings to each other by the series' end. Edward's motivation stems from a love for his brother, Alphonse, whom he is desperately seeking to restore to human form after their mistake. He is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of ""Equivalent Exchange,"" which states that every outcome requires an equal payment. Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height, tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject, usually attacking people in a fit of rage. Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles, Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting his hands as a result of his failed human transmutation which gave him such trait. In addition to this, Edward is a formidable fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in martial arts. During their search for the Stone, they become the targets of Scar, a vengeful Ishbalan, and the immortal creatures known as the homunculi. When Edward and Alphonse discover that the homunculi and the Philosopher's Stone are related, they work together with their comrades in order to find them. However, after the Elric brothers meet the homunculi's creator, ""Father,"" they are forced to keep working with the military by high-ranking officials who are secretly using their friends from Resembool as hostages. Unable to protect their friends, the Elrics travel to the northern area of the country in order to request help from General Olivier Mira Armstrong. Shortly after their arrival, the State Alchemist Solf J. Kimblee takes Winry to the north as a hostage, unknown to Winry, in order to force Edward to continue his work. When the brothers are ordered to capture Scar, they end up using his help to move Winry to a safe place. Upon their success, Edward learns when Father plans to make a human transmutation circle out of the entire country. Edward, Alphonse, and their allies thus unite in an effort to bring down Father. They make their way into the underground complex where Edward is to be used as a sacrifice for Father's transmutation. While battling Father, Edward loses his automail arm, rendering him unable to perform alchemy. Alphonse transmutes his soul in order to restore Edward's original flesh-and-blood arm. After defeating Father, Edward manages to restore Alphonse to his original body by sacrificing his own ability to use alchemy. Giving up on alchemy forever, they return to their hometown to live normal lives. Two years later, Edward decides to research alchemy by heading out west. First anime series. Although Edward has the same background and characteristics in the manga and anime, Edward meets different people and fights against variable enemies. In the first anime, Edward learns the secret to destroying a homunculus during his encounter with Greed, whom he kills in an effort to save Alphonse. When he learns of Scar's creation of a Philosopher's Stone, Edward saves the people of Lior from being sacrificed for its creation. During his battle against the homunculi, Edward is killed by Envy, but Alphonse trades his soul for Edwards. In doing so, however, Alphonse's armor is used up and he disappears. After being revived, Edward sacrifices his own life to bring back his brother in exchange. As a result, Edward finds himself on the other side of the Gate, a parallel world, while Alphonse recovers his original body. Determined to return to Alphonse, Edward becomes involved in rocketry research in Germany, with the intention of using that technology to return to his home world. In the feature film, """", set two years after the end of the anime, Edward has been living in Germany and looks for a way to return to his world. At the film's end, he decides to stay in the parallel world along with Alphonse so that they may try to protect both worlds. In other media. Edward also appears in almost all the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" original video animations (OVAs). In the first OVA he appears as a super deformed version of himself at the movie's wrap-up party; in the second, he appears shortly as an old man living in modern-day Tokyo; and in the third OVA, he plays a part in the battle against the first anime's homunculi. As the series' titular character, Edward is playable in all ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" video games. The three games for the PlayStation 2 – ""Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel"", ' and ' – feature exclusive stories in which the Elrics keep searching for the Philosopher's Stone. In the Nintendo DS game, ""Fullmetal Alchemist Dual Sympathy"", he and Alphonse replay the first anime series. He is also featured in the ""Fullmetal Alchemist Trading Card Game"". There are two character CDs featuring tracks based on Edward's character. The first is named and the second ""Theme of Edward Elric"". Both albums were performed by Ed's Japanese voice actress, Romi Park. He also appears in each light novel written by Makoto Inoue which continue Ed and Al's search for the Philosopher's Stone and at the same time feature different stories from the ones appearing the manga and the anime. Creation and conception. Author Hiromu Arakawa integrated several social problems into the plot, such as the way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers after the death of their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help people all over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences in the same way as other alchemist appearing in the series. Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter. In a common slapstick gag from the series, Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell's wrench. While commenting that Edward has an ability easily dodge her, Arakawa comments that he gets hit on purpose as a result of his personality. The director of the first anime series, Seiji Mizushima, says that in the development of the story Edward ""evolves and devolves""; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine how to grow up. The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward lost something important. In a prototype from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype had an average height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine ""Monthly Shonen Gangan"", Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse' huge armor. In the design of the character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes. In the Japanese version of ""Fullmetal Alchemist""s anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna. Mignogna has stated that performing Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar and that he did not plan to sound like her. Reception. Edward's character is well received by manga readers; in each of the popularity polls made by ""Monthly Shōnen Gangan"" he has ranked first. Edward also won the Twenty-sixth Annual ""Animage"" Readers' Poll, Anime Grand Prix, in the ""Favorite Male Character""; Romi Park, who voices Edward in Japanese, won in the ""Favorite Seiyu"" category. Edward maintained a high place in the next year's poll in the same category. In the July 2009 issue of ""Newtype"", Edward ranked at the top of the survey Male Character Rankings. In the August 2009 issue his rank changed to fourth. In a ""Newtype"" poll from March 2010, Edward was voted as the fourth most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Edward won in the category ""Best Lead Character – Male"". He was also seventh in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie saying, "" and his kid brother Al make one of the best action-comedy teams in recent memory"". Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Edward's likeness, including plush toys, action figures, and key-chains. Vic Mignogna, who performs the voice of Edward in the English dub, was the winner in American Anime Awards in the category ""Best Actor"" for voicing Edward. Several publications for manga, anime, and other pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward's character. IGN writer Hilary Goldstein praises Edward as the perfect balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona, explaining that this allows the character to ""float between comical moments and underlying drama without seeming false."" Additionally, Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward's facial expressions as some of the most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical ""shōnen"" character as it is noted that he has ""very real skills, relationships, and personality"". Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting, and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series. Similarly, Mania Entertainment's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following ""dark paths"" in the same way as villains with the series, he is always supported by Alphonse who makes sure he is okay. Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward's journey, considering it very complex morally because he is trying to do good within a morally questionable organization. Lydia Hojnacki listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", noting the progression of the character's personality throughout the series, from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity. The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find a clue about how to recover his brother's body. On the other hand, Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward's development in the first animated adaptation of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" as in the series' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human.

wikipedia-2336919," The Just Assassins  The Just Assassins (original French title: Les Justes, more literal translations would be The Just or The Righteous) is a 1949 play by French writer and philosopher Albert Camus. The play is based on the true story of a group of Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries who assassinated the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich in 1905, and explores the moral issues associated with murder and terrorism. In the play, all but one (Stepan) of the ""Justes"" are based upon historical terrorists, described in ""Memoirs of a Terrorist"" by Boris Savinkov. Plot with analysis. Act I ""In the apartment used by the terrorists"" The 'justes' are a group of revolutionaries plotting to assassinate the Grand Duke with a bomb. The first attempt is meticulously set up, with Kaliayev selected to throw the bomb. Act II ""as before"" After a period of uncertainty as to the outcome of the first attempt, Kaliayev returns, saying he could not throw the bomb at the carriage, as it contained the Grand Duke's nephew and niece. Stepan is disgusted by this, pointing out that thousands of Russian children have died as a result of Tsarist oppression, but the others take Kaliayev's side, as killing children would harm their cause. Act III ""as before"" Kaliayev prepares for the second attempt and tries again, two days after the first try. He successfully kills the duke. Voinov leaves the group to join the Party's propaganda division. Act IV ""in a prison"" Kaliayev is in prison. He has a brief discussion with Foka before Skouratov enters. Skouratov discusses Kaliayev's actions with him before the Grand Duchess enters. She shows Kaliayev the human side of his crime (the actual death of the Grand Duke) and asks him to agree to being a murderer, not a revolutionary, in exchange for his life. Kaliayev is moved by her talk of her husband but stays firm. He says, ""Let me prepare myself to die. If I did not die-- it's then I'd be a murderer."" Skouratov reenters and makes Kaliayev an offer: either Kaliayev confesses and reveals the whereabouts of his fellows, or Skouratov will publish an article saying he repented his acts to the Grand Duchess, thereby making his fellows believe he betrayed them and their cause. Act V ""At the apartment"" It is the night of Kaliayev's execution. Annenkov, Dora and Stepan await news of him. Voinov returns for the same reason. Some suggest that Kaliayev may have betrayed them to save his own life, but Dora knows this is not true. This is confirmed shortly afterwards by news of Kaliayev's death. Dora, normally the most gentle of the group, takes on a Stepan-like attitude. She vows to throw herself into terrorism and either to destroy tyranny single-handed to avenge Kaliayev, or be caught, executed and thereby united with him. Characters. Ivan Kaliayev ('Yanek') - The lead character of the play. It is he who throws the bomb that kills the Grand Duke, and goes to prison for it. Kaliayev is also known among the terrorists as 'the poet'. He, like the other 'justes', has sacrificed a good life to fight the tyranny of the Tsarist regime. Despite the sadness and danger of terrorism, Kaliayev repeatedly affirms his love for life — indeed, he is fighting so as to bring a better life to others. He and Stepan Fedorov frequently come into conflict. He used to be the lover of Dora Doulebov. Kaliayev is seen making a number of religious gestures, such as crossing himself. He is also extremely moral, and uncomfortable with the idea of killing a man. His only consolation is that, in killing the Grand Duke, he will reduce suffering for thousands of others ('La Russie sera belle') and that he will pay for the human side of his crime with his life. Even then, he makes certain that he kills only the Grand Duke. Ivan Kaliayev was the real name of the terrorist, as Camus notes in his introduction. Stepan Fedorov - The only fictional revolutionary of the play, introduced by Camus to show his problems with the Communist party. Stepan enters the play having spent three years in prison before escaping to Switzerland (a reference to Lenin). As a consequence, he is very bitter and unable to appreciate the good aspects of life. He feels that 'freedom is a prison while even one man on Earth is enslaved', and frequently talks about insane acts of indiscriminate destruction, such as asking Dora 'how many bombs would it take to blow up Moscow?'. He also persistently asks to be allowed to throw the bomb, but the other members of the group see him as too unstable to be allowed to do so. Dora Doulebov - Former lover of Kaliayev. She has had training in chemistry, and therefore acts as the group's bomb-maker. Dora, more than any other of the revolutionaries, remembers and talks fondly of her life before joining the Party. Though normally very gentle, Dora adopts a Stepan-like persona at the end of the play, wishing to avenge Kaliayev's death or die trying. Boris Annenkov - The leader of the Party. Annenkov makes all the decisions about the assassination, such as who will throw the bomb. He acts in a mediating role in conflicts between Kaliayev and Stepan, and generally serves to calm the feelings of the other members of the group. Alexis Voinov - A former university student, Voinov was thrown out of university for anti-Tsarist comments. Voinov places a very high value on truth, and feels he must fight tyranny actively. However, when he finds himself unable to throw his bomb in the first assassination attempt, he realises that he is not suited for direct violent action — he is afraid of the moment of deciding to throw the bomb, and he is ashamed of this. He decides instead to transfer to the propaganda division of the Party, saying that although the risks are the same, he does not have to see them. The five characters above make up the 'justes' of the title. Other characters: The Grand Duchess - Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, Widow of Grand Duke Serge. She appears in only one scene, confronting Kaliayev in prison about his actions. She emphasises the human side of the Grand Duke's death, talking about his little habits and good qualities. She asks Kaliayev to admit to being a murderer rather than a revolutionary, in exchange for a pardon, and to accept Christianity. Kaliayev finds his justification severely weakened, but manages to reject her offer. Skouratov - A member of the secret police who visits Kaliayev in prison. Skouratov represents the hopelessness of struggling against a despotic society. He asks Kaliayev to betray his comrades in exchange for freedom for all of them, but Kaliayev refuses to do so. Skouratov then has published, or threatens to have publish, a newspaper article saying Kaliayev did betray them, so as to destroy the unity of the group. However, if he does so, the group do not believe him. Foka - A man Kaliayev meets in prison who has murdered someone while drunk. Foka is sceptical towards Kaliayev's socialism, and is instead very acceptant of the world (when Kaliayev describes the socialist vision to him, Foka simply says it is heaven). He is serving a 20-year sentence, but acts as a hangman, getting a year off his sentence for each criminal he hangs. Prison guard - Not even a character. All he does is tell Kaliayev and Foka to be quiet until Skouratov arrives. "

wikipedia-2271479," Nihang  Nihang () are an armed Sikh order. Also known as Akali (lit. ""the eternal""), they were part of the Akal Sena started by Guru Hargobind, the Khalsa being an expansion of the Akal Sena. Early Sikh military history is dominated by Nihang, known especially for their victories in cases where they were heavily outnumbered. Traditionally known for their bravery and ruthlessness in the battlefield, the Nihang once formed the guerilla squads of the armed forces of Ranjit Sukkarchak. Etymology. The word ""Nihang"" comes from the Persian word for a mythical sea creature (). The term owes its origin to Mughal historians, who compared the ferocity of the Sikh warrior-mendicants with that of crocodiles. Arms and attire. The Nihang wear full attire of superelectric blue, edged bracelets of iron round their wrists (""jangi kara"") and quoits of steel (""chakram"") tiered in their lofty conical blue turbans, together with the traditional knife carried by all baptised Sikhs (""kirpan""). When fully armed a Nihang will also bear one or two swords (either the curved talwar or the straight khanda) on his right hip, a dagger (""katara"") on his left hip, a buckler made from buffalo-hide (""dhala"") on his back, a large chakram around his neck, and an iron chain. In times of war, arms worn on the Nihang's person would generally be reserved until the warrior lost the weapon he held, often a bow or spear (""barcha"").  The Nihang were particularly famous for their high turbans and their extensive use of the chakram or war-quoit. Their turbans were often pointed at the top and outfitted with a trishula or trident which could be used for stabbing in close-quarters. Other times, the turbans would be armed with one or several chakram to slice at an opponent's eyes. These steel-reinforced turbans, it was said, afforded enough protection so that there was no need for any other form of headgear. Armour consisted of ""sanjo"" or iron chainmail worn under an iron breastplate (""char aina""). Nihang war-shoes (""jangi mojeh"") were constructed of iron at the toe, making their pointed toes capable of inflicting cuts and stab wounds. Nihang today. Today, Nihang are accorded great respect and affection among the Sikh community worldwide. While the order is primarily ceremonial, they are duty-bound to defend their people and faith in times of war. On the festival of Hola Mohalla, Nihang gather in their thousands at Anandpur where they display their martial skills. Their fighting style, although formally called ""shastar vidiya"", is more commonly known as gatka. In 2011, Nidar Singh claimed to be the only living master of pre-gatka shaster vidiya. Use of hemp. Some Nihang groups consume cannabis or bhang () to help in meditation. In 2001, Baba Santa Singh, the Jathedar of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of ""bhang"" by the apex Sikh clergy. Baba Santa Singh was excommunicated for helping the Indian congress government rebuild the Akal Takht in 1984 he was replaced with Baba Balbir Singh, who shunned the consumption of ""bhang"". "

wikipedia-2271552," Polidocanol  Polidocanol is a local anaesthetic and antipruritic component of ointments and bath additives. It relieves itching caused for example by dry skin conditions such as eczema. The substance is also used as a sclerosant, an irritant injected to treat varicose veins, under the trade names Asclera and Aethoxysklerol. Polidocanol causes fibrosis inside varicose veins, occluding the lumen of the vessel, and reducing the appearance of the varicosity. The FDA has approved polidocanol injections for the treatment of small varicose (less than 1 mm in diameter) and reticular veins (1 to 3 mm in diameter). Polidocanol works by damaging the cell lining of blood vessels, causing them to close and eventually be replaced by other types of tissue. "
wikipedia-2271571," Felix Zollicoffer  Felix Kirk Zollicoffer (May 19, 1812 – January 19, 1862) was a newspaperman, three-term United States Congressman from Tennessee, officer in the United States Army, and a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War. He led the first Confederate invasion of eastern Kentucky and was killed in action at the Battle of Mill Springs. Zollicoffer was the first Confederate general to die in the Western Theater. Early life and career. Felix Zollicoffer was born on a plantation in Bigbyville in Maury County, Tennessee, a son of John Jacob and Martha (Kirk) Zollicoffer. He was a descended from emigrants from Switzerland who had settled in North Carolina in 1710. His grandfather, George Zollicoffer, had served as a captain in the Revolutionary War, and had been granted a tract of land in Tennessee as payment for his military service. Zollicoffer attended the local schools and studied for a year at Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee. He left at age sixteen and became an apprentice printer, engaged in newspaper work in Paris, Tennessee, from 1828 to 1830. When the newspaper closed, he moved to Knoxville in 1831 and worked for two years as a journeyman printer at the ""Knoxville Register"". Three years later, he became editor and part owner of the ""Columbia Observer"". Zollicoffer was elected State Printer of Tennessee in 1835. On September 24, 1835, he married Louisa Pocahontas Gordon, with whom he had fourteen children. However, only six of them survived infancy. Louisa Zollicoffer died in 1857. Zollicoffer also edited the ""Mercury"" for a time in Huntsville, Alabama. He volunteered for the army in 1836 and served as a second lieutenant in the Tennessee militia in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He then returned to Tennessee and became owner and editor of the ""Columbia Observer"" and the ""Southern Agriculturist"" and in 1843 the editor of the ""Republican Banner"", the state organ of the Whig Party. This brought Zollicoffer into political circles, and he was Comptroller of the State Treasury from 1845–1849, as well as Adjutant General for the state. He was a member of the State Senate from 1849 until 1852, and was a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1852, supporting General Winfield Scott. Zollicoffer was himself elected as a Whig to the Thirty-third United States Congress and was reelected as a candidate of the American Party to the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1853 – March 3, 1859). During his first campaign, he fought a duel with the editor of the rival ""Nashville Union"" newspaper. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1858 and retired to private life. He supported fellow Tennessee moderate John Bell (CU) for president in the election of 1860. Following the secession of the Deep South in 1861, Zollicoffer served on the peace convention in Washington, D.C. in an attempt to prevent the approaching civil war. A strong supporter of states rights, Zollicoffer nevertheless opposed Tennessee's secession from the Union. Civil War. Tennessee voters rejected the call for a secession convention in February 1861. . Tennessee Governor Isham Harris soon began to maneuver the state into a position where secession would be inevitable. On May 6, 1861, the Tennessee legislature, urged on by Harris, adopted a ""Declaration of Independence and Ordinance."" The people were to vote on the ratification of this measure on June 8. A separate vote on the same date would determine if Tennessee should join the Confederacy if the voters approved the measure asserting independence of the State. On May 9, a joint committee of the legislature issued an explanation sponsored by Harris of the military alliance Tennessee had entered into with the Confederacy on May 7. During the period between April and July, Harris organized a state army, the Provisional Army of Tennessee. Upon the announcement of the formation of the Provisional Army of Tennessee, Zollicoffer offered his service to the state army. Despite only having brief combat experience, he was appointed as a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of Tennessee on May 9, 1861, by Governor Isham Harris. On July 9, 1861, Zollicoffer was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. Although the Confederate States Army began to absorb the Provisional Army of Tennessee on July 31, 1861, Zollicoffer's troops were not mustered into Confederate service until the end of October. For almost four months, Zollicoffer was in the strange position of being a Confederate Army general in charge of state troops. Harris initially tried to sway eastern Tennessee's pro-Union population with a lenient policy and the stationing of only fifteen companies of troops in the region. On July 26, 1861, Harris, who was still in charge of the Tennessee state force, ordered Zollicoffer and 4,000 raw recruits to Knoxville to be in position to suppress resistance to secession in East Tennessee, appointing him to command the District of East Tennessee. Harris was re-elected governor on August 8, 1861 and on August 18, he ordered Zollicoffer to arrest and, if necessary, banish leaders of pro-Union factions from the State, changing his policy from leniency to force. In an effort to prevent a Union Army incursion into East Tennessee, Zollicoffer took the initiative and occupied Cumberland Gap on September 14, 1861. Zollicoffer then was responsible for guarding the 128 miles of Confedrate line between Cumberland Gap and Tompkinsville, Kentucky. For 71 miles, this line crossed the Cumberland Mountains. On September 15, 1861, General Albert Sidney Johnston assumed command of Confederate forces in the Western Theater between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. He retained Zollicoffer as district commander in east Tennessee. On September 17, 1861, Zollicoffer sent a force through the Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road to drive the Union Army from Barbourville, Kentucky, relieve pressure on the recently established Confederate line at Bowling Green, Kentucky and thwart an expected drive by Union Brigadier General George H. Thomas into eastern Tennessee and the Cumberland Gap by forcing him to retain his force in Kentucky. On September 19, 800 of Zollicoffer's men under Colonel Joel Battle ambushed the Union force of about 150 home guards while they were foraging and pushed them out of Barbourville at the minor Battle of Barbourville. Another detachment of Zollicoffer's force under Colonel James Rains dispersed an encampment of Union recruits at Laurel Bridge, Kentucky on September 26, 1861 while the Goose Creek Salt Works were attacked by a second Confederate unit under Colonel D. H. Cummings who carried off 200 barrels of salt. Zollicoffer's force was essentially on a raid and soon withdrew. In mid-October 1861, a large part of Zollicoffer's force marched from Cumberland Gap to London, Kentucky. At the Battle of Wildcat Mountain on October 21, Zollicoffer's force was stymied by a prepared Union force fighting on rugged terrain and he soon retreated into rural eastern Tennessee, which remained rife with Union sentiment. In November 1861, Zollicoffer changed strategy and advanced westward, then back into southeastern Kentucky to strengthen Confederate control in the area just south of Somerset. He hoped this would put him in a position to be reinforced by Confederate forces from Bowling Green and to drive Thomas's force from the area. Before he moved west, Zollicoffer left forces to guard the Cumberland Gap and three other approaches to east Tennessee. Zollicoffer moved west and established an encampment at Mill Springs, Kentucky (near present day Nancy, Kentucky) on the south bank of the Cumberland River. By December 6, he moved his force to the north bank of the river where he thought he could better support the supply of his men, build fortifications and keep watch on Thomas's force. This was a risky tactic because Zollicoffer's men were poorly equipped, ill-trained and ill-disciplined. They were not properly prepared to meet the growing Union threat and Zollicoffer's expectation that he would solve this problem by receiving supplies and reinforcements at Beech Grove, opposite Mill Springs, was too optimistic. Many of the men in Confederate service in Tennessee who could have reinforced Zollicoffer's force remained unarmed. Zollicoffer's own reserve force at Knoxville was mostly unarmed. Under the circumstances in December 1861, without needed supplies or reserves, Zollicoffer was in no position to move against the Union force. On December 20, 1861, Zollicoffer did not respond to a movement by a force under Brigadier General Albin F. Schoepf who was attempting to provoke Zollicoffer to commit his force to an engagement in the open. Colonel William H. Carroll did not leave Knoxville with his brigade to join Zollicoffer until January 16, 1862. Ultimately, he could bring only a single regiment to Mill Springs, having been ordered to send the rest of his men to Bowling Green. Unaware of the situation in east Tennessee and of Zollicoffer's plan, on December 8, 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Major General George B. Crittenden to command the district of East Tennessee in order to lead a force into Kentucky. Crittenden assumed command of the district only to find that the ten regiments of soldiers he expected to find there did not exist. Crittenden retained Zollicoffer as commander of the 1st Brigade in his army. On December 15, Zollicoffer sent word to Crittenden that Thomas had ten regiments under his command. While lingering at Knoxville for two more weeks, Crittenden sent word to Zollicoffer to move back to the south side of the Cumberland River. Zollicoffer now had only two rafts to cross the swollen river which was nearly at flood stage. So he stayed at Beech Grove on the north side of the river. On January 1, 1862, Thomas moved from his camp at Lebanon, Kentucky to join with Schoepf's troops from Somerset. On January 2, Crittenden arrived at Mill Springs and decided the Confederates should attack Thomas before he could join with Schoepf. The Confederate force of about 6,500 men might have withstood an attack within their fortifications but Thomas's larger force would have the advantage in an open field. Because of the incessant rain and resulting mud, Thomas needed 18 days to move his force and equipment from Lebanon to Logan's Crossroads. On January 18, 1862, Crittenden ordered an advance at midnight while the two Union forces under Thomas and Schoepf were separated by the rain-swollen Fishing Creek. Zollicoffer commanded the first brigade toward Logan's Crossroads while Carroll commanded the following brigade. After marching in a driving rain, Zollicoffer's skirmishers attacked the Union pickets south of the intersection of the Mill Springs and Columbia-Somerset roads. The Battle of Mill Springs, sometimes called the Battle of Fishing Creek or the Battle of Logan's Crossroads, a three-hour fight in driving rain, fog and the smoke of battle over thickly wooded ground, followed. The untrained Confederates were totally confused in this situation and their organization was lost. Adding to the confusion, some of the Confederates were wearing blue uniforms. The 15th Mississippi Infantry Regiment mistook the Union 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for blue-clad Confederates. In the confusion, the near-sighted Zollicoffer, wearing a white raincoat, rode into the lines of the 4th Kentucky and began to discuss the problem with the Union colonel, Speed S. Fry. A Confederate aide then rode out of the fog firing at the Union force. Union soldiers returned fire, killing Zollicoffer who had begun to ride away as the incident unfolded. Historian Larry J. Daniel follows some other accounts which claim that Fry recognized and shot Zollicoffer. He further stated that Fry, not Zollicoffer, had ridden into the enemy lines and had begun the conversation, only turning upon Zollicoffer when the Confederate aide rode up. Historian Stuart W. Sanders discusses the encounter at the greatest length and also quotes a subsequent account by Colonel Fry. He states that both officers rode out from their lines and that Fry initially thought Zollicoffer was a Union officer. Fry claimed to have shot Zollicoffer. Other accounts state that Fry also called to a few of his men to fire, although Fry later denied this. Many of the old Confederate flintlock weapons would not fire in the wet conditions and Zollicoffer's death caused his demoralized men to start a retreat. Thomas sent six regiments against the weak Confederate flank causing the Confederate line to collapse and retreat to Beech Grove. Crittenden removed the remaining force across the Cumberland River overnight on a small steamboat and a few barges. He left his artillery, mules, equipment and most of his food supply on the north bank. The Union had gained a significant victory and boost in morale while the Confederates had lost a brave, if unskilled, general along with about 500 men and the small army's equipment and supplies. Interment. The Federals treated Zollicoffer's body with respect. He was embalmed by a Union surgeon and was eventually returned to Tennessee and interred in the Old City Cemetery in Nashville. Zollicoffer Park. Zollicoffer Park, a Confederate cemetery containing a mass grave of the Confederate fallen, lies just outside of Nancy. (There is also a Union cemetery located in Nancy, Mill Springs National Cemetery, the oldest of all National Cemeteries still receiving burials other than Arlington National Cemetery). This public park receives at least two memorial events each year, one on January 19, (""that somber sabbath morn"") and the other on Memorial Day. There have also been re-enactments of the Battle of Mill Springs. "
wikipedia-2271575," Lose Yourself  ""Lose Yourself"" is a song by the American hip-hop artist Eminem, released as the first single from the original soundtrack to his movie ""8 Mile"" on November 13, 2002. It was written and produced by Eminem himself, along with longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, one half of the production duo Bass Brothers. The song was largely written during the filming of ""8 Mile"", including several elements written entirely on set by Eminem. The song largely plays to the themes of the film, as it is largely based around, and written from the viewpoint of, the character of Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, Jr., the role taken on by Eminem in the film, and the events of the film itself. ""Lose Yourself"" is a mid-tempo hardcore hip-hop track with an urgent narrative delivery. The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by ""B-Rabbit"" during the film, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers, as this is his ambition, but he has constantly been held back by his own personal problems. The song's production incorporates elements of several instruments, including piano, violins and several other string instruments. The song is one of three new Eminem solo songs featured on the soundtrack, the other two being titled ""8 Mile"" and ""Rabbit Run"". Several critics cited this trio of songs as the best three from the soundtrack, as well as the most aggressive songs ever recorded by Eminem. ""Lose Yourself"" itself was also received very positively, with many critics praising the song's aggressive themes and describing it as Eminem's best work to date. Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics and the production were also praised as well. In many retrospective reviews and lists, critics have cited the song among Eminem's finest, as well as one of the best hip-hop songs of all time. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Eminem himself, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. The video is a mixture of several scenarios, largely including several scenes from 8 Mile: however, it also contains scenes addressing problems the real life Eminem has addressed, as well as ""B-Rabbit""'s difficulties, including the ostracism by rap communities towards him due to his colour, and his difficult personal life. The song earned Eminem five Grammy nominations at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, making it the first ever rap song to have received this accolade. In 2004, it was one of only three hip-hop songs from the twenty-first century to have been included on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and was also the highest ranking, at number 166. Rolling Stone also ranked it one of the top 50 hip hop songs of all time. As of June 29, 2012, it has had over 5,000,000 downloads in the United States alone, and has been certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 5,000,000 copies in the United States. It was ranked number 93 on AFI's 100 years...100 songs. In October 2011, ""NME"" placed it at number 57 on its list ""150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years"". VH1 placed it at #4 for the best songs of the 2000s. The song has been routinely used to close out shows ever since it has been released, as it is considered to be a strong crowd favorite due to it being his most recognizable song.  Background. Eminem says that ""Lose Yourself"" was written on set, during breaks during the filming of ""8 Mile"". Taryn Manning, who played Eminem's ex-girlfriend Janeane in the movie ""8 Mile"", said in an interview with MTV, that during the filming of the movie, in any downtime, Eminem was writing and that ""you could just see him formulating stuff in his head."" According to studio engineer Steven King, who spoke to Rolling Stone magazine, Eminem recorded the song in a portable studio on the set while he was on a break from shooting, recording all three verses in one take. The sheet on which he wrote the song appears in ""8 Mile"" in a scene where his character is writing while riding the bus. A Drum & Bass remix has been made and was released on the mixtape ""Straight from the Lab"", as a European bonus track. Composition. The song's lyrics explicitly sum up the background info about Eminem's character in ""8 Mile"", B. Rabbit, with the first verse summing up much of the plot of the movie. Piano chords described as ""instantly recognizable"" open the song. Throughout the song there is a ""tense, unrelenting guitar lick"". Success and legacy. ""Lose Yourself"" is the most successful single of Eminem's mainstream career. Upon its release, the track was a worldwide chart success, peaking at number one on 24 national charts worldwide, these included the US ""Billboard"" Hot 100, making it Eminem's first number-one hit in the United States. It had a 12-week run at #1 in the United States & Australia, and topped the charts in many other countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and Denmark. It debuted at number nine in Canada and moved up to #1 the following week. According to the ""Guinness Book of World Records"", ""Lose Yourself"" became the ""Longest Running Single at Number One for a Rap Song"" at 23 weeks. In the United States, ""Lose Yourself"" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart the week of October 5, 2002, at #43. A week later, the single jumped to #18, and hit #1 by 9 November. The single spent 16 total weeks in the Top 10, and a total of 23 weeks in the Top 50. While in the #1 spot (from 11/09/02 through 1/25/03), ""Lose Yourself""'s impressive run kept several top contenders for the #1 spot from ever reaching #1, including Jay-Z, Nelly, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, and especially Missy Elliott, whose single ""Work It"" was at #2 for 10 weeks. As of July 2013, it has sold 5,555,000 copies in the US. The song also topped the Pop Songs chart for 7 weeks and hit #4 and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rap Songs charts. The song also used some rock music origins allowing moderate success to alternative rock radio peaking #14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the rapper's only song to chart. The song went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Original Song (the first time a rap song ever won this award), beating other nominees like U2's ""The Hands That Built America."" Eminem, who was not present at the award ceremony believing he would not win, said in a Shade 45 Behind The Boards interview with Cipha Sounds that he was actually sleeping, with cartoons on for his daughter, at the time the award was announced. This was the first time in 14 years the winner of the Best Original Song category did not perform at the ceremony. Luis Resto, one of the song's co-writers, had attended the ceremony and accepted the award instead. ""He's creative, he has symphonies in his head,"" Resto said at the lectern about Eminem. The American Film Institute later ranked it #93 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs from American Films. At the Grammy Awards of 2004, ""Lose Yourself"" became Eminem's second career nomination for Record of the Year (following ""Without Me""), and the first rap song ever to be nominated for Song of the Year. It won Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song, which was a brand new category at the time. At #166, ""Lose Yourself"" is the highest ranked of the three songs from the 21st century featured in the 2004 List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (joining ""Stan"" at #290 and Outkast's ""Hey Ya!"" at #180). The magazine later ranked the song the twelfth best of the '00s decade. The song was the 51st best-selling single of the '00s decade in the United Kingdom In October 2011, ""NME"" placed it at number 57 on its list ""150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years"". VH1 placed it at #4 for the best songs of the 2000s. Several critics cited this trio of songs as the best three from the soundtrack, as well as the most aggressive songs ever recorded by Eminem. ""Lose Yourself"" itself was also received very positively, with many critics praising the song's aggressive themes and describing it as Eminem's best work to date. Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics and the production were also praised as well. In many retrospective reviews and lists, critics have cited the song among Eminem's finest, as well as one of the best hip-hop songs of all time. Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the production of song: ""The opening track and first single ""Lose Yourself"" is easily equaled by the title song with its layered pianos"" and he highlighted it. NME Magazine was extremely positive: ""Eminem's urgent radio hit 'Lose Yourself', you already know. It's excellent, if obviously an offcut from 'The Eminem Show', all thundering rawk guitars and Rocky-ish bassline (appropriately enough)."" RapReviews also noted: ""And as all great journeys begin with a single step, so too does Eminem with this album's opening song AND lead single entitled ""Lose Yourself"":  ""And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter Caught up between bein a father and a primadonna Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got."" Critic concluded: ""Eminem doesn't always produce stellar tracks for himself (always competent if occasionally bland) but on ""Lose Yourself"" he strikes a perfect balance with the assistance of Jeff Bass. Guitar riffs gradually build up the intensity during each verse, which thunders to a symphonic height in each chorus as it crashes into hard licks and tinkling pianoes. Eminem screams dire warnings in these breaks to all up-and-coming rap artists out there: ""You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow; this opportunity comes once in a lifetime."" Indeed, that's what Marshall's life story and the movie based on it are supposed to be about - making sure to take that shot."" 411 Mania praised the song: ""The album wastes no time, delivering the hit Lose Yourself as the first track. The song is basically as close to a ballad as Eminem will ever get. It is a very hot, adrenaline-laced track. It also continues Eminem’s recent trend of putting out tracks with more of a meaning."" Music video. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Eminem himself, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. The video is a mixture of several scenarios, largely including several scenes from ""8 Mile"", however it also contains scenes addressing problems the real life Eminem has addressed, as well as ""B-Rabbit""'s difficulties, including the ostracism by rap communities towards him due to his color, and his difficult personal life. The music video for ""Lose Yourself"" was filmed in Detroit, Michigan, and thus contains numerous shots of the city, including the Ambassador Bridge. The video is a mixture of multiple scenarios, including scenes from and reminiscent of the movie ""8 Mile"", and Eminem rapping next to the ""8 Mile Rd. Mobile Court"" sign that appears on the cover of the movie's soundtrack. It contains scenes focusing on Rabbit's and the real life Eminem's character, for example, the difficulties he has to face while rapping, the insult and booing of crowds as he is a white rapper and the trouble he has to face due to his alcoholic mother and people he hangs out with. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards it received the award for Best Video from a Film in the final year this award was given out. It also received nominations for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best Rap Video, and Viewer's Choice. He won a MuchMusic Video Award in 2003 for Favorite International Artist with the video for ""Lose Yourself"". The official video (uploaded by Eminem) has been viewed over 65 million times on YouTube making it one of Eminem's most popular videos on that site. However, it was restricted from viewing in 2011, spawning various privately uploaded versions. Credits and personnel. The credits for ""Lose Yourself"" are adapted from the liner notes of the original soundtrack to the movie ""8 Mile"". "

He was a Captain in the 27 Sindh Regiment of the Pakistan. Name. Captain Sher Khan was born in Nawan Killi (Shewa Adda), a village in Swabi District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. ""Karnal"" is a localised form of ""Colonel"". Karnel Sher Khan's home village of Nawan Kali (""New Village"") has now been named after him as Karnal Sher Killi (""Village of Karnal Sher Khan""). Early life. Captain Sher Khan was the youngest of his two brothers and two sisters. His mother died in 1978 when he was eight. He was brought up by his paternal aunts. His family is deeply religious and they say that Sher was an embodiment of piety and Islamic teaching. Education and career. After completing his intermediate schooling at the Government College Swabi, he joined the Pakistan Air Force as an airman. On completion of his training, he was appointed electric fitter (aeronautical) at Risalpur. During these years he applied twice for commission in the Pakistan Army as a Commissioned Officer. He succeeded the second time. He joined the Pakistan Military Academy, Kakul, in November 1992 and graduated in the 90th Long Course in 1994. His first posting was at Okara in 27th Sindh Regiment. Always smiling as a devoted soldier, he was fondly called Shera (Lion) and was very popular among his officers and colleagues. In January 1998 he volunteered to serve at the LoC in Kashmir, he was posted in 12 NLI. Kargil conflict. Captain Sher Khan was posthumously awarded Pakistan's highest gallantry award, the Nishan-e-Haider, for his actions during the Kargil Conflict with India in 1999. The following is the official statement by the Pakistan Army: He counterattacked the enemy at Tiger Hill during day when enemy could easily see his movements. It was a surprise for Indian Army as they were not expecting any thing like that. It was considered as a suicide counterattack but being familiar with the positions of that post Karnal Sher was not only successful in forcing the enemy to retreat but also followed them to their base camp and embraced shahadat. He was recommended by Indian Army for Pakistan highest gallantry in recognition of his unusual bravery that he showed on battlefield. "
wikipedia-2271583," Fokker G.I  The Fokker G.I was a Dutch heavy twin-engined fighter plane comparable in size and role to the German Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the British Mosquito. Although in production prior to World War II, its combat introduction came at a time when the Netherlands was overrun. The few G.1s that were mustered into service were able to score some victories, but ultimately the aircraft was withdrawn from operations, and the remainder of the production run was taken over by the ""Luftwaffe"" as trainers. Design and development. The G.I, given the nickname ""le Faucheur"" (""reaper"" in French), was designed as a private venture in 1936 by Fokker chief engineer Dr. Schatzki. Intended for the role of ""jachtkruiser"", ""heavy"" fighter or air cruiser, able to gain air superiority over the battlefield as well as being a bomber destroyer, the G.1 would fulfill a role seen as important at the time, by advocates of Giulio Douhet's theories on air power. The Fokker G.I utilized a twin-engined, twin-boom layout that featured a central nacelle housing two or three crew members (a pilot, radio operator/navigator/rear gunner or a bombardier) as well as a formidable armament of twin 23 mm (.91 in) Madsen cannon and a pair of 7.9 mm (.31 in) machine guns (later eight machine guns) in the nose and one in a rear turret. Besides its main mission, the G.1 could be configured for ground attack and light bombing missions (it could carry a bomb load of one 400 kg/882 lb bomb or combinations of two 200 kg/441 lb or 10 26 kg/57 lb bombs). The design and construction of the prototype (registered as X-2) was completed in just seven months. At its introduction at the Paris Air Show in November 1936, even before its first flight, the G.I was a sensation, appearing in a purple and yellow finish (evocative of the Spanish Republican colors, thought to be Fokker's first export customer). Like all Fokker aircraft of the period, the G.I was of mixed construction; the front of the central pod and the tail booms were built around a welded frame, covered with aluminium plating. The back of the central pod, however, as well as the wings, had a wooden frame, covered with triplex, a technique also used in Fokker's successful passenger aircraft at that time. The G.I prototype, powered by 485 kW (650 hp) Hispano-Suiza 14AB-02/03 engines, had its first flight at Welschap Airfield, near Eindhoven on 16 March 1937 with Karel Toman-Mares at the controls. Later, Emil Meinecke took over much of the test flights. The maiden flight went well, but a subsequent test flight in September 1937 ended with a supercharger explosion that nearly caused the loss of the prototype. The accident prompted a replacement of the Hispano-Suiza engines with 559 kW (750 hp) Pratt & Whitney SB4-G Twin Wasp Junior engines. Operational history. During testing, the company received a contract from the Spanish Republican government for 26 G.1 ""export"" versions with Pratt & Whitney engines. Despite receiving payment, the order was destined never to be fulfilled as the Dutch government placed an embargo on the sale of military equipment to Spain. Fokker however continued building the aircraft and a story was released to the press that they were intended for Finland, hence the persistent tales about a ""Finnish"" order. Besides the Dutch ""Luchtvaartafdeeling"", several foreign air forces showed an interest in the G.I. as either a fighter or dive-bomber. In order to test its potential as a dive-bomber, the G.1 prototype was fitted with hydraulically operated dive brakes under the wings. Flight tests revealed that the G.1 was capable of diving at over 644 km/h (400 mph) and demonstrated aerobatic capabilities. Swedish Air Force officer Captain Björn Bjuggren tested the G.1 in over 20 dives and reported favourably on its effectiveness as a dive bomber. Orders for G.1b Wasp aircraft came from Spain (26 ordered) and Sweden (18), while the Mercury variant was ordered by Denmark (12) and Sweden (72). Although Belgium, Turkey, Hungary and Switzerland air forces showed great interest, they never placed firm orders.  The ""Luchtvaartafdeeling"" ordered 36 G.Ias with 541 kW (725 hp) Bristol Mercury VIII engines, the standard engine used by the Dutch Air Force in the Fokker D.XXI fighter, in order to equip two squadrons. Only the first four examples were built as three-seaters intended for ground-attack, with the remainder being completed as two-seat fighters. During the lead-up to hostilities, a total of 26 G.Ias were operational in the 3rd ""Jachtvliegtuigafdeling"" (JaVA) at Rotterdam (Waalhaven Airfield), and 4th JaVA Fighter Group at Bergen near Alkmaar. The aircraft were actively involved in border patrols and in order to ensure neutrality, on 20 March 1940, a G.1a from 4th JaVA forced down an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley from the RAF's 77 sqn when it strayed into Dutch air space. Battle of the Netherlands. On 10 May 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, 23 G.1a aircraft were serviceable while production of Spain's order of the G.1b variant continued with a dozen aircraft completed, awaiting armament. The German invasion started with an early morning (03:50 hours) ""Luftwaffe"" attack on the Dutch airfields. While the 4th JaVA received a devastating blow, losing all but one of its aircraft, at least two 3rd JaVA G.1a fighters were launched in time to down three of the Heinkel He 111 bombers. The two squadrons continued to fly, but with mounting losses, bringing their numbers down to three airworthy aircraft by the end of the first day. At the Fokker factory, the embargoed Spanish G.1bs aircraft were confiscated. All of these aircraft were unarmed, but three examples were hastily fitted with a four nose-mounted machine gun armament array. In the ""Five-day War"", the available G.1 fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions, strafing advancing German infantry units, but also used to attack Junkers Ju 52/3m transports. Although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results, G.1 fighters were employed over Rotterdam and the Hague, contributing to the loss of 167 Ju 52s, scoring up to 14 confirmed kills. Aftermath. At the conclusion of hostilities, several G.Is were captured by the Germans, with the remainder of the Spanish order and G.1bs that the Danish government had ordered in 1939 completed at the Fokker plant by mid-1941 in order for the G.1s to be assigned as fighter trainers for Bf 110 crews at Wiener Neustadt. For the next two years, ""Flugzeugführerschule"" (B) 8 flew the G.1b until attrition grounded the fleet. On 5 May 1941, a Fokker test pilot, Hidde Leegstra, accompanied by engineer (and member of the Fokker Board of Directors) Ir. Piet Vos, managed to fly a G.1 to England. The crew's subterfuge involved acquiring additional fuel for the supposed test flight as well as ducking into clouds to deter the trailing ""Luftwaffe"" aircraft from following. After landing in England, the G.1 was conscripted by Phillips and Powis Aircraft, later Miles Aircraft. The company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber, and was interested in the G.1 wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a British climate. Despite being left outdoors for the remainder of the war, the G.1 survived only to be eventually scrapped after 1945. There are no surviving G.Is today, although a replica can be found at the Dutch Air Force Museum in Soesterberg. "
wikipedia-2271598," Just Lose It  ""Just Lose It"" is a comedy hip hop song by Eminem. It is the first single from his fifth studio album ""Encore"" and was later included on his 2005 compilation album, """". The song caused controversy as its lyrics and music video parodies Michael Jackson, who was being accused of child molestation at the time. The song also pokes fun at Beavis/Cornholio, MC Hammer, Madonna and others. It also heavily spoofs Pee-wee Herman, going as far as imitating his signature shout during the chorus and Eminem dressing like him in the video. The song reached number one in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and number six in the United States. Despite charting high, the song did not perform as well as his two previous lead singles, ""The Real Slim Shady"" and ""Without Me"". Background. Two skits regarding the Michael Jackson controversy were included on ""Encore"", ""Paul (Skit)"" and ""Em Calls Paul (Skit)"". The lyrics to ""Just Lose It"" refer to Jackson's legal troubles, however he does state in his song ""... and that's not a stab at Michael, That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho..."" At the beginning of the song there is a lyrical excerpt from Eminem's 2002 single ""Without Me"" about how ""Shady's back"". The line ""Snap back to reality. Look! It's B. Rabbit"" and ""You signed me up to battle"" refers to ""Lose Yourself"" and Eminem's character in the movie ""8 Mile"". In the second verse of the song there is a line ""So fellas, fellas..."" which is a reference to Sir Mix-a-Lot's song ""Baby Got Back"". The line ""Girl you know you're my world,"" from the chorus, is a reference to the chorus of his song ""Superman"" from his album ""The Eminem Show"". Critical response. Allmusic in review for album highlighted the song. Entertainment Weekly wrote a mixed opinion: ""First came the sarcastically bouncy ""Just Lose It,"" a lazy retread of earlier hits that, with its easy-target references to Michael Jackson, made Eminem appear to be the one who'd actually lost it."" J-23 panned the song: ""Then of course there is ""Just Lose It,"" by far the worst song Eminem or Dr. Dre has ever made. It really seems like their object here was to make the worst song possible. The interlude leading into it is damn hilarious though."" Pitchfork was positive: ""Just Lose It"" is still most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially multilayered as the best of The Marhsall Mathers LP, yet it's still more curio than anything else."" NME wrote a somehow good opinion: ""Em (is) reduced to making funny noises to keep things interesting."" RapReviews concluded that it isn't ""dropping any jaws or widening any eyes."" Rolling Stone described this song as ""dance-music dis."" USA Today concluded that this song that makes fun of Michael Jackson and his child-molestation scandal."" The Guardian described: ""Just Lose It, his plan appears to involve belching and making fart noises, which, with the best will in the world, won't suffice."" The New York Times noted: ""The first single, ""Just Lose It,"" is meant to be fizzy and freewheeling, but instead it unfolds as a series of puzzlingly unfunny jokes."" Stylus Magazine was negative: ""That Em’s brand new tendency to bite himself."" Music video. The video contains a parody of a rap battle scene from ""8 Mile"" in which it is Eminem, as B-Rabbit, versus Eminem, as Slim Shady. It also contains several scenes where Eminem is walking down the streets naked. As he is doing this, Dr. Dre is seen driving next to him, looking disgusted. For the music video, the lyrics were edited slightly, notably the phrase ""shake that ass"", becoming the less provocative ""shake that thing"". Other changes include the muting of some parts of the second verse, and the phrase ""butt naked"" becoming ""buck naked"". Such examples of parodies that are included in this video are Michael Jackson, MC Hammer and his hit single ""U Can't Touch This"", Pee Wee Herman, Madonna and the movie ""Bad Santa"", by displaying Eminem as a ""mall santa"" and even going so far to include Tony Cox, the actor who played the elf from the actual movie, as Eminem's helper. Some of the celebrities who appeared in this music video were Paris Hilton, Katie Cassidy, Monica Parales, Erik Estrada, Alyson Stoner, BooBoo Stewart, Omar Benson Miller, De'Angelo Wilson, Mekhi Phifer and Dr. Dre. The video was later nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video, but lost to Ludacris' ""Number One Spot"". Much Music's 50 Most Controversial Videos ranked it #1 for its jokes on famous people. Controversy. The music video for ""Just Lose It"" generated controversy by parodying singer Michael Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984.  A week after the release of ""Just Lose It"", Jackson called into the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. ""I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video,"" Jackson said in the interview. ""I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive."" Jackson continued: ""I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large."" Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who ""watched"" the video and called it ""kicking a man while he's down"" and ""bullshit"", and Steve Harvey, who declared, ""Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back."" The video was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly's ""Tip Drill"" video could be seen. Both were only seen on """".) However MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. "

wikipedia-2271614," Arrayed waveguide grating  Arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) are commonly used as optical (de)multiplexers in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) systems. These devices are capable of multiplexing a large number of wavelengths into a single optical fiber, thereby increasing the transmission capacity of optical networks considerably. The devices are based on a fundamental principle of optics that light waves of different wavelengths interfere linearly with each other. This means that, if each channel in an optical communication network makes use of light of a slightly different wavelength, then the light from a large number of these channels can be carried by a single optical fiber with negligible crosstalk between the channels. The AWGs are used to multiplex channels of several wavelengths onto a single optical fiber at the transmission end and are also used as demultiplexers to retrieve individual channels of different wavelengths at the receiving end of an optical communication network. Operation of AWG devices. Conventional silica-based AWGs schematically shown in the above figure, are planar lightwave circuits fabricated by depositing doped and undoped layers of silica on a silicon substrate. The AWGs consist of a number of input ""(1)"" / output ""(5)"" couplers, a free space propagation region ""(2)"" and ""(4)"" and the grating waveguides ""(3)"". The grating consists of a large number of waveguides with a constant length increment (ΔL). Light is coupled into the device via an optical fiber ""(1)"" connected to the input port. Light diffracting out of the input waveguide at the coupler/slab interface propagates through the free-space region ""(2)"" and illuminates the grating with a Gaussian distribution. Each wavelength of light coupled to the grating waveguides ""(3)"", undergoes a constant change of phase attributed to the constant length increment in grating waveguides. Light diffracted from each waveguide of the grating interferes constructively and gets refocused at the output waveguides ""(5)"", with the spatial position, the output channels, being wavelength dependent on the array phase shift.

wikipedia-2271620," Engineering Council  The Engineering Council (formerly Engineering Council UK) is Britain's regulatory authority for registration of Chartered and Incorporated engineers and technicians, holding a register of these and providing advice to students, engineers, employers and academic institutions on the standards for registration and procedures for registration. It is responsible for the accreditation of educational and training programmes, delegating this responsibility to Licensed Member institutions. History. Professional engineering institutions in the UK began in 1818 with the formation of the internationally-renowned Institution of Civil Engineers. The IMechE was formed next in 1847. The IEE was formed in 1871. These three are known as the ""Big Three"" institutions since together they represent 80% of registered UK engineers. The Joint Council of Engineering Institutions was formed in 1964, which later became the Council of Engineering Institutions (CEI) in November 1965, which had a Royal Charter. This provided all the main functions that the EngC now provides, but was more ineffectual. Around this time, 33% of the UK's GDP was in manufacturing, lowering to 29% in the early 1970s. Finniston report. A Royal Commission, from the Committee of Inquiry into the Engineering Profession, chaired by Sir Monty Finniston, was set up in 1977. It looked at the formation and registration of engineers, producing the Finniston Report - ""Engineering our Future"" in 1980. Engineering institutions thought they may have lost their autonomy. There was also the possibility of statutory licensing (direct government control) of engineers, as other professional practitioners such as doctors, but the work of engineers is more confined to work with other engineering companies, providing a nominal level of inherent professional self-regulation against misconduct. Keith Joseph at the DTI chose not to have a statutory body, but have a Royal Charter. From its recommendations, the Engineering Council was established in 1981, watching over 54 separate institutions. It gained a Royal Charter on 27 November 1981. The first Chairman was Sir Kenneth Corfield, followed by Francis Tombs, Baron Tombs in 1985, Sir William Barlow in 1988, Sir John Fairclough in 1991, Dr Alan Rudge in 1996, Dr Robert Hawley in 1999 It formed The WISE Campaign in 1983 to encourage women to become engineers. In 1996 the diamond logo was replaced by a circle. Function. Engineering Council is recognised by the British Government as the national representative body of the engineering profession in the United Kingdom, working in partnership with other engineering institutions. The Engineering Council regulates the professions of chartered engineer, incorporated engineer and engineering technician in the UK. These professional titles are recognised in Europe with the Directive 2005/36. Professional registration in the UK. UK legislation is generally 'permissive' and, as such, the title ""engineer"" is not protected by law therefore anyone can call themselves an ""engineer"" or ""professional engineer"" or ""registered engineer"" and many semi-skilled and unskilled trades adopt this title. However the 'professional' titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK are protected by law. Registration as a chartered, and incorporated engineers or as engineering technicians is voluntary, and candidates are required to demonstrate a high standard of professional competence acquired through education, training and responsible experience in order to register. There are four categories of registration: Assessment for registration is typically carried out on Engineering Council's behalf by a Licensed Member institution. The Engineering Technician (EngTech) may obtain the Licentiateship (with post nominals LCGI) a City & Guilds Award comparable to a Level 4 qualification. The Incorporated Engineer (IEng) may obtain the Graduateship (GCGI) in Engineering, comparable to a Level 6 qualification. The Chartered Engineer (CEng) may obtain the Membership (MCGI) in Engineering, comparable to a Level 7 qualification. Structure. The office is situated on the A40 in central London next to Holborn tube station, in the London Borough of Camden.  International registration. Engineering Council is a ""designated authority"", under the implementing regulations for Directive 2005/36/EC. Engineering Council is a member of the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) Engineering Council has relationships with many similar organisations worldwide.  It has responsibility for the UK sections of two international registers: European Engineer registration entitles the holder to use the European-style prefix title EurIng; International Professional Engineer registration entitles the holder to use the suffix IntPE (UK). The qualifications required for international registration are similar to those required for CEng registration. "
wikipedia-2271639," Vice President of the Philippines  The Vice President of the Philippines (, informally, ""Ang Pangalawang Pangulo"" or ""Bise Presidente"" derived from Spanish). It is the second-highest executive official of the government of the Philippines, after the President. The official residence and office of the Vice President of the Philippines is the Coconut Palace, CCP Complex, Pasay. Description. The Vice-President of Philippines is the first in the Philippine line of succession, assuming the Presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal by impeachment and subsequent conviction of the incumbent. The position was abolished by Martial Law in 1972, and was not included in the original text of the 1973 Constitution. Amendments to this version restored the position in time for the ""snap"" elections of 1986. The present constitution retains the position. Unlike other countries, the Vice President has no official responsibilities other than those assigned by the incumbent President. Traditions governing the position date back to the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and its inaugural holder, Sergio Osmeña (while there was a similarly named position in governments prior to the First Philippine Republic, the position did not exist under what is considered the first official national government set up in 1898). This includes the Vice President to be given the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio. History. Vice Presidents. The 1935 Constitution of the Philippines established the position of Vice President, with no required responsibilities, although the President could, if he so chose, appoint the Vice President to a cabinet position. The first person elected to the position of Vice President under the constitution was Sergio Osmeña. Elected together with Manuel L. Quezon in the first Philippine national elections, Osmena was given the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio with inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in November 1935. Prior to independence in 1946, that cabinet portfolio was Secretary of Public Instruction, which had once been reserved only for the Vice Governor-General (an American). Vice President Osmena held that position from 1935–1939, and a similar portfolio in the War Cabinet during World War II. After independence, the highest-ranking cabinet position became that of Secretary of Foreign Affairs (it is still the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio in official protocol to this day), which was given to Vice President Elpidio Quirino. Vice President Fernando Lopez declined the Foreign Affairs portfolio when he became Quirino's Vice President in 1949. However, Vice Presidents Carlos P. Garcia and Emmanuel Pelaez also held the Foreign Affairs portfolio, a tradition revived in the Fifth Republic, with Vice Presidents Salvador Laurel and Teofisto Guingona, Jr. holding the Foreign Affairs portfolio. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo served as Secretary of Social Welfare and Development. Other Cabinet positions with no Secretary title was given to Joseph Estrada as Chairman of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission and Noli de Castro as Chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. Alone of the Vice Presidents of the Third Republic, Diosdado Macapagal was not given any cabinet position, since he was the first Vice-President elected who did not come from the same party as the incumbent. Arturo Tolentino was proclaimed Vice President-elect by the Regular Batasang Pambansa in 1986. He took his oath as Vice President February 16, 1986 before Chief Justice Ramon Aquino but, because of popular belief that the elections had been rigged, he never actually served as Vice President. Within a week after Tolentino's oath, the so-called People Power Revolution brought down the Marcos regime. On February 25, 1986 Corazon Aquino and Salvador H. Laurel were sworn in as President and Vice President. Duties and responsibilities. Article VII Section 3 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the existence of a Vice President ""who shall have the same qualifications and term of office and be elected with, and in the same manner, as the President."" The Vice President may be removed from the position in the same manner as the President, and can be appointed as a Member of the Cabinet. The Vice President shall be put into office by direct popular vote held every second Monday of May (or as provided otherwise by law) for a term of six years which starts at noon of June 30 the year the official was elected, and will end at noon of the same date six years after. Section 4 states that the Vice President is not allowed to serve two consecutive terms, and if any case the official renounces his position in the duration of his term, it will not be considered as an interruption in the term for which he was elected. He/She also assumes the duties and responsibilities of the President (as Acting President) if (1) the position of the latter has not yet been chosen, until such has been chosen and qualified, (2) the latter has died or became permanently disabled, and will serve the unexpired term, and/or (3) the Members of the Cabinet submits to the Senate President and the House Speaker a written declaration that the President is unable to effect his responsibilities and duties. Succession. The vice president is the first in the presidential line of succession as mandated in the 1987 constitution. Succession in case of the incapacitation or death of the President of the Philippines has occurred thrice: A Vice President has become President by virtue of resignation: Privileges of office. Salary. The salary of the Vice President ranges from P103,000 to P111,917 a month, that is determined by the Congress. Official residence. Historically, the Vice President was not given an official residence. However, the Vice President also held office along with the President at the Executive Building (now Kalayaan Hall) in the complex of Malacañan Palace from 1935 until 1972, when the position was abolished under martial law and the 1973 Constitution. When the position was reinstated, Vice President Salvador H. Laurel held office at the former Legislative Building at Padre Burgos Avenue, Manila, until the building became the National Museum of the Philippines. The Vice President's office was transferred to the Philippine International Convention Center, and again to the PNB Financial Center in Pasay, Metro Manila in 2005. Incumbent Vice President Jejomar Binay has designated the Coconut Palace in Pasay City as the official residence and principal workplace of the Vice President of the Philippines. Land transport. The Vice President of the Philippines uses a Mercedes Benz W140 S-Class, backed up by the Presidential Security Group. Living Vice Presidents. Five Vice Presidents, the incumbent and four former Vice Presidents, are currently living:  "

It was released as the fifth and final single from his 2004 album, ""Encore"". Critical reception. Allmusic wrote: ""Here, Eminem is plain-spoken and literal, intent on refuting every critic from Benzino at The Source to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who gets an entire song (""Ass Like That"") devoted to him."" DX editor J-23 was divided: """"Ass Like That"" is gonna be a song you either love or hate. Whatever the case, it sure is surreal to hear him rap an entire song as that Triumph puppet from MTV."" Pitchfork was positive: ""Em also shines when he spins well off his axis (...) the R. Kelly/Triumph the Insult Comic Dog-baiting ""Ass Like That"" but he noted that he song sounds like mixtape. NME magazine was proud: ""silly, groin-levelled doodle that demonstrates both producer and rhymer aren’t just on autopilot, they’re having a nice snooze in the cockpit while the plane plummets towards Earth. Or to put it another way, this track is undercooked juvenile shite."" USA Today wrote that ""On the lighter side, he name-drops the likes of Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen on Ass Like That."" RapReviews noted that ""In ""Ass Like That"" Slim impersonates Triumph the Insult Comic Dog for three perverse verses of ogling over the Olsen twins and booty bashing Hilary Duff."" Stylus Magazine was negative: "" “Ass Like That”, Em’s “response” to Triumph, fares better, and actually makes a pretty salient point about Hollywood’s fetishization of barely legal starlets, but then you realize that it’s AN ANSWER RECORD TO AN AWARDS SHOW BEEF WITH A HAND PUPPET and suddenly you’re not even able to make eye contact with the album cover anymore"" and he added it does flash some Eminem’s once-patented lyrical venom. Music video. The music video was released on May 20, 2005. The video begins with the instrumental to Evil Deeds (the second song from Encore) playing in the background as famous people exit a limo, walking down a red carpet with fans off to the side. Eminem is the last to come out and as the news reporters ask him a question, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog interrupts by asking ""As a dog, I must know, what does Dr. Dre's ass smell like?"". The crowd gasps and Triumph continues to insult Eminem by saying ""You are so cute and small, no wonder Elton John loves you. You come up to his waist!"" (alluding to John's homosexuality and friendship with Eminem). Eminem shakes off the remark and attempts to answer the question originally posed to him by the reporter when Triumph once again interjects: ""Do you kiss 50 Cent with that mouth?"" Eminem swiftly punches Triumph and wrestles several security guards to the ground. In the scuffle as Eminem appears to be trying to choke Triumph, Triumph shouts out ""I'm not your wife!"" (alluding to Eminem's troubled relationship with his daughter's mother, Kim). The puppet dog becomes attached to Eminem's hand as the scuffle continues, and as it is broken up Eminem stands up with Triumph to sing the chorus of the song. The video then switches between the ""real world"" and the ""puppet world"". There are puppet versions of many of the celebrities Eminem makes fun of (listed above), as well as Nick Lachey. The puppets from Crank Yankers also make an appearance, including: Elmer Higgins, Terrence Catheter, Birchum, Special Ed, Bobby Fletcher, Niles Standish, Spoonie Luv, Hadassah Guberman. Puppet versions of Dr. Dre and 50 Cent are also featured. A censored version of the song was featured in the movie ""Drillbit Taylor"" and briefly in HBO's ""You're Welcome America"". He sang an altered version of the song in the New York Tour DVD. "
wikipedia-2271673," Multi-master replication  Multi-master replication is a method of database replication which allows data to be stored by a group of computers, and updated by any member of the group. All members are responsive to client data queries. The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group, and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members. Multi-master replication can be contrasted with master-slave replication, in which a single member of the group is designated as the ""master"" for a given piece of data and is the only node allowed to modify that data item. Other members wishing to modify the data item must first contact the master node. Allowing only a single master makes it easier to achieve consistency among the members of the group, but is less flexible than multi-master replication. Multi-master replication can also be contrasted with failover clustering where passive slave servers are replicating the master data in order to prepare for takeover in the event that the master stops functioning. The master is the only server active for client interaction. The primary purposes of multi-master replication are increased availability and faster server response time. Methods. Log-Based. A database transaction log is referenced to capture changes made to the database. Trigger-Based. Triggers at the subscriber capture changes made to the database and submit them to the publisher. With trigger-based transaction capturing, database changes can be distributed either synchronously or asynchronously. Implementations. Directory services. Many directory servers based on LDAP implement multi-master replication. Active Directory. One of the more prevalent multi-master replication implementations in directory servers is Microsoft's Active Directory. Within Active Directory, objects that are updated on one Domain Controller are then replicated to other domain controllers through multi-master replication. It is not required for all domain controllers to replicate with each other domain controller as this would cause excessive network traffic in large Active Directory deployments. Instead, domain controllers have a complex update pattern that ensures that all servers are updated in a timely fashion without excessive replication traffic. Some Active Directory needs are however better served by Flexible single master operation. Hierarchical framework of objects Resources Services  users Provides information on objects Help organize these objects Help perform security functions CA Directory. CA Directory supports multi-master replication. OpenDS/OpenDJ. OpenDS (and its successor product OpenDJ) implemented multi-master since version 1.0. The OpenDS/OpenDJ multi-master replication is asynchronous, it uses a log with a publish-subscribe mechanism that allows scaling to a large number of nodes. OpenDS/OpenDJ replication does conflict resolution at the entry and attribute level. OpenDS/OpenDJ replication can be used over a Wide Area Network. OpenLDAP. The widely used open source LDAP server implements multi-master replication since its version 2.4 (October 2007) [http://www.openldap.org/software/roadmap.html]. Database Management Systems. Qualified relational database management systems also provide multi-master replication. MySQL. MariaDB and MySQL ships with replication support. It is possible to achieve a multi-master replication scheme beginning with MySQL version 3.23.  MySQL Cluster supports conflict detection and resolution between multiple masters since version 6.3 for true multi-master capability for the MySQL Server  There is also an external project, Galera Cluster created by codership, that provides true multi-master capability, based on a fork of the InnoDB storage engine and custom replication plug-ins PostgreSQL. The replication documentation for PostgreSQL categorises the different types of replication and identifies only one third party solution, Bucardo, as supporting multi-master replication. However the following third-party packages also support multi-master replication for PostgreSQL: rubyrep, PgCluster and PostgresXC as well as some proprietary solutions. Ingres. Within Ingres Replicator, objects that are updated on one Ingres server can then be replicated to other servers whether local or remote through multi-master replication. If one server fails, client connections can be re-directed to another server. It is not required for all Ingres servers in an environment to replicate with each other as this could cause excessive network traffic in large implementations. Instead, Ingres Replicator allows the appropriate data to be replicated to the appropriate servers without excessive replication traffic. This means that some servers in the environment can serve as failover candidates while other servers can meet other requirements such as managing a subset of columns or tables for a departmental solution, a subset of rows for a geographical region or one-way replication for a reporting server. In the event of a source, target, or network failure, data integrity is enforced through this two-phase commit protocol by ensuring that either the whole transaction is replicated, or none of it is. In addition, Ingres Replicator can operate over RDBMS’s from multiple vendors to connect them. "
wikipedia-2271683," Dave Nilsson  David Wayne Nilsson (born 14 December 1969) is an Australian retired professional baseball player who played as catcher for Major League Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers from to . He was an All-Star in 1999, becoming the first Australian player to appear in an All-Star game. He ended his Major League career on 3 October 1999 with 837 games played, 789 hits, 105 home runs and a .284 career batting average. Nilsson was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2008. Nilsson became a free agent in the offseason following , but opted not to sign with any MLB teams because of his desire to play for Australia in the 2000 Olympics. He was widely applauded for this move as he was turning down big money to represent his country, something very rarely seen in baseball. Before leaving the US, he had been Australia's second highest earning sportsman behind Greg Norman, according to the ""Business Review Weekly"".  Nilsson previously played for the Brisbane Bandits and Melbourne Reds in the now-defunct Australian Baseball League where he holds the record for all time batting average (.351) and all time slugging average (.661). His brothers Gary, Bob and Ron also played in the competition. He also played in the Japanese NPB and Italian Serie A. He went on to also represent Australia in the 2004 Olympics where they won a historic silver medal, and also represented his country in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. He is currently head coach of the Australian MLB Academy. Nilsson represented Australia at the Olympics in 2000 and 2004, and has been involved in the strategic direction of the sport in Australia. He had been owner of the International Baseball League of Australia before it went bankrupt. Early life. Nilsson was born in Brisbane, Queensland. Playing career. Minor Leagues. Nilsson was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers in January 1987 at the age of 17 as an amateur free agent. He made his professional debut that year with the Helena Brewers, batting .394. Nilsson ranked third in the Pioneer League in batting average but was left off the league All-Star Team at catcher in favor of Frank Colston, who hit .397. ""Baseball America"" rated Nilsson the #2 prospect in the league. In 1988 he made his debut for the Queensland Rams in the Claxton Shield where he won MVP of the tournament. He then went on to play full season A ball for the Beloit Brewers and in the off-season played for the Gold Coast Clippers in the newly formed Australian Baseball League. In 1989 he moved to the affiliate, the Stockton Ports but struggled with the bat and failed to make an impact. In the 1990 California League season, Nilsson had a significant improvement and helped the Stockton Ports win the title and ""Baseball America"" rated him the 8th best prospect in the league. Back in the ABL, Nilsson batted at .400 with the Daikyo Dolphins, only averaging behind fellow Brewers player John Jaha. Along with brother Bob, he helped Daikyo finish 31–9, best in the league. Nilsson was named to the league All-Star team at catcher and won the MVP Award. He returned to the US at the age of 22 with the El Paso Diablos in AA batting with an average of .413 and was promoted to the AAA Denver Zephyrs before the end of the season. Nilsson was named as one of the two Texas League All-Star catchers that season alongside Ivan Rodriguez. ""Baseball America"" named Nilsson the league's #4 prospect after Rodriguez, Royce Clayton and Raul Mondesi. In the winter he helped Daikyo win the 1991–92 ABL season. Major League. After continuing to bat well for Denver in 1992, Nilsson was called up to the Brewers and batted in the 9 hole while playing catcher. Despite striking out in his first at bat, he redeemed himself later that game with a three-run double. Nilsson was one of the 10 youngest players in the 1992 American League in his first season. After performing below par in the 1992–93 ABL season, Nilsson was the most frequently used catcher for the 1993 Brewers, but due to injury problems, had rehab stints in the minors. On 11 April 1994, Nilsson hit the first home run at Rangers Ballpark in the fifth inning of the first game played there. He also grounded into the first double-play recorded at the ballpark, scored 1-6-3. On 14 April 1994, Nilsson and Graeme Lloyd formed the first all-Australian battery in an MLB game.  In the 1994 off-season, Nilsson moved to the Brisbane Bandits and played very well in the regular season averaging .362 and slugging .695. Nilsson homered off his first swing of the season that year. He was named to the league All-Star team at catcher. Milwaukee had originally requested that Nilsson be returned to the team in time for spring training but they later decided to let him stay for the playoffs. He helped Brisbane to an upset win over the Sydney Blues for the championship; he formed a battery with his brother Gary for the final inning of the last round.  Later that year Nilsson had his first full major league season, producing a .275 batting average and .451 slugging average and won Brewers Player of the Year. He then returned to Australia after signing a five-year deal with the Waverly Reds where he played 54 games in the 1994–95 ABL season, leading in batting average (.388), on base average (.471) and slugging average (.775). Nilsson was again named as the All-Star catcher and led Waverly to their second title and Nilsson's third. Nilsson contracted Ross River Fever while playing winter ball and missed the first two months of the 1995 Major League Baseball season, but after hitting over .400 in three rehab stints, he returned to the Brewers later in the season but was used primarily as a corner outfielder rather than catcher. Despite being a part owner of the team, Nilsson came to regret his five-year deal with Waverly as he missed his hometown of Brisbane and tried to negotiate a way out of the contract. The dispute lasted six months with the Reds finally coming to the agreement he would play out the rest of the 1995–96 ABL season before returning to Brisbane. In limited appearances, Nilsson contributed a meager .250 with the bat. He returned to the MLB late again that season due to a broken foot, but had a productive year by setting his MLB career highs in average (.331) and OBP (.407) while still slugging at .525. He hit 33 doubles and 17 home runs, scored 81 runs and drove in 84 in 123 games. He was 6th in the 1996 AL in batting average. On 17 May 1996, Nilsson became the first Milwaukee Brewer to hit two home runs in the same inning (the 6th, vs. Minnesota Twins, in a 12–1 victory). Nilsson became a player-manager for the Brisbane Bandits for the 1996–97 ABL season. Although knee surgery cut his season short, he guided the team to the finals with a batting average of .420 which, had he played enough games, would have led the ABL that year. He returned to the US where he batted .278 for the season with 20 home runs playing first base, left field and DH. That off season he did not return to the ABL for the first time due to injuries. In the 1998 season he batted at a discouraging .269 mark for the Brewers. Nilsson was only 29 years old when he played his last major league season, hitting a 309/.400/.554 clip with 21 home runs for the 1999 Milwaukee Brewers season. He was also fit enough to play catcher regularly for the club for the first time in five years. In the 1999 All-Star Game, he replaced Mike Lieberthal as the National League catcher, becoming the first Australian to play in a Major League Baseball All-Star Game (the only other is Grant Balfour of the Oakland A's in 2013). Stardom in international competitions. In 1999, Nilsson played in the Intercontinental Cup where he hit a .379/.457/.517 clip to win tournament MVP and help Australia win its first gold medal at an international baseball event. Nilsson was third in average behind Akinori Iwamura and Claudio Liverziani and made the tournament All-Star team at catcher. So that he could represent Australia in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he became a free agent after the 1999 MLB season and signed with the Chunichi Dragons in the NPB. He only hit .180 for Chunichi and was demoted to the minors, then released. While in Japan, he was registered as ""Dingo"" as players in NPB can choose what name should appear on their jerseys. Later in 1999 he bought the Australian Baseball League and renamed it the International Baseball League of Australia. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics had his best-ever international tournament averaging .565 and slugging .957 as a DH/1B. He led the Olympics in average that year, 151 points ahead of runner-up Doug Mientkiewicz as well as also leading in both slugging and OBP. Despite his excellent performance, Australia finished just 2–5, ahead of only South Africa. Nilsson was offered a contract after the Olympics by the Boston Red Sox but the offer was withdrawn due to Nilsson failing a physical on his left knee. Later years. After a two-year break from baseball, Nilsson signed a contract with the Red Sox on 21 January 2003 and was expected to play in the 2003 MLB season with a $400,000 contract. However, on 14 February it was announced that Nilsson had decided against playing after losing the will to play.  Nilsson managed the Queensland Rams in the 2003 Claxton Shield, assisting them to a surprise title. He returned to playing baseball that year for Telemarket Rimini in Serie A1 in Italy, where, although only hitting .280, he ended up slugging at a league-high of .920 and had an OBP of .561. Nilsson played in the Australian season for the first time in five years when he appeared in the 2004 Claxton Shield. He went 5 for 11 with 4 home runs and 12 RBI and even pitched well in one stint on the mound. He led the 2004 Shield in home runs and RBI and was named to the All-Star team at DH. Nilsson then again attempted a comeback in the major leagues. He signed with the Atlanta Braves and hit .236 in 16 games for the Richmond Braves, five years after he had last played in the Major Leagues. Nilsson was back with the Australian national baseball team for the 2004 Athens Olympics. He again had a decent tournament performance batting .296/.441/.444 in 8 games. He had a perfect fielding percentage at catcher and threw out 5-of-8 attempted base-stealers. Nilsson's career ended when he went 0-for-5 with a strikeout for Australia in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. In 2008 Nilsson was named to the Sports Australia Hall of Fame. He entered the Hall of Fame with swimmer Ian Thorpe, Winter Olympics gold medalist Alisa Camplin, rugby league champion Allan Langer, tennis player Mark Woodforde, Australian football and media identity Lou Richards, and swimming coach John Carew. Personal. Nilsson currently lives in Brisbane, Australia and was manager of the Brisbane Bandits of the Australian Baseball League for the 2010-11 season. "

It was released as the fourth single from his fourth studio album ""The Eminem Show"", on February 25, 2003. The song uses the chorus of ""Dream On"". Background. The song uses a sample from the song ""Dream On"" by rock group Aerosmith. Joe Perry of Aerosmith plays the guitar solo at the end of the song, and a sample of Steven Tyler singing the chorus of ""Dream On"" is used as the chorus for this song, and Eminem says ""sing"" when Tyler starts to sing the chorus and Eminem also says ""sing with me"" and ""come on"" in the chorus. Eminem says those words on his live performances too. The song also contained an interpolation of ""Dream On"" at the beginning of the song. ""Sing for the Moment"" was later released on Eminem's greatest hits album """". ""Sing for the Moment"" deals with the themes of rap music's effect on society and the misunderstanding Eminem claims critics and parents have towards his message. Eminem uses the song to refute critics who have accused him of promoting violence to young people, saying that committing a crime is ultimately up to the offender. He also explains that his music has an advantage to young people, claiming that his music is a relief from boredom and depression. Eminem's altercation with a bouncer named John Guerrera is also referenced in this song. The song reached #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, #6 on the UK Singles Chart, and #5 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart. Critical reception. David Browne cited: ""In ""Sing for the Moment,"" which includes a tirade against the media and politically motivated prosecutors, the intensity of his delivery overcomes the hoariest of ideas -- incorporating a portion of an overly familiar classic-rock oldie, Aerosmith's ""Dream On."" The song becomes a clarion call of suburban kids everywhere, not just an easy route to a hit."" DX magazine concluded that in this song Eminem is dealing with his life and he called it ""guitar-fueled track."" RapReviews was positive: """"Sing For the Moment"" may throw his fans a curveball though: a song which appears to sample Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" yet simultaneously features the REAL Joe Perry playing guitar. Obviously not a stretch for the hard rock icons though, who are still remembered for recording ""Walk This Way"" with Run-D.M.C. back in the 1980's, so it's an enjoyable diversion from non-stop hardcore hip-hop."" Music video. The music video released in 2003, is a collage created with various clips, including shots from the Anger Management Tour. It also contains cameos appearances by various fellow rappers, including Dr. Dre, the members from D12, 50 Cent and Ludacris. Eminem stands in neutral positions and stares at the camera several times in the video. The video is very similar to the 50 Cent music video ""If I Can't"". On The Eminem Show, ""Sing for the Moment"" segues into ""Superman"". On , the segue also fades out as ""Superman"", since Superman is not included the compilation.

He is a multi-instrumentalist, who has played saxophone and keyboards, although he is best known as a guitarist. He is also known for preferring the sound of a sixpence to a plectrum. Bairnson grew up Levenwick in Shetland before his family moved to Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland when he was nine years old following the death of his father. He was a session guitarist before joining up in 1973 with former Bay City Rollers musicians David Paton and Billy Lyall in the band, Pilot, and contributed the harmony guitar parts to their hit single, ""Magic"". During this time with Pilot, he first collaborated with Alan Parsons, the record producer on their debut self-titled album. It was this relationship that helped incorporate most of the band's members (bassist/lead singer Paton and drummer Stuart Tosh) into the Alan Parsons Project. He played the distinctive guitar solo on the track ""I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You"" from Parsons' ""I Robot"" (1977) album. As a guitarist, he has been featured on every Project album, including the 1984 side project Keats. He has played on Kate Bush's first five albums ""The Kick Inside"" (1978) (notably playing the guitar solo on ""Wuthering Heights""), ""Lionheart"" (1978), ""Never for Ever"" (1980) and ""The Dreaming"" (1982).

He has toured with a number of different bands, the latest being Junk (Bairnson, Jesús Gabaldón, Pau Chaffer, Sarah Rope and Ángel Celada). "
wikipedia-2271744," Business rule management system  A BRMS or Business Rule Management System is a software system used to define, deploy, execute, monitor and maintain the variety and complexity of decision logic that is used by operational systems within an organization or enterprise. This logic, also referred to as business rules, includes policies, requirements, and conditional statements that are used to determine the tactical actions that take place in applications and systems. Overview. A BRMS includes, at minimum : The top benefits of a BRMS include: Some disadvantages of the BRMS include: Most BRMS vendors have evolved from rule engine vendors to provide business-usable software development lifecycle solutions, based on declarative definitions of business rules executed in their own rule engine.  However, some vendors come from a different approach (for example, they map decision trees or graphs to executable code). Rules in the repository are generally mapped to decision services that are naturally fully compliant with the latest SOA, Web Services, or other software architecture trends. Related software approaches. In a BRMS, a representation of business rules maps to a software system for execution. A BRMS therefore relates to model-driven engineering, such as the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) of the Object Management Group (OMG). It is no coincidence that many of the related standards come under the OMG banner. Associated standards. There is no current implementation standard for business rules defined within a BRMS, although there is a standard for a Java Runtime API for rule engines JSR-94.  Other standards (under development) include: Many standards, such as domain-specific languages, define their own representation of rules, requiring translations to generic rule engines or their own custom engines.  Other domains, such as PMML, also define rules.  RuleML provides a (mostly academic) family of mark-up languages that could be used in a BRMS, but are usually used for research purposes. "

Remixes & Mashups. Two remixes of the song feature as European bonus tracks on the ""Straight from the Lab"" mixtape later released as a compilation: a Drum and bass remix and a ""Religious remix"" entitled ""(God is) Cleanin' Out My Closet"". In the mashup video ""Atomic Closet"" (a fusion of Eminem's original ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and Blondie's ""Atomic""), Blondie's hit was heavily sampled as the background song, with Eminem rapping throughout. The video was directed by Dr. Dre and Philip Atwell.  The B side ""Stimulate"" appears on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the soundtrack ""Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture 8 Mile"", and also appears on ""Straight from the Lab"". Cover versions. In October 2012, New York City hip hop artist Angel Haze released a reworked version of Cleanin' Out My Closet using her own lyrics, in which she graphically recounts her experience with childhood sexual abuse.

wikipedia-2271767," Lorraine Franconian  Lorraine Franconian (Lorraine Franconian: ""Plàtt"", ""lottrìnger Plàtt""; ; ) is a designation, in practice ambiguous, for dialects of West Central German (), a group of High German dialects spoken in the Moselle département in the north-eastern French region of Lorraine.  The term ""Lorraine Franconian"" has multiple denotations. Some scholars use it to refer to the entire group of West Central German dialects spoken in the French Lorraine region. Others use it more narrowly to refer to the Moselle Franconian dialect spoken in the valley of the river Nied (in Pays du Nied, whose largest town is Bouzonville), to distinguish it from the other two Franconian dialects spoken in Lorraine, Luxembourgish to the west and Rhine Franconian to the east.  In part due to the ambiguity of the term, estimations of the number of speakers of Lorraine Franconian in France vary widely, ranging from 30,000 to 400,000 (which would make it the 3rd most-spoken regional language in France, after Occitan and Alsatian).  The most reliable data come from the ""Enquête famille"" carried out by INSEE as part of the 1999 census, but they give a somewhat indirect picture of the current situation (see Languages in France for a discussion of this survey). Approximately 78,000 people were reported to speak Lorraine Franconian, but fewer than 50,000 passed basic knowledge of the language on to their children. Another statistic illustrating the same point: Of all adult men who used Franconian regularly at age 5, less than 30% use (or used) the language regularly with their own children. "
wikipedia-2271811," Five dots tattoo  The five dots tattoo is a tattoo of five dots arranged in a quincunx, usually on the outer surface of the hand, between the thumb and the index finger. The tattoo has different meanings in different cultures—it has been variously interpreted as a fertility symbol, a reminder of sayings on how to treat women or police, a recognition symbol among the Romani people, a group of close friends, standing alone in the world, or time spent in prison (with the outer four dots representing the prison walls and the inner dot representing the prisoner). Thomas Edison, whose many inventions included a tattooing machine, had this pattern tattooed on his forearm. Portugal. The five dot pattern occurs on the five shields (themselves arranged in a quincunx) on the flag of Portugal, which represent the five Holy Wounds inflicted upon Jesus during his crucifixion. In American and Canadian prisons the tattoo is worn by many Portuguese-North American inmates. This tattoo was also sometimes formerly worn by members of the Portuguese army on the hand or shoulder. It is also prevalent as a Portuguese-American and Portuguese-Canadian street tattoo. Europe. In France, Romania and Greece, tattoos of a quincunx, placed on the hand between index finger and thumb are found on prison inmates. United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the quincunx tattoo, on the web between thumb and forefinger, is a prison tattoo reflecting the view of women by those wearing it - ""Find Her, Follow Her, Finger Her, Fuck Her, Forget Her."" United States. In the United States, the five dot tattoo could mean you are a member of the Blood or People Nation gangs that represent the points on the five-pointed star. It is usually put on the left hand.  It is also a tattoo common for the Oriental Troop gang. The Oriental Troops are Crip-affiliated, but the five dots also represent the ""5"" in ""15,"" which represents the fifteenth letter of the alphabet: ""O"" for ""Oriental."" Also, in the ""Oriental Culture"", the five dots represent ""Health, Wealth, Family, Love, and Respect"". It is also a tattoo for Vietnamese gang members. The five dots stand for the five ts, which are, Tình, Tiền, Tù, Tội, Thù, which translates to ""love, money, prison, crime, revenge"". Five dot tattoos also represents a senior gang member or ""OG"": ""original gangster"". The original three dots represent the wearer and the homies gangbanging with each other. Adding two more dots represents a gangster who earns the right to command others: the wearer surrounded by others in protection. Russia. In the Russian criminal world five dot tattoos are placed on the hand of an inmate. It stands for ""I will not forget prison"". This is also the Armenian meaning. South America. The central dot represents a police or prison officer surrounded by four inmates. This comes from the fact that inmates have faced the opposite: lying on the ground while surrounded by four police officers. The tattoo represents a vow to have a 'cop' in the same situation. "
wikipedia-2271813," European Research Council  The European Research Council (ERC) is the independent body that funds investigator-driven frontier research in the European Union (EU). It is part of the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7). The Council supports all disciplines, from the biological and physical sciences to engineering and the humanities. It was formally launched in February 2007 by a common action of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council. Created to provide a new source and philosophy for competitive funding, based on peer-reviewed excellence as the sole criterion for success, the ERC is aiming to set new standards and create a level playing field for research across a diverse continent of 500 million people in 39 countries with a collective economy of €15 trillion. The ERC is an inclusive institution that seeks excellence irrespective of nationality, gender, or location. History. The idea of having a funding mechanism for basic research at the EU level has been discussed and supported among European scientists for a long time. However, its realisation was held back at the political level because the European Treaty, which is the document that forms the legal basis of the EU, was interpreted as allowing EU funding only to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry – that is, only funding for applied research rather than basic research. In conjunction with the Lisbon declaration in 2000, leaders of the EU, in particular the European Commissioner for Research at the time, Philippe Busquin, realised that the European Treaty had to be reinterpreted; a transformation of European economy from traditional manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy has to involve the enhanced support at the European level for science of all kinds, including fundamental science as well as applied science. Several important initiatives, which paved the way for the ERC, were taken at the beginning of the century by a number of organisations and individuals and a series of communications in the scientific literature laid out the need for a research council in Europe. In 2002, a high-level expert group was commissioned to explore the possibilities of creating an ERC. This group concluded that the EU should establish an ERC to support basic research. A number of other expert groups, such as one commissioned by the European Science Foundation, another charged with the task of analysing the economic implications of the Lisbon declaration and a high level group commissioned by the European Commission, also arrived at a similar conclusion and boosted the idea of establishing an ERC. With the ice broken, scientists and politicians have since strongly supported the establishment of an ERC. In 2006, the European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers accepted the Seventh Framework Programme for the European Union's support for research, of which the ERC was a part. In the ERC kick-off conference in Berlin, various speakers talked of 'an idea whose time has come', 'a European factory of ideas', 'a champions' league’, 'a great day for Europe and a great day for science', and the beginning of a 'snowball effect'. Governance & structure. The ERC is governed by the Scientific Council (ScC), consisting of 22 eminent European scientists and scholars, and supported operationally by the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), based in Brussels. The ScC is responsible for setting the ERC's scientific strategy including establishing the annual 'Ideas' Work Programme and calls for proposals, designing the peer review systems, identifying the peer review experts, and communicating with the scientific community. The Scientific Council members were nominated by Commissioner Potočnik in July 2005 and worked intensively to define the key principles and scientific operating practices of the ERC in preparation for the start-up. Following its formal establishment, the Scientific Council reaffirmed the election of its Chair and ERC president, Professor Fotis Kafatos, and the two Vice-Chairs and ERC Vice-Presidents, Professor Helga Nowotny and Dr. Daniel Estève. After the resignation of Fotis Kafatos in February 2010, Helga Nowotny was elected president. Since March 2011, Vice-Presidents are Prof. Carl-Henrik Heldin and Prof. Pavel Exner. The second pillar of the ERC, the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), is responsible for supporting the peer review process, implementing ERC strategy as set by the ScC, and executing all financial operations. The ERCEA is currently headed by its Director, Pablo Amor. It employs some 350 staff of which more than 50 are PhD scientists. To couple the two pillars and create an integrated institution, two integrative mechanisms were put in place: There is also a five-member ERCEA Steering Committee, chaired by the EC's Director-General for Research Robert Jan Smits and including a distinguished external scientist (currently Catherine Cesarsky), a ScC member, and two senior EC officers. During the first half of 2011, a Task Force chaired by Robert Jan Smits, decided to give further suggestions regarding the governance structure of the ERC in the next European Commission's Framework Programme (Horizon 2020), beginning with 2014. Inter alia, it was suggested to merge the positions of the President and of the Secretary General into a full-time employed president in Brussels. Budget. The ERC budget is guaranteed at €7.51 billion for 2007–2013, the duration of the EC's 7th Framework Programme. It provided €300 million in 2007 and will increase by ~€250 million each year, reaching just under €1.8 billion for 2013. The ERC budget is supported by the European Commission and is supplemented by contributions from states associated with but not currently members of the EU (the associated countries). Together, the 27 EU member states and the 12 associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA) (http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html). Founding principles: Frontier research based on peer-reviewed excellence. The first founding principle of the ERC is that research grant applications should be judged using the sole criterion of peer-reviewed excellence, independent of political, geographic or economic considerations. All ERC calls for funding are open to nationals of any country in the world, as long as they are committed to work primarily in Europe. The quality and originality of the research project and the qualifications of the applicant, as shown, for example, by their publication record, are the only evaluation criteria. This means that there will be no ""juste retour"", in other words there are no guarantees that the individual countries contributing to the programme will receive any part of the funding. The second founding principle of the ERC is to target frontier research by encouraging high-risk, high-reward proposals that may revolutionise science and potentially lead to innovation if successful. The ScC does not pre-select the frontiers, but challenges applicants to identify and pursue them. It then entrusts the evaluation panels to select the best, most promising proposals. Funding is provided for individual projects initiated in an investigator-driven, ‘bottom‑up’ process. Although collaborations within a project are welcome, there is no formal demand to collaborate. The ERC asks researchers to think big, and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects, or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The grants are flexible, so that all costs for a specific project can be covered, making rebudgeting of the grant money possible during the duration of the grant. In addition, the grants are portable, meaning that if scientists move to another university or institute, the grant moves with them. Types of grants offered. The ERC offers several core grant schemes: ERC ""Starting Grants"" support up-and-coming independent research leaders of any nationality with: (*) Allowance is provided for time spent on career breaks, parental leave and national service. Further, the ERC panels are encouraged to be open to excellent and promising candidates with ""unconventional"" careers. Consolidator grant  Synergy grant ERC ""Advanced Grants"" (AdG) support outstanding advanced researchers of any nationality with: For information about submitting an ERC grant proposal, see here. ERC peer review. The ERC's peer-review evaluation process must command the confidence of the research community and is central to the achievement of the ERC's objectives. The ERC ScC divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted to each based on the weighted average distribution of national funding in scientifically strong countries worldwide: 34% for life sciences, 14% for social sciences/humanities and 39% for physical/engineering sciences. The ScC strongly encourages interdisciplinary proposals, for which a notional 13% of the budget is reserved, if sufficient top-quality proposals are submitted. The ERC philosophy towards interdisciplinary proposals is to apply ""mainstreaming"", i.e. to have them reviewed by sufficiently knowledgeable panellists and/or external reviewers but to ultimately rank them competitively within their primary panel. Clearly, identifying and rewarding true interdisciplinarity is a challenging yet worthwhile task and one would expect that the ERC, being a novel and learning organisation, would likely adapt and refine its procedures vis-a-vis the treatment of interdisciplinary proposals as experience is gained. The peer review in the three domains is carried out by a total of 25 panels led by Panel Chairs whose scientific status gives credibility to the selection process. The configuration of the evaluation panels was finalised by the Scientific Council during the first semester of 2008, taking account of the experience from the first Starting Grant call. For the Advanced Grant, two sets of panels have been put in place, operating in alternate years. This moderates the workload on individual reviewers and means that they are not excluded from applying to the ERC on alternate years when they are not involved in panels. There are currently thus about 900 ERC panel members; together with the 2000 external reviewers they constitute the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure. Relations with stakeholders in Europe. By its existence, the ERC aims to enhance the performance of the European research system. The ERC and national funding bodies have important objectives in common – improving the climate for frontier research in Europe and the attractiveness of the European research environment. The Scientific Council has been keen to learn from the ERC’s peers in national research councils (European and overseas) and to engage in dialogue and appropriate collaboration. The ERC has already benefited from the support of national funding agencies, both in seconding national experts to its Executive Agency, and providing expert support to assist in the Starting Grant evaluation. Open access. The Scientific Council has engaged actively in the debate on access and availability of publications and research results. It has adopted an ‘open access’ policy by requiring that all peer-reviewed publications from ERC-funded research projects are deposited in the appropriate Internet-accessible libraries within 6 months of publication.

wikipedia-2271827," My Name Is  ""My Name Is"" is a song by Eminem released in 1999. It is the debut single overall from his major label debut album, ""The Slim Shady LP"". The song was ranked at #26 on ""VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's"". ""My Name Is"" also was ranked #6 on Q Magazine's ""1001 Best Songs Ever"". Debuting on January 21, 1999, the ""My Name Is"" music video eventually reached the #1 position on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL), making Eminem the first rapper to reach the top spot. Background. Producer Dr. Dre wanted to use a sample of Labi Siffre's ""I Got The ..."" for the rhythm track; as revealed in the sleeve notes of the re-mastered CD of the source album, ""Remember My Song"", Siffre, who is openly gay, stated, ""attacking two of the usual scapegoats, women and gays, is lazy writing. If you want to do battle, attack the aggressors not the victims."" Eminem made lyric changes and Siffre cleared the sample. There are currently three different versions available. The ""clean"" and ""explicit"" versions are available on iTunes. There is also another version which is more explicit than the one available on iTunes, released as the B-side to ""Guilty Conscience"" on the CD single. The Explicit version on iTunes contains reverb on the backing vocals - the kids voice - in the beginning of the song while the backing vocals on the clean version does not. During the time the song was released, Eminem and Insane Clown Posse were having a ""rap feud"". After the release of this song, Insane Clown Posse parodied this song with a song called ""Slim Anus"". ""My Name Is"" was later re-released in 2005, on Eminem's compilation album, """". The song is mixed with Jay-Z's song ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"" and Beck's song ""Loser"" on the video game DJ Hero. Eminem also made a remix of it, using the most explicit version, over the top of AC/DC's ""Back In Black"". Before the Slim Shady LP was released, an uncensored version was available on the Internet. The original lyrics on the dirty version of the song were: ""Extra-terrestrial, killing pedestrians / Raping lesbians while they're screaming, 'Let's just be friends!' The version on the CD was changed to ""Extra-terrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship / While they're screaming at me, 'Let's just be friends!' There's also a line that was changed from ""My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high / The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy"" to ""My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high / Thanks a lot; next semester, I'll be 35."" Critical response. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted it, Rolling Stone wasn't that positive: ""Eminem is on some serious Dangerfield shit in loser anthems like ""My Name Is."" David Browne described this single as: ""the attention-grabbing single and video, ""My Name Is."" ""Piero Scaruffi wrote that this song highlights his ""carefree and sarcastic attitude."""""" Music video. The video was directed by Phillip Atwell which would later direct the music videos for Eminem's Stan, Lose Yourself, The Real Slim Shady, Just Lose It, and others. The video starts out with a stereotypical redneck family watching television as they come across a show starring ""Marshall Mathers"" (Eminem's real name) as the video goes on Marshall parodies several TV shows and movies. He also imitates then President Bill Clinton, a porn star and others. The video was ranked #97 in NME's ""100 Greatest Music Videos"". Awards. Grammy Awards "
wikipedia-2271845," Buffy vs. Dracula  ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" is the fifth season premiere of the television series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Buffy faces the infamous Count Dracula, who has come to Sunnydale to make her one of his concubines. In the process, he turns Xander into a Renfield of sorts, and Giles becomes enthralled with the three sisters, much like Jonathan Harker in the novel. However, after a brief spell during which Buffy is mesmerized by the Count, she regains her usual composure and defeats him. Plot. Unable to sleep, Buffy goes out to patrol the cemetery and after staking a vampire, she returns to bed with Riley. The next day, Buffy and Riley play around at the beach, until Willow magically ignites the barbecue, and a sudden storm forces them all to seek shelter from the rain. Elsewhere, two men deliver a large crate to a residence, but when they drop it, a clawed hand breaks through the wood and attacks one of the men. Giles has Willow start scanning books into a computer so that they can be resources for the gang to use. He then tells her that he's going back to England because it seems he's no longer needed by Buffy or the Scoobies.  While patrolling, Buffy is confronted by a vampire who condenses from mist: he introduces himself as Count Dracula. When she tries to stake the legendary vampire, he disappears. Xander and Willow arrive to see Dracula before he turns into a bat and flies away. The women discuss how amazing Dracula is, and Riley and Xander both express their jealousy towards the infamous Dark Prince. Willow makes a lame attempt to attract attention to Giles and his usefulness, but the gang seems oblivious. As Xander is walking home alone, he encounters Dracula. Using his mysterious charms, the vampire persuades Xander to be his aide and lure the Slayer to him. Riley asks Spike about Dracula, but the former commando is warned that Dracula is too dangerous for him to take on alone. Buffy awakens to find Dracula in her bedroom. She is helpless against his powers and unable to stop him from biting her. When she wakes the next morning, she hides the puncture marks in her neck with a scarf. Later, the gang discusses their plan of attack. Buffy seems distracted and after hearing about the truths of Dracula, she leaves abruptly. Riley follows her and forces her to take off the scarf to show the puncture marks on her neck. Everyone is shocked to see that she has been under the control of Dracula. Since Xander is under Dracula's power, he has a strange hunger for spiders and attempts to defend the powerful vampire to his friends. Xander volunteers to have Buffy stay safely at his place, Willow and Tara use magic to protect the Summers's home, and Giles and Riley go after Dracula. Anya complains about not going after Dracula herself, until Xander locks her in the closet. Xander takes the willing Slayer to his ""Master"" in hopes of getting immortality in return. After being left alone with Dracula, Buffy tries to take control and stake him, but he is easily able to make her put the stake down. Riley and Giles discover Dracula's castle, remarking how they've never noticed it before, and enter carefully. Dracula talks to Buffy of all the things he will do for her while she struggles to regain control of herself. Xander tries to stop Riley from going after Dracula, but Riley knocks him out with one punch. Giles finds himself victim to the Three Sisters who effectively keep him distracted. Dracula offers his blood to Buffy, and she hesitantly takes a drink. A flash of memories allows Buffy to break his control over her. Riley rescues Giles from the sister vampires, and they go to save Buffy. Buffy and Dracula fight in a vicious battle, and finally Buffy stakes him. After they leave, Dracula comes back from the dust. Buffy is there and stakes him again, knowing he would come back. Dracula attempts to re-form again but is reminded by Buffy that she is ""standing right here"". He slips away in his mist-form. Buffy talks to Giles, telling him that she wants to be the Slayer again, to learn about her duties and her future. She asks Giles to be her Watcher again, and Giles is pleased. Buffy comes home and announces to her mom that she's going out with Riley. As she enters her room, she finds a girl there going through her stuff. Joyce tells Buffy that she should take her sister with her if she goes out, to which both girls immediately complain, ""Mom!"" Arc significance. Buffy's sister Dawn is introduced. Her arrival was foreshadowed in cryptic dream scenes in both the Season Three finale ""Graduation Day Part 2"" and the Season Four episode ""This Year's Girl"", in which a still-comatose Faith says, ""Little sis coming, I know."" Buffy replies, ""So much to do before she gets here"" (the first appearance of Dawn is in Buffy's room). In the season four finale, ""Restless"", Tara warns Buffy to ""be back before Dawn."" Dawn's arrival by creating an alternate reality occurs during the events of this episode, as Buffy's mother remarks that her house gets very quiet without Buffy present when Buffy announces she has to leave to go on patrol, indicating Dawn does not yet exist. Production. The vampire who was going to show Buffy a darker side of herself was originally envisioned as ""just another vampire who rode a horse and was all cool"", says writer Marti Noxon. ""I kept saying, 'Like Dracula - until Joss Whedon said, ""Why not Dracula? He's public domain."" Noxon says the scene in which Dracula implies that Buffy would ""make an amazing vampire"" thematically resonates with the questions of identity with which Buffy struggles throughout Season 5. When questioning Dracula's identity, Buffy mentions having encountered ""pimply and overweight"" vampires who named themselves after Anne Rice's vampire character Lestat de Lioncourt. This is the first indication that some vampires appreciate Rice's perspective on vampirism; in contrast, ""School Hard"" and ""Darla"" depicted some vampires as having contempt for Rice's concepts. "
wikipedia-2271864," National Chung Cheng University  National Chung Cheng University (), abbreviated CCU, is a public research university located in Minxiong, Chiayi County, Taiwan. It is distinctive among universities in Taiwan in that it is dedicated to the core humanities and the basic sciences, both natural and social. In both quality and quantity of research it annually places among the top 5% of universities in Taiwan (see reference section). Chung Cheng is among the four universities of the Taiwan Comprehensive University System. History. National Chung Cheng University was the first public university established after Taiwan's economic boom of the 1980s. In 1986, in order to promote research and to develop higher education in the Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan areas, the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan) approved a plan to establish a strongly research-oriented university in Chiayi. It was named after Chiang Kai-Shek (Wade-Giles: Chiang Chung-cheng), and was officially founded on July 1, 1989. Lin Ching-Jiang (林清江) served as its first president.  Lin established the original five colleges: namely, the College of Humanities, the College of Sciences, the College of Social Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the College of Management. He stepped down in 1996, and was succeeded by Guo-Shuen Jeng (鄭國順, 1997–2001), who in turn was succeeded by Ren C. Luo (羅仁權, 2001–2008). , a professor of mathematics, is the current president. One among Wu's most significant accomplishments as a scholar is the Grove-Petersen-Wu Finiteness Theorem. Academics. Profile. National Chung Cheng University is alone among Taiwan universities in devoting itself primarily to the most basic fields of scholarship: physics, chemistry, biology, economics, mathematics, philosophy, history, and literature. In Taiwan, only National Chung Cheng University and National Taiwan University are able to offer a complete, traditional liberal arts curriculum, a curriculum similar in spirit to that of the University of Chicago's ""Common Core"".  One of the distinctive aspects of National Chung Cheng University's liberal arts program is that it is the only university in Asia that provides a complete course of study in Analytic Philosophy. Philosophy of this type predominates among most of the highly ranked universities in North America, Great Britain, and Australia. This philosophical approach establishes strong links with the other core fields of scholarship, including the empirical sciences, mathematics, law, and linguistics.  CCU is the first in Taiwan to establish a TEAL (technology enabled active learning) classroom. It is modeled after the design used at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In construction of a multi-media facility, through its personal response system, and by installation of the software program, TEAL not only helps to increase class attendance, it also promotes student engagement with the class content. Collaboration with universities in Taiwan. Recently, the university has forged a Taiwan T4 Alliance with the three other main research-intensive universities in central and southern Taiwan--National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, and National Chung Hsing University. Purposes of this alliance include: pooling of educational resources, promotion of collaborative research with local industries, and the fostering of inter-university research projects.  International Collaboration. CCU is also involved in multiple forms of international collaboration. For example, the College of Engineering is now working with the German gear manufacturer, Klingelnberg GmbH, to develop a quality analysis software for bevel gear. And, included among its partner universities are: University of Pittsburgh (USA), Indiana University (Bloomington) (USA), UCLA (USA), Tohoku University (Japan), and Korea University (Korea).  Rankings. Although it is only 20 years old, among the more than 160 universities in Taiwan, its research performance is annually ranked among the top 5%. To illustrate this point, note that the National Science Council of Taiwan, when evaluating research project applications, rated Chung Cheng University as number 8, nation-wide, for the four-year period from 2003–2007. In the 2010 Times Higher Education QS Asian rankings, the university advanced 30 places relative to its 2009 ranking.  Within Taiwan, National Chung Cheng University has pioneered research into and the pedagogy of such diverse disciplines as opto-mechatronics and chemical engineering, criminology, and seismology. The university also has highly ranked Colleges of Law, Management, and Engineering. In 2010, the Computer Science Program was ranked number eight and the Electrical Engineering Program was ranked number nine, nation-wide, by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan. Moreover, the university library is well suited for research: when ranked for both the provision of services and total resources (collections, personnel, expenditures, and buildings) it is among the top four in Taiwan.  CCU has been ranked as the best school in Taiwan at protecting student rights. Results of a survey conducted by the 1111 Human Resources Institute, published in July 2010, indicate that the university has advanced seven places (from 16th to 9th), when comparing on-the-job performance of recent graduates. Accreditation Spring 2010. In the Spring of 2010, all departments were formally accredited by the ""Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan"" (aka HEEACT). HEEACT began the process of systematically reviewing university departments and institutes in the Spring of 2007. Campus. The Setting. The university is located in north-central Chiayi County, one of Taiwan's main agricultural areas. It is fifteen kilometers (or approximately ten miles) away from the city of Chiayi, and just a bit farther from the Taiwan High Speed Rail Station that is located in Taibao. The campus sits atop a hill overlooking the township of Min-Hsiung, which is home to the ""Chiayi Performing Arts Center"". The university is within convenient driving distance of many other attractions as well: to the east is the Alishan National Scenic Area of Chiayi, one of the most beautiful mountain districts in the world; to the west are various coastal towns along the Taiwan Strait, such as Budai, Chiayi, which is famous for its fish market; and, to the northwest, on the border with Yunlin County, is the township of Beigang, home to the oldest Mazu Temple in Taiwan, Chaotian Temple. Annually, on Mazu's birthday, which is the 23rd day of the 3rd lunar month (as early as mid-April or as late as early May), pilgrims flock to Beigang by the thousands to participate in the spectacular festival.  The Campus Itself. The campus itself is one of the most beautiful in Taiwan, noted both for its greenery and its distinctive architecture. Among the many species of tree are the Bengal almond, the cotton tree, the Spanish flag, and the silk floss. Among the more striking edifices is the pyramid-shaped Administration Building, which is located at the campus center. No less impressive is the eight-story Library and Information Building, that has been rated as one of the five best university libraries in Taiwan. It was designed by the eminent architect Chiu-Hwa Wang (王秋華). Adjacent to the library is the gymnasium, which includes a fitness center, an indoor olympic-size pool, and an outdoor pool. It is one of the best sports complexes in Taiwan. Near the entrance to the university is the Student Activity Center, which borders Tranquility Lake, a lake populated by a gaggle of black swans. This area has become a popular scenic spot for visitors and residents of the nearby community. Student organisations. Students' Association. The National Chung Cheng University Student Association (CCUSA) consists of Executive Center, the Student Council, the Advisory Committee. The President of CCUSA represents the students in Chung Cheng University and the outside world. The Secretary-General is the head of the Secretariat of the CCUSA, acting as the spokesperson and leader of the Executive Center. The Student Council, acting as an administrative supervision division, represents students from departments. The association is affiliated to the Taiwan T4 Alliance Student Association. Media. Chung Cheng E Newspapers: 2008 foreign student scandal. In 2008, the university's political science department received media attention for its treatment of an American doctoral student, William Terry Alred. Alred had stated in his application that he could not speak or understand Chinese, and was accepted into the program. Conflict occurred when one of his professors (whose course was required) refused to teach him in English, and according to Alred's account, manuevered to have him expelled through subterfuge. Academic affairs dean Huang Buo-nung admitted that ""Perhaps the department accepted students too quickly,"" explaining that the school could not force its professors to teach in English. Alred ultimately quit the program. The university responded by offering free Chinese classes to its foreign students, and by funding limited English-medium instruction.  General References.

wikipedia-2271872," Broken plural  In linguistics, a broken plural (or internal plural) is an irregular plural form of a noun or adjective found in the Semitic languages and other Afroasiatic languages such as Berber. Broken plurals are formed by changing the pattern of consonants and vowels inside the singular form. They contrast with sound plurals (or external plurals), which are formed by adding a suffix. It is distinct from Germanic umlaut, a form of vowel mutation found in Germanic languages. While the phenomenon is known from several Semitic languages, nowhere has it become as productive as in Arabic. Arabic. In Arabic, the regular way of making a plural for a masculine noun is adding the suffix ""-ūn"" (for the nominative) or ""-īn"" (for the accusative and genitive) at the end. For feminine nouns, the regular way is to add the suffix ""-āt"". However, not all plurals follow these simple rules. One class of nouns in both spoken and written Arabic produce plurals by changing the pattern of vowels inside the word, sometimes also with the addition of a prefix or suffix. This system is not fully regular, and it is used mainly for masculine non-human nouns. Human nouns are pluralized regularly or irregularly. Broken plurals are known as ""jam‘ taksīr"" (جَمع تَكسير, literally ""plural of breaking"") in Arabic grammar. These plurals constitute one of the most unusual aspects of the language, given the very strong and highly detailed grammar and derivation rules that govern the written language. Broken plurals can also be found in languages that have borrowed many words from Arabic, for instance Persian, Pashto, Turkish, Kurdish, Azerbaijani and Urdu, and sometimes exist in both a broken plural Arabic form and a local, adapted plural, e.g. in Pashto where the word for purpose (مطلب) can be pluralised in either its Arabic form مطالب for more formal, High Pashto, or the according to Pashto rules of plural as مطلبونه in everyday speech. In Persian this kind of plural is called ""jameh mokassar"" (جَمِع مُکَسَر, literally ""broken plural""). Full knowledge of these plurals can come only with extended exposure to the language, though a few rules can be noted. Example. Semitic languages typically form triconsonantal roots, forming a ""grid"" into which vowels may be inserted without affecting the basic root. Here are a few examples; note that the commonality is in the root consonants (capitalized), not the vowels. Hebrew. In Hebrew, though all plurals must take either the sound masculine (""-im"" ים-) or feminine (""-ot"" ות-) plural suffixes, the historical stem alternations of the so-called segolate or consonant-cluster nouns between CVCC in the singular and CVCaC in the plural have often been compared to broken plural forms in other Semitic languages. Thus the form ""malkī"" מלכי ""my king"" in the singular is opposed to ""məlaxīm"" מלכים ""kings"" in the plural. In addition, there are many other cases where historical sound changes have resulted in stem allomorphy between singular and plural forms in Hebrew (or between absolute state and construct state, or between forms with pronominal suffixes and unsuffixed forms etc.), though such alternations do not operate according to general templates accommodating root consonants, and so are not usually considered to be true broken plurals by linguists. Ge'ez (Ethiopic). Broken plurals were used in some Ethiopic nouns. Examples include ""ˁanbässa"" 'lion' with ""ˁanabəst"" 'lions', ""kokäb"" 'star' with ""kwakəbt"" 'stars', ""ganen"" 'demon' with ""aganənt"" 'demons', and ""hagar"" 'region' with ""ˀahgur"" 'regions'. Some of these broken plurals are used in Amharic today, but generally seen as archaic. "
wikipedia-2271900," Nationality law  Nationality law is the branch of law concerned with the questions of nationality and citizenship, and how these statuses are acquired, transmitted, or lost. By custom, a state has the right to determine who its nationals and citizens are. Such determinations are usually made by custom, statutory law, or case law (precedent), or some combination. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by public international law—for example, by treaties on statelessness and the European Convention on Nationality. Principles. Broadly speaking, nationality law is based either on ""jus soli"" or ""jus sanguinis"", or on a combination of the two. ""Jus soli"" (Latin: the law of the soil) is the principle by which a child born within a country's territorial jurisdiction acquires that country's nationality. ""Jus sanguinis"" (Latin: the law of the blood) is the principle by which a child acquires the nationality of his or her parents. Today, most if not all countries apply a mixture of these two principles: neither granting citizenship to everyone born within the country's jurisdiction, nor denying citizenship to the children born abroad. International treaties. International law generally recognizes the right of states to set their own policy concerning nationality. Nevertheless, there are a number of international treaties that are relevant to nationality law. "
wikipedia-2271915," Fokker D.XXI  The Fokker D.XXI fighter was designed in 1935 for use by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (""Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger"", ML-KNIL) . As such, it was designed as a cheap and small, but rugged aircraft, which had respectable performance for its time. Entering operational use in the early years of World War II, it provided yeoman service for both the ""Luchtvaartafdeling"" (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force, and a few were built by the Carmoli factory before the factory fell into Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. Design and development. The Fokker D.XXI was a low-wing monoplane with a fixed spatted undercarriage. Following standard Fokker design practice of the period, it had a steel tube fuselage covered in large part by fabric, with wooden cantilever wings. Power was provided by a Bristol Mercury radial driving a three-blade two-pitch propeller. When it entered service in 1938 it was a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of aging biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive. Operational history. In 1936 a few Fokker D.XXIs were used by the Spanish Republic. Although the order by the ML-KNIL was cancelled, the ""Luchtvaartafdeling"" (Dutch Army Air Force before World War II) placed an order of 36 aircraft, which were all delivered in time to participate in the war against the Germans in May 1940. The Fokker D.XXI, although much slower and more lightly armed than the Bf 109, performed surprisingly well in dogfights, due to its maneuverability. It was also one of the few aircraft that could follow a ""Stuka"" bomber into its dive. Nonetheless, the numerical inferiority of the ""Luchtvaartafdeling"" compared to the ""Luftwaffe"" resulted in the destruction of most Dutch Fokker D.XXI fighters during the campaign. Some were captured during and after 15 May, but their fates, apart from their capture, are unknown. The Fokker D.XXI performed better and for much longer in the Finnish Air Force, which had acquired a number of licence-built fighters prior to the start of the Winter War. Against the aircraft of the Soviet Air Force, the Fokker was more evenly matched, and its rugged design with a radial engine and fixed undercarriage made it very suitable for Finnish conditions. Later in the war, as newer models of Soviet fighters appeared, the Fokker D.XXI was underpowered and too lightly armed (with only four 7.92 mm/.312 in machine guns) to compete. Plans to arm the Fokkers with 20 mm cannons were dropped and only one fighter was armed as such (two 20 mm cannons and two 7.92 mm/.312 in machine guns). Another fighter was equipped with retractable landing gear, but due to less than anticipated performance improvement, wasn't continued in the series. During the Continuation War (1941–44) the Finnish State Aircraft Factory (Valtion Lentokonetehdas, VL) also built some 50 D.XXIs with the Swedish-built Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior as the Bristol Mercury was in short supply. These can be identified by their longer cockpit glazing, smooth cowl, and large ventral air intake under the cowl. The fixed undercarriage lent itself to both unimproved runways and conversion to skis for winter use, both of which were advantages in the Finnish theater. Several Finnish Air Force pilots became fighter aces with the Fokker D.XXI. The top scoring Fokker ace was Jorma Sarvanto who obtained 12 5/6 victories with the type. Many other future aces scored at least one victory with the Fokker. The highest scoring airframe was FK-110, with 10 victories. This aircraft survived the war and is on display at the Central Finland Aviation Museum.

wikipedia-2271920," Headington  Headington is a suburb of Oxford, England. It is at the top of Headington Hill overlooking the city in the Thames Valley below. The life of the large residential area is centred upon London Road, the main road between London and Oxford. History. The site of Headington shows evidence of continued occupation from the Stone Age, as the 2001 field excavations in Barton Lane found, suggesting a date in the 11th century BC. Pottery was found on the Manor Ground, suggesting an Iron Age settlement there in the 7th century BC. Roman kilns from about AD 300 have been found, including one now on display at the Museum of Oxford. Anglo-Saxon burial remains from about AD 500 have also been discovered. Headington's toponym is derived from the Old English ""Hedena's dun"", meaning ""Hedena's hill"", when it was the site of a palace or hunting lodge of the Kings of Mercia. In a charter of 1004, Ethelred II of England, ""written at the royal ville called Headan dune"", gave land in Headington to Frideswide's priory, which included the quarry and the area around it. Henry I granted a chapel at Headington to the Augustinian canons regular of the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford when the priory was founded in 1122. The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew was built in the middle of the 12th century and enlarged in the 13th century. The bell tower was started in the 13th or 14th century and completed in about 1500. St. Andrew's was repaired in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Gothic Revival architect J.C. Buckler restored the building and lengthened the nave in 1862–1864.  Headington developed rapidly in the early 20th century, significant amounts of housing developed around the medieval village, now known as Old Headington. In 1927 it became an urban district separate from the Headington Rural District and in 1929 it was added to the city of Oxford. The other side of the London Rd is called New Headington.  Oxford United was originally Headington United F.C. Until 2001 its home ground was the Manor Ground, which had its main entrance on London Road. In 2001 Oxford United moved to the Kassam Stadium near Blackbird Leys. The Manor Ground has since been demolished and a private hospital built on the site. In 2002 a re-warding of the City created a ward called Headington representing both sides of the London Road, from Bury Knowle Park to Headley Way, with two elected representatives. The first councillors for this ward were David Rundle (2002–) and Stephen Tall (2002–2008). Ruth Wilkinson was elected to succeed Stephen Tall in May 2008. Headington today. Headington has a large and growing population. Headington's main employment sectors are medicine, education, and research. In the centre of Headington are a number of shops, pubs, cafés, restaurants, and other services. The area also includes the main campus of Oxford Brookes University, Ruskin College (which moved in its entirety from central Oxford to its Headington site in 2012), and the city's main hospitals, including the John Radcliffe, Nuffield and Churchill. Headington's most famous landmark is The Headington Shark, made by John Buckley for local broadcaster Bill Heine in 1986. Headington has a number of green spaces including Headington Hill and Bury Knowle parks. Close by is Shotover Hill, a heath and woodland area with views over Oxfordshire, and listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Warneford Meadow a wild grassland, bought in 1918 by public subscription for the adjacent Warneford Hospital has been registered as a Town Green and has thus escaped development. Sport and leisure. Headington has a non-league football team Headington Amateurs F.C. who play at the Barton Recreation Ground. Notable residents. J. R. R. Tolkien, author of ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", lived at 76 Sandfield Road in Headington from 1953 until 1968. C. S. Lewis, author of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", moved to the district in 1921 (he was born in Northern Ireland in 1898) and lived there until moving to The Kilns at nearby Risinghurst in 1930. He lived there until his death in 1963 at ""The Kilns"". Lewis is buried at Holy Trinity Church at Headington Quarry.  A more recent resident was John Simpson, senior editor of the ""Oxford English Dictionary"". A number of Oxford academics have decamped to Headington over the years, preferring it to North Oxford where most dons lived. They include Lord Krebs, David Marquand and Anthony Kenny. Sir Isaiah Berlin, the historian A. B. Emden, the chemist Dalziel Hammick, Lord Elton, Michael Ernest Sadler and John Johnson (the University Printer) were also among them. Others included music producer Adam Lee, the author Elizabeth Bowen, Robert Maxwell and Lord Nuffield (William Morris) and Anne Diamond, the TV presenter and author. Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer, lives in Old Headington. Emma Watson, Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter films, lives in Headington. She also attended Headington School. "

wikipedia-2271988," Christopher Dresser  Christopher Dresser (Glasgow, 4 July 1834 – Mulhouse, 24 November 1904) was a designer and design theorist, now widely known as one of the first and most important, independent, designers and was a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement, and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese or Modern English style; both originated in England and had long lasting international influence. Biography. Dresser was born in Glasgow, Scotland of a Yorkshire family. At age 13, he began attending the Government School of Design, Somerset House, London He received training in design and took botany as his specialization. He lectured on the new subject of Art Botany to complete his studies before his appointment in 1855 as Professor of Artistic Botany in the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington. He wrote a series of articles that appeared in the ""Art Journal"" in 1857, ""Botany as Adapted to the Arts and Art Manufactures."" In 1858 he sold his first designs. In 1850 the University of Jena, Germany where Schleiden held the chair, granted a conventional Doctorate to Dresser on his submission his books ""Rudiments of Botany ""1859 and"" Unity in Variety ""1859 and a short paper on plant structure; as Dresser did not attend the University his doctorate was awarded ""in absentia.""  From this early date his design work widened to include carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, and textiles printed and woven. He claimed to have designed 'as much as any man' at the International Exhibition London 1862. As early as 1865 the Building News reported that in the early part of his career he had been active as a designer of wallpapers, textiles and carpets thus the most active revolutioniser in the decorative art of the day. He wrote several books on design and ornament, including ""The Art of Decorative Design"" (1862), ""The Development of Ornamental Art in the International Exhibition"" (1862), and ""Principles of Design"" (1873) which was addressed in the Preface to 'working men'.In 1899 ""The Studio ""magazine found it was possible to quote this book 'page after page and not find a line, scarcely a word, that would not be endorsed by the most critical member of the Arts and Crafts Association today.' In effect Dresser set the agenda adopted by the Arts and Crafts movement at a later date.  In 1873 he was requested by the American Government to write a report on the design of household goods.  In four months in 1876/1877 Dresser travelled about 2000 miles in Japan, recording his impressions in ""Japan, its Architecture, Art and Art-Manufactures"". He represented the South Kensington Museum whilst in Japan, and was received at court by the Emperor, who ordered Dresser to be treated as a guest of the nation – all doors were open to him. He was requested by the Japanese Government to write a report on 'Trade with Europe'. His pioneering study of Japanese art is evident in much of his work which is considered typical of the Anglo-Japanese style. Between 1879 and 1882, as Art Superintendent at the Linthorpe Art Pottery in Linthorpe in Middlesbrough he designed over 1,000 pots. If his ceramic work from the 1860s onwards (for firms such as Mintons, Wedgwood, Royal Worcester, Watcombe, Linthorpe, Old Hall at Hanley and Ault) is considered, he must be amongst the most influential ceramic designers of any period. Much of his other work remains to be identified, although wallpaper designs for American, and textiles for French and German manufacturers have recently been located. Some of Dresser’s metalwork designs are still in production, such as his oil and vinegar sets and toast rack designs, now manufactured by Alessi and Alberto Alessi goes so far as to say Dresser 'knew the techniques of metal production better than any designer who has come to Alessi'. One of his Old Hall designs is thought to have inspired Alan Garner's 1967 novel ""The Owl Service"". Further reading. Durant, Stuart. Christopher Dresser. 1993 "

It is the only episode other than ""Once More, with Feeling"" and ""Two to Go"" where the title appears on screen. Plot synopsis. Several separate encounters take place around Sunnydale on one night, which is told in real time. Uniquely among ""Buffy"" episodes, none of the main characters interact with one another. According to the episode's staff writers, the primary emotion to be felt during this episode is ""being alone"" On patrol, Buffy discovers that her latest vampire foe is an old high school classmate named Holden Webster. Upon recognizing her, ""Webs"" stops their fight and takes on a friendly demeanor – seeming pleasantly surprised to have run into her and asking how she has been. Because she doesn't immediately remember him, Webs begins to jog her memory about the half dozen times they interacted with each other. Buffy finally recalls him, and the two begin to reminisce. The vampire, a psychology major in life, proceeds to psychoanalyze Buffy, and she opens up to him about her innermost conflicts and problems while at the same time fighting. She slays him in the end, but not before he identifies Spike as the vampire who (recently) sired him. Back at Revello Drive, Dawn prepares for a night alone at home. An unnaturally loud banging sets her nerves on edge. She talks with her friend Kit on the phone, asking, ""See? Do you hear that?"" when the banging begins again. Eventually, Dawn comes to believe that her mother is trying to contact her, and the malevolent force is working to prevent her. Dawn manages to exorcise the malevolent force and Joyce appears to warn her that when the time comes, Buffy won't choose her. In a story entirely devoid of dialogue, Spike picks up a woman at a bar, walks her home, and feeds on her, leaving her dead on her own doorstep. Jonathan and Andrew return from Mexico to dig up an artifact hidden near the Hellmouth. Andrew is secretly in contact with what appears to be the ghost of Warren, while Jonathan is having a personal revelation that he misses high school and still cares for his old friends. After they dig up the artifact, Andrew, on Warren's instructions, insults and kills Jonathan, causing his blood to spill all over a 'door' in the dirt. In the library, Willow is visited by the ghost of Cassie, a girl Buffy once helped, who claims to have been sent by the dead Tara. The ghost relays Tara's message that Willow will end up killing everyone if she ever uses magic again, and recommends suicide as a solution. This tips Willow off that she has not been talking to Cassie, and she demands to know who the being really is. The being reveals itself as The First and threatens Willow and all her friends before vanishing. "
wikipedia-2272047," American Birth Control League  The American Birth Control League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921 at the First American Birth Control Conference in New York City. The League was incorporated under the laws of New York State on April 5, 1922. Its headquarters were located at 104 Fifth Avenue, New York City from 1921–30 and at various offices on Madison Avenue from 1931–39. It was not associated with the National Birth Control League, founded in 1915 by Mary Coffin Ware Dennett, or the later Voluntary Parenthood League. The organization promoted the founding of birth control clinics, primarily for the Black and Latino population, and encouraged women to control their own fertility. History. Birth Control Leagues had already been formed in a number of larger American cities between 1916 and 1919 due to Sanger's lecture tours and the publication of the Birth Control Review. By 1924, the American Birth Control League had 27,500 members, with ten branches maintained in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colorado, and British Columbia. In June 1928, Margaret Higgins Sanger resigned as president of the American Birth Control League, founding the National Committee for Federal Legislation on Birth Control and splitting the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau from the League. In 1939 the two were reconciled and merged to form the Birth Control Federation of America. In 1942 the name was changed to Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Goals and activities. The ABCL was founded on the following principles, here excerpted from Margaret Sanger's ""The Pivot of Civilization"": We hold that children should be Therefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to prevent conception except when these conditions can be satisfied. At its founding, the ABCL announced the following purposes: Margaret Sanger listed the following aims of the organization in the appendix of her book ""The Pivot of Civilization"": In 1921, the ABCL organized the First American Birth Control Conference at New York City, November 11–18, 1921. Subsequent conferences were held over the next two years in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Albany, and Chicago. The ABCL arranged the holding of the Sixth International Birth Control Congress in the United States in 1925. The ABCL published leaflets, pamphlets, books, and a monthly missal named ""Birth Control Review"". Margaret Sanger served as the first president of the organization. The vice-presidents were Charlotte Delafield and Juliet Barrett Rublee. Frances B. Ackerman served as the first Treasurer. Anne Kennedy was the Executive Treasurer. Lothrop Stoddard and C. C. Little were among the founding directors. Other presidents of the ABCL were: Eleanor Dwight Jones (1928–34), Catherine Clement Bangs (1934–36) and C. C. Little (1936–39). "
wikipedia-2272099," British New Wave  The British New Wave is the name given to a trend in filmmaking among directors in Britain in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The label is a translation of ""Nouvelle Vague"", the French term first applied to the films of François Truffaut, and Jean-Luc Godard among others. There is considerable overlap between the New Wave and the so-called ""Angry Young Men"", those artistes in British theatre and film such as playwright John Osborne and director Tony Richardson, who challenged the social ""status quo"". Their work drew attention to the reality of life for the working classes, especially in the North of England, often characterized as ""It's grim up north"". This particular type of drama, centred around class and the nitty-gritty of day-to-day life, was also known as the kitchen sink drama. Stylistic characteristics. The British New Wave was characterised by many of the same stylistic and thematic conventions as the French New Wave. Usually in black-and-white, these films had a spontaneous quality, often shot in a pseudo-documentary (or ""cinéma vérité"") style on real locations and with real people rather than extras, apparently capturing life as it happens. Influence of writers and short film makers. Like the French New Wave, where many of the filmmakers began as film critics and journalists, in Britain critical writing about the state of British cinema began in the 1950s and foreshadowed some of what was to come. Among this group of critic/documentary film makers was Lindsay Anderson who was a prominent critic writing for the influential ""Sequence"" magazine (1947–52), which he co-founded with Gavin Lambert and Karel Reisz (later a prominent director); writing for the British Film Institute's journal ""Sight and Sound"" and the left-wing political weekly the ""New Statesman"". In one of his early and most well-known polemical pieces, ""Stand Up, Stand Up"", he outlined his theories of what British cinema should become. Following a series of screenings which he organised at the National Film Theatre of independently produced short films including his own ""Every Day Except Christmas"" (about the Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market), Karel Reisz's ""Momma Don't Allow"" and others, he developed a philosophy of cinema which found expression in what became known as the Free Cinema Movement in Britain by the late 1950s. This was the belief that the cinema must break away from its class-bound attitudes and that the working classes ought to be seen on Britain's screens.  Along with Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson, and others he secured funding from a variety of sources (including Ford of Britain) and they each made a series of socially challenging short documentaries on a variety of subjects. These films, made in the tradition of British documentaries in the 1930s by such men as John Grierson, foreshadowed much of the social realism of British cinema which emerged in the 1960s with Anderson's own film ""This Sporting Life"", Reisz's ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", and Richardson's ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"".  By 1964, the cycle was essentially over. Tony Richardson's ""Tom Jones"", Richard Lester's ""A Hard Day's Night"" and the early James Bond films ushered in a new era for British cinema, focusing less on realism and social issues, and more on light comedy and escapism.  And yet Lindsay Anderson continued his theme of anti-establishment anti-heroes in 1968 with ""If..."" (1968), which starred Malcolm McDowell in the role that made Stanley Kubrick cast him for A Clockwork Orange. "
wikipedia-2272102," Protoplanetary nebula  A protoplanetary nebula or preplanetary nebula (PPN) is an astronomical object which is at the short-lived episode during a star's rapid stellar evolution between the late asymptotic giant branch (LAGB) phase and the subsequent planetary nebula (PN) phase. A PPN emits strongly in infrared radiation, and is a kind of reflection nebula. It is the second-from-the-last high-luminosity evolution phase in the life cycle of intermediate-mass stars (1–8 M☉).  Naming. The name protoplanetary nebula is an unfortunate choice due to the possibility of confusion with the same term being sometimes employed when discussing the unrelated concept of protoplanetary disks. The name protoplanetary nebula is a consequence of the older term planetary nebula, which was chosen due to early astronomers looking through telescopes and finding a similarity in appearance of planetary nebula to the gas giants such as Neptune and Uranus. To avoid any possible confusion, suggests employing a new term preplanetary nebula which does not overlap with any other disciplines of astronomy. They are often referred to as post-AGB stars, although that category also includes stars that will never ionize their ejected matter. Evolution. Beginning. During the LAGB phase, when mass loss reduces the hydrogen envelope's mass to around 10−2 ""M""☉ for a core mass of 0.60 ""M""☉, a star will begin to evolve towards the blue side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. When the hydrogen envelope has been further reduced to around 10−3 ""M""☉, the envelope will have been so disrupted that it is believed further significant mass loss is not possible. At this point, the effective temperature of the star, ""T""*, will be around 5,000 K and it is defined to be the end of the LAGB and the beginning of the PPN.  Protoplanetary nebula phase. During the ensuing protoplanetary nebula phase, the central star's (CS) effective temperature will continue rising as a result of the envelope's mass loss as a consequence of the hydrogen shell's burning. During this phase, the CS is still too cool to ionize the slow-moving circumstellar shell ejected during the preceding AGB phase. However, the CS does appear to drive high-velocity, collimated winds which shape and shock this shell, and almost certainly entrain slow-moving AGB ejecta to produce a fast molecular wind. Observations and high-resolution imaging studies from 1998 to 2001, demonstrate that the rapidly evolving PPN phase ultimately shapes the morphology of the subsequent PN. At a point during or soon after the AGB envelope detachment, the envelope shape changes from roughly spherically symmetric to axially symmetric. The resultant morphologies are bipolar, knotty jets and Herbig-Haro-like “bow shocks”. These shapes appear even in relatively “young” PPN.  End. The PPN phase continues until the central star reaches around 30,000 K and it is hot enough (producing enough ultraviolet radiation) to ionize the circumstellar nebula (ejected gases) and it becomes a kind of emission nebula called a PN. This transition must take place in less than around 10,000 years or else the density of the circumstellar envelope will fall below the PN formulation density threshold of around 100 per cm³ and no PN will result, such a case is sometimes referred to as a 'lazy planetary nebula'.  Recent conjectures. In 2001, Bujarrabal et al. found that the “interacting stellar winds” model of Kwok et al. (1978) of radiatively-driven winds is insufficient to account for their CO observations of PPN fast winds which imply high momentum and energy inconsistent with that model. This has prompted theorists (Soker & Rappaport 2000; Frank & Blackmann 2004) to investigate whether an accretion disk scenario, similar to the model used to explain jets from active galactic nuclei and young stars, could account for both the point symmetry and the high degree of collimation seen in many PPN jets. In such a model, the accretion disk forms through binary interactions. Magneto-centrifugal launching from the disk surface is then a way to convert gravitational energy into the kinetic energy of a fast wind. If this model is correct and magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) do determine the energetics and collimation of PPN outflows, then they will also determine physics of the shocks in these flows, and this can be confirmed with high-resolution pictures of the emission regions that go with the shocks.

Paredes began acting in 1960 film, ""091 Policia al Habla"" (""091, Police Speaking!"") She became a teen idol across Spain after that movie. In 1975, she and Raphael collaborated in a cartoon film about Raphael, titled ""Rafael en Rapahel"". Paredes has participated in 73 films and television series. Paredes has appeared only occasionally on Spanish television, usually as herself on some ""culebron"" chapter (""culebron"" is a Spanish slang word for ""telenovela"", or ""soap opera""). Paredes has also participated in 25 award shows in Spain. She portrayed the leading role of La Peregrina in a television production of Alejandro Casona's ""La dama del alba"". She has appeared in several acclaimed films, including ""Tras el cristal"" (1986) by Agustí Villaronga, ""Dark Habits"" (1983), ""High Heels"" (1991), ""The Flower of My Secret"" (1995), ""All About My Mother"" (1999) and ""The Skin I Live In"" (2011) (all by Pedro Almodóvar), and Roberto Benigni's ""Life Is Beautiful"" (1998). In 1996, she was given the National Film Award by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. In 2007, she appeared in the short movie, ""El camino de Ana"". From 2000 to 2003 she was the president of the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España. "
wikipedia-2272112," Virge  A virge, from the Latin virga, is a type of rod, made of wood. Originally it was one or more branches (the French often use ""verges"", the plural of its equivalent, as the normal word for a rod, the rarer singular ""verge"" rather indicates a switch) used as an instrument for corporal punishment, or as a riding crop. It is presently best known as the ceremonial staff of the Anglican and Episcopalian lay church officers known as verger (or originally ""virger"" : the title derives from virge), who originally used it as a 'weapon' to make way for the ecclesiastical procession (compare the catholic garde suisse), and occasionally to chastise unruly choristers.

wikipedia-2272118," Counter-proliferation  Counter-proliferation refers to diplomatic, intelligence, and military efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons, including both weapons of mass destruction (WMD), long-range missiles, and certain conventional weapons. Nonproliferation and arms control are related terms. In contrast to nonproliferation, which focuses on diplomatic, legal and administrative measures to dissuade and impede the acquisition of such weapons, counter-proliferation focuses on intelligence, law enforcement, and sometimes military action to prevent their acquisition. Weapons of mass destruction. Chemical. Industrial accidents, such as the Bhopal disaster, Halifax Explosion, Texas City Disaster, and Oppau explosion have caused mass casualties. Weapons delivery. Missile technology. Long-range missile technology is of greatest threat when the missiles carry weapons of mass destruction, but long-range weapons with precision guidance can be serious threats with explosive or other conventional warheads. This has been supplemented by the International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC), also known as the Hague Code of Conduct. Technical means of verification, including space-based sensors that can scan large parts of the world, can provide early warning of long-range missile development. Space-based Staring Infrared Sensors can detect the heat of rocket launching motors. Various radars can monitor range and other characteristics, but they need to be in a place where they have line-of-sight to the missile trajectory. The United States, probably Russia, and possibly other nations have aircraft-based and ship-based sensors that can monitor such tests, but there has to be warning of potential tests so these sensors can be deployed.

wikipedia-2272171," Lies My Parents Told Me  ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" is the 17th episode in season seven of the television show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". It was originally intended to air on March 18, 2003, a day before the ""Angel"" episode ""Orpheus"", but was postponed due to the eruption of the Iraq War. The gang investigates Spike's trigger; Principal Wood and Giles team up without Buffy. Plot synopsis. New York, 1977: Spike is fighting Nikki Wood, a Slayer whom he kills, seen in the fifth season episode ""Fool for Love"", in a park at night in pouring rain while her son watches from his hiding place behind a bench. Spike has the opportunity to kill her but the kid distracts him and he lets her go with the promise that they'll meet again. ""Love the coat,"" he adds with a smile, before he leaves. When he's gone, a clearly troubled Nikki finds her son and calms his fears by telling him, ""The mission is what matters."" The scene switches to an alley in present-day Sunnydale. Buffy, Principal Robin Wood, and Spike are fighting a bunch of vampires. Buffy and Spike manage to kill their quarry, but a vampire has knocked Wood to the ground, and is about to kill him. Spike saves Wood by killing the vampire from behind, then helps him up. Wood thanks him, but the camera zooms in on the stake he's holding. Wood crushes the spike in his fist, causing his hand to bleed.  Previously, the First Evil had programmed Spike with a post-hypnotic suggestion in his mind that allows it to turn Spike violent using an old song, ""Early One Morning"", as a trigger. This way the First was able to command him to kill again. Buffy wants to find out how to turn it off so that she can fully trust Spike against the First, but Giles opposes Buffy. In his opinion, Spike is dangerous and must be contained or disposed of. At the same time, the Scoobies go to the basement of Buffy's house, where Willow makes a spell with the Prokaryote stone, a magical artifact that penetrates Spike's mind and makes him more conscious of how the trigger works. During this process information about Spike's human past is revealed, including how he turned his sick mother into a vampire only to be rejected by her newly vampiric self. The song that his mother used to sing makes him relive the whole episode and switch into his evil, soulless self. He unwittingly hurts Dawn in the process and scares them all, except Buffy. Meanwhile, Willow receives a phone call from a girl named Fred and quickly leaves for Los Angeles. She apologizes to Buffy for her quick departure, but promises to be back as soon as she can. After the previous incident, Wood privately convinces Giles that Spike must die. Giles learns that Wood is the son of Nikki, now dead, and that Spike murdered her. The two plan for Giles to distract Buffy while Wood takes care of Spike.  Giles takes Buffy on patrol and begins asking her indirect questions and making obscure references to her role against the First. In the meantime, Wood takes Spike to his hideout with the promise to protect him, but upon arrival Wood reveals to Spike that he knows Spike murdered his mother and that he's going to kill the monster inside him. Spike says he has no remorse over killing Wood's mother, and that it was ""all part of the game"". Wood then plays the song ""Early One Morning"", which triggers Spike's violent, monstrous self and the two fight. As the fight progresses, Spike continues to relive the events that transpired between him and his mother, due to the Prokaryote Stone. Wood takes advantage of Spike's flashbacks, and using weapons, knocks Spike around until he cannot stand and he then attempts to stake him. Spike regains control of his own mind, having faced his own anger and regret on turning his mother into a vampire and then being forced to kill her. Spike defeats Wood and demonstrates that the song has no more power over him, and tells Wood that the difference between his mother and Spike's mother, is that Spike's mother actually loved him back.  While Giles and Buffy are talking in the cemetery, they become involved in a fight with another vampire. Buffy realizes that Giles has been trying to distract her while Wood kills Spike. She kills the vampire, leaves Giles and rushes to Wood's place. Buffy finds Spike at Wood's place, with Wood badly beaten, but alive. Spike tells her that he spared Wood because of what he did to his mother, but if he tries anything again, he'll kill him. Buffy goes inside and tells Wood that she needs Spike alive, and that she has no time for personal vendettas. She promises him that if he tries anything like this again, she'll let Spike kill him. As she walks away, she says she has a mission to win this war - ""The mission is what matters"" - echoing Robin's mother's words when he was a child. Once at home, Buffy tells Giles that his and Wood's plan failed, and shuts the door on him, saying ""I think you've taught me everything I need to know."" "
wikipedia-2272260," Two to Go  ""Two to Go"" is the 21st episode of season 6 of the television show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". The name of the episode is a reference to the previous one, which ends with Willow saying ""One down"" after killing Warren. Despite the death of Tara Maclay, she remains in brief scenes that are part of the opening credits. This episode, and its second part, ""Grave"", were shown, back-to-back, as a two-hour feature on its original airing in both the USA and UK – consequently, the presentation of this episode on DVD includes credits such as """"Grave"" Written by""... Joss Whedon uses a credit technique after the final scene. He doesn't put Anthony Stewart Head's name in the opening credits at all, and instead appear at the end as a ""Special Guest Star"", so as to keep the character's appearance a surprise. Whedon also does this in ""Angel"" for Julie Benz in ""To Shanshu in L.A."", Eliza Dushku in ""Judgment"", Juliet Landau in ""The Trial"" and Alyson Hannigan in ""There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb"". Plot. Buffy, Xander, and Anya try to pursue Willow, who has killed Warren to avenge his murder of Tara and now plans to execute his two jailed accomplices. They discover that Willow has damaged Xander's car to prevent them from catching her. Buffy continues her pursuit on foot. Anya teleports into Jonathan and Andrew's cell shortly before Willow arrives. Anya and Buffy manage to evade Willow's attack and slip away with the two men. As Xander drives them away in a stolen police cruiser, Willow attacks them with a truck she is wielding magically; but her overuse of magic has drained her power, and they escape. In a cave in Africa, Spike continues to pass stages in his ordeal. Dawn and Clem decide to go to the dark magician Rack's lair, expecting Willow to try to deal with him to recharge her powers. Buffy, Xander and Anya regroup at the Magic Box and debate their course of action. Buffy believes she can convince Willow to relent, but the others disagree; Buffy heads for Rack's, alone. Xander admits to Anya that he might have been able to stop Warren before he fired on Buffy and Tara, but was afraid to intervene, unarmed. Willow meets with Rack, who attempts to seduce her. She rejects his advances, seizes him, drains his power, and kills him, just as Dawn arrives. Dawn's effort to calm the much more powerful Willow prove futile and serve only to annoy her, but Buffy arrives before she acts against Dawn. Buffy tries to talk with Willow, who replies that nothing in the world matters anymore since Tara's death. Willow teleports the group back to the Magic Shop, where Buffy and Dawn collapse. As Willow attacks, Anya fires up a protection spell to shield Jonathan and Andrew. As Willow intensifies her attack, Buffy tries a physical attack, allowing all but Anya to escape.  Willow subdues Buffy, then disables Anya and negates her protection spells. As she declares her victory, she is struck down by a bolt of energy from the just-arrived Rupert Giles. "
wikipedia-2272283," Dirty Girls  ""Dirty Girls"" is the 18th episode of season 7 of the television series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Plot synopsis. A young Potential, Shannon, is chased through the woods by Bringers. She accepts the assistance of a stranger wearing a priest's collar and driving a truck and is horrified to discover that she has fallen into a trap. The man, who introduces himself as Caleb, terrifies her and burns his mark into her neck. He gives her a message for the Slayer (which the viewer does not hear at this time), stabs her in the stomach, and forces her out of the car. Minutes later, Faith and Willow find the girl on their way back to Sunnydale after re-ensouling Angel in Los Angeles and take her to the hospital.  At his apartment, Xander's erotic dream about the teenage Potentials is cut short when the girls wake him up to fix the toilet.  At the hospital, Faith asks Willow why the Scooby Gang failed to warn her about the threat of the Bringers. Faith subsequently encounters Spike chasing a young woman and mistakenly believes Spike is evil again. The young woman, now in her vampire form, attacks Faith, who (borrowing a stake from Buffy) quickly slays her.  Back at the house, Faith encounters a cold reception from both Dawn and Giles, and Spike explains that the tension is not all because of her. Meanwhile, the First Evil reveals Buffy's form to Caleb who is residing in the basement of a winery. The next day, Andrew tries to bring the interested Potentials up to speed on Faith's history. While they are quick to point out that Faith had killed a volcanologist, not a Vulcan, they watch Faith exercise in the back yard with fascination over this other Slayer.  At Sunnydale High School, Robin calls Buffy into his office where he fires her from her school job, emphasizing the need for her to focus on the mission.  In the Summers' home, Faith sneaks down into the basement to smoke a cigarette and have a moment away from the ""wanna-bes"" who, in her opinion, have way too much energy and are needy for more stories from her about her life. Spike sees her and also asks for a cigarette. She and Spike talk, and bond over their respective periods of being dangerous. Faith reveals they met once before years ago when Faith was in Buffy's body, and Spike reveals that he and Buffy had been more than just friends at one point. Buffy, having been fired by Principal Wood so she can focus more on the mission at hand, comes down and seems a bit unnerved at seeing the two of them so cozy. Dawn calls down that Willow has reported from the hospital: Shannon is awake. Buffy goes to the hospital, where Shannon tells Buffy of Caleb's message: he has something of Buffy's.  Later at the house, Buffy tries to motivate the terrified Potentials to accompany her when she attacks Caleb (who, meanwhile, is re-enacting scenes of his past murders with the First Evil). Buffy alone is confident in her plan; Giles, Spike, her friends, and the Potentials all question her decision. Buffy and Faith, on a recon mission, follow a Bringer through the woods. They discuss Faith's intentions and her recent experiences with Angel before locating Caleb's stronghold in an old winery. At the Summers' home, Xander directs the Potentials on the methods of attacking in battle. When Rona criticizes Buffy's intentions, Xander strongly defends his friend. Leaving Willow and Giles to stay behind to protect the more inexperienced girls, Buffy leads Spike, Faith, Xander, and the more experienced Potentials (including Kennedy, Molly, Rona, Chao-Ahn, Amanda, Diane, and several others) to the vineyard; they divide into two groups: an assault team and a back-up team. After an initial clash with the Bringers, Caleb appears. He has super-strength: he quickly knocks aside Buffy and Spike, and breaks Rona's arm. Xander and Faith arrive with the back-up team, but Faith is soon knocked unconscious. Caleb kills Diane and Molly, and Buffy orders a retreat after managing to knock Caleb down. Xander starts to yell that everyone needs to get out, but is then attacked himself by Caleb. Caleb says ""So, you're the one who sees everything? Let's see what we can do about that."" He stabs his thumb into Xander's eye as Xander screams. Spike tackles Caleb, giving them enough time to get Xander and leave the vineyard. Alone and distraught, Buffy leaves the injured girls and walks through the empty streets as Caleb tells the First, in Buffy's form, that their victory is imminent. Casting. Nathan Fillion played Malcolm Reynolds in Joss Whedon's short-lived space western ""Firefly"". He is also not the only hero of ""Firefly"" to play a villain in the Buffyverse. Gina Torres, who played Zoe Washburne on ""Firefly"", also portrayed the villain Jasmine on ""Angel""; also on ""Angel"", Adam Baldwin, who played Jayne Cobb, portrayed Marcus Hamilton. Rachel Bilson (who that same year joined the cast of ""The O.C."") plays Colleen, one of the Potential Slayers who seduces Xander in his dream at the beginning of the episode. "
wikipedia-2272321," Eugene Kaspersky  Eugene Kaspersky (Russian: Евгений Валентинович Касперский, Yevgeniy Valentinovich Kasperskiy; born 4 October 1965 in Novorossiysk, USSR) is a Russian specialist in the information security field. He has written articles on computer virology and speaks regularly at security seminars and conferences. In 1997, Kaspersky co-founded the Kaspersky Lab, a developer of secure content and threat management systems and the world's largest privately held vendor of software security products. Education. Kaspersky developed an interest in mathematics during his early teens. While still at school, he attended extracurricular classes in advanced mathematics and physics on a special course organized by the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Later, after winning a mathematical competition, he was selected for enrollment at a special technical school – the Kolmogorov Special Educational-Scientific Center of Moscow State University – where he furthered his studies in physics and advanced mathematics. In 1987, Kaspersky graduated from the Mathematical Faculty Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, an institute co-sponsored by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the KGB, where he studied mathematics, cryptography and computer technology, majoring in mathematical engineering. Career. Kaspersky then worked at a multi-discipline scientific research institute. It was here where he first began studying computer viruses after detecting the Cascade virus in 1989. After analyzing the virus, Kaspersky developed a disinfection utility for it – the first of many to come. Cascade was the first malicious program to enter what is now the Kaspersky Lab Antivirus Database, which today contains well over 100 million samples of malware. Kaspersky joined the KAMI Information Technologies Center in 1991, where he and his associates developed the AVP anti-virus product. Eugene was responsible for AVP becoming the first antivirus software in the world to separate the software from the antivirus database – standard for the industry today. He also came up with the idea of giving AVP the world’s first antivirus graphic user interface.  Cologne Zoological Garden  The Aktiengesellschaft Cologne Zoological Garden is the zoo of Cologne, Germany. It features over 7,000 animals of more than 700 species on more than 20 hectares. The internationally renowned zoo with an attached aquarium and invertebrate exhibit has an emphasis on primates such as bonobos and lemurs, and is active in preservational breeding of animals that are in danger of becoming extinct. In addition, in-the-wild conservation efforts and research focussing on animals of Madagascar, Wallacea, and Vietnam are actively promoted and supported via cooperation with Cologne University and local projects, such as in the case of Przewalski's Horses. The zoo was founded in 1860. The world wars led to a phase of stagnation, and the zoo had to close for two years entirely, after virtually being destroyed in World War II. It reopened in 1947; the aquarium was added in 1971. In 1985, the large primate house, one of the main attractions, was opened. Today, the zoo also features a free-flight rainforest hall with free-ranging birds and reptiles opened in 2000, and as the latest addition a large elephant park. Notable exhibits. Mammals Birds Reptiles European Endangered Species Programmes. Note that not all these species are present/on display at all times. Programmes marked bold are coordinated at Cologne Zoo. Less-endangered species may be kept to train for more endangered relatives. Birds Mammals Gorillas in the 1960s. Dian Fossey detailed in Chapter Five of her book ""Gorillas in the Mist"" how in separate 1969 incidents, two baby gorillas were taken from their families for exhibits at the Cologne Zoological Garden, resulting in over 20 wild, endangered mountain gorillas being killed. Adult gorillas will fight to the death to protect an infant's life; therefore, to extract the infant gorillas, hired poachers killed two entire families, or troops. The zoo was able to bribe the wildlife park conservator by offering him compensation including a free trip to Germany. Fossey herself nursed the infants, Coco and Pucker, back to health, before they were seized by the park conservator and shipped to the Cologne Zoo. Coco and Pucker lived a short 10 years in captivity and then died within one month of each other at the Cologne Zoo. Fossey became more determined after the incidents to combat poaching around her Karisoke Research Center. Incidents. On August 25, 2012, a tiger escaped through an improperly shut gate and killed a female keeper, mauling and biting her, until the director of the facilities himself fatally shot the animal; some police work ensued in the area, and the zoo resumed its normal activities on that same day.    Brachypodium pinnatum  Brachypodium pinnatum, tor-grass or heath false brome is a plant in the grass family, with a widespread distribution in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in calcareous grassland, and reaches tall. The flowerhead is open, with 10 to 15 erect spikelets. Distribution. The plant can be found in such US states as California, Massachusetts, and Oregon. Ecology. The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use it as a foodplant, e.g. the Essex Skipper (""Thymelicus lineola"").    Friedrich Adler (artist)  Friedrich Adler, (29 April 1878 – ca. 11 July 1942), was a German academic, artist and designer. He was especially renowned for his accomplishments in designing metalwork in the Art nouveau and Art deco styles; he was also the first designer to use bakelite. Adler was born in Laupheim; his birthplace is now the ""Café Hermes"", an Art nouveau building in the style of the late Italian Renaissance. From 1894 to 1897, he studied under Hermann Obrist and Wilhelm von Debschitz, in whose atelier he also taught from 1904 to 1907, at the School for Applied Art in Munich. From 1907 to 1933, he taught at the School for Applied Art in Hamburg. In between, he also directed the mastery lessons in Nuremberg, and was busy designing pieces in applied art for over fifty clients. On 11 July 1942 Adler, who was Jewish, was deported to the extermination camp Auschwitz, where, judged too old to work, he was killed soon afterwards. There is a stolperstein in his memory at his last place of employment in Hamburg.    Downfield Sixth Form  Downfield Sixth Form was a sixth-form college located in Stroud, Gloucestershire until 2010. The building continues to provide shared sixth form provision for Marling School Sixth Form and Stroud High School Sixth Form. It provided post-school level education of Years 12 and 13, the majority of which were from Marling School, and Stroud High School. The Sixth Form was part of the Stroud Post 16 Consortium which included Archway School and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College. It is situated in Downfield Lane, Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. The sixth form block underwent extensive building work to accommodate the ever-rising number of students and includes a new Lecture Theatre with state-of-the-art audio visual system. History. In 1996, Marling School and its sister school Stroud High School, embarked on a process of collaboration at Sixth Form level, thereby enriching the curriculum and options available to students from both schools. From 2000-2010 the sixth form operated under the name Downfield Sixth Form before control of sixth form provision was regained by both schools. Application/admittance. Entry requirements of 5 GCSE's at Grade B or above, including Maths and English, and similarly a grade B or above in subjects chosen to study at AS/A2 level. Over the years, outside students joined from Kings School, Maidenhill School (Stonehouse), Archway School (Stroud), Sir William Romneys' School (Tetbury), Deer Park School (Cirencester), Severn Vale School (Gloucester), Rednock School (Dursley), Thomas Keble School (Bussage), High School for Girls (Gloucester), Wynstones and Wycliffe College and a number of other independent schools. Facilities. Most students are taught in Marling and Stroud High School classrooms, by the respective teachers. However, some subjects require that students are taught at Archway or South Gloucestershire and Stroud College. Subjects/Higher Education. At Sixth Form, students are typically required to take 4 subjects for AS-Level, and then drop to 3 for A-Level, though some subjects may increase this. Most A-Level courses consist of 3 modules at AS, and 3 at A2. However, some courses' modules consist of submission of coursework. On average, 80% of Sixth Form students move on to Higher Education - taking courses as diverse as Medicine and Marketing. Most subjects have 9 lessons a fortnight, divided between the Marling and SHS teachers (or on the external campuses if necessary). This means there are approximately 12 study periods a fortnight, and 2 tutor periods. The Sixth Form also offers enrichment periods, where students can branch outside of their curriculum and try new activities. In the second year, unpopular subjects switch to having only 7 lessons a fortnight.    Asterix and Cleopatra  Asterix and Cleopatra is the sixth book in the Asterix comic book series by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. It was first published in serial form in ""Pilote"" magazine, issues 215-257, in 1963. Synopsis. The book begins with an argument between Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Julius Caesar, in which Caesar belittles the accomplishments of the Egyptian people. Infuriated, Cleopatra makes a wager with Caesar promising to build a new palace in Alexandria within three months. Cleopatra summons Edifis, who claims to be the best architect in Egypt. She promises Edifis that if he builds the palace on time he will be covered with gold; if he fails, he will be a meal for the sacred crocodiles. A worried Edifis thinks he needs magic to help him, enlists the help of the Gauls, Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, and Dogmatix. Thanks to Getafix and his magic potion, the work goes forward on schedule, despite multiple attempts by Edifis's arch rival, Artifis, to sabotage the construction after Edifis says he doesn't want his help, claiming Artifis works people too hard. Artifis tells the workers to demand less whipping, which would slow construction. However Getafix gives the workers magic potion. Artifis bribes the stone-delivery man to throw his quarry away, before Obelix beats him up, causing him to reveal the truth, a henchman tries to lock the Gauls inside a pyramid but Dogmatix helps him find his way out, he tries to frame the Gauls by sending a poisoned cake to Cleopatra, but Getafix makes an antidote enabling the Gauls to eat it, then cures the taster and claims eating too much rich food was giving him a bad stomach.

Ryszard Kaczorowski was born 26 November 1919, in Białystok, Poland. His parents were Wacław Kaczorowski of Jelita and Jadwiga née Sawicka. He completed his education at a school of commerce. He was also a Scouting instructor of a local branch of the Polish Scouting Association. Following the Polish Defensive War in the beginning of World War II he recreated the scouting movement – then delegalised by the Soviet authorities – clandestinely, and became a head of the Białystok banner of the Szare Szeregi. In 1940 he was arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to death, which was later changed to 10 years in a concentration camp in Kolyma. Following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement of 1941 he was set free and enlisted in the General Władysław Anders' Army. After its evacuation from the Soviet Union, Kaczorowski joined the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division, where he completed divisional secondary school. He fought in most major battles of the Polish 2nd Corps, including the Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war he remained in the United Kingdom as a political emigrant. Following the demobilisation he completed a college course in foreign trade. Until 1986, he worked in business as an accountant. From 1955 to 1967, he was the Chief Scout, and, subsequently, President of the émigré Polish Scouting Union (ZHP). As such, he presided the Polish delegation for the 1957 Jamboree. Kaczorowski was also active in the Polish political circles and a member of the National Council of Poland, a parliament-in-exile. In 1986 he was appointed the Minister for Home Affairs within the Polish government in exile. As the April Constitution of Poland of 1935 (the legal basis for the government) allowed the president to appoint his successor ""in case the seat is emptied before the peace is settled"", acting president in exile Kazimierz Sabbat named Kaczorowski as his successor in January 1988. Sabbat died suddenly on 19 July 1989 and Kaczorowski automatically became his successor. He handed over the insignia of the presidential power of the Second Republic to President Lech Wałęsa on 22 December 1990, signifying both a recognition of the legitimacy of the government in exile and its continuity with the Third Polish Republic.

It was first published in serial form in ""Pilote"" magazine, issues 215-257, in 1963. Synopsis. The book begins with an argument between Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Julius Caesar, in which Caesar belittles the accomplishments of the Egyptian people. Infuriated, Cleopatra makes a wager with Caesar promising to build a new palace in Alexandria within three months. Cleopatra summons Edifis, who claims to be the best architect in Egypt. She promises Edifis that if he builds the palace on time he will be covered with gold; if he fails, he will be a meal for the sacred crocodiles. A worried Edifis thinks he needs magic to help him, enlists the help of the Gauls, Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, and Dogmatix. Thanks to Getafix and his magic potion, the work goes forward on schedule, despite multiple attempts by Edifis's arch rival, Artifis, to sabotage the construction after Edifis says he doesn't want his help, claiming Artifis works people too hard. Artifis tells the workers to demand less whipping, which would slow construction. However Getafix gives the workers magic potion. Artifis bribes the stone-delivery man to throw his quarry away, before Obelix beats him up, causing him to reveal the truth, a henchman tries to lock the Gauls inside a pyramid but Dogmatix helps him find his way out, he tries to frame the Gauls by sending a poisoned cake to Cleopatra, but Getafix makes an antidote enabling the Gauls to eat it, then cures the taster and claims eating too much rich food was giving him a bad stomach. Edifis is kidnapped and hidden in a sarcophagus in the house of Artifis, but Obelix frees him. Artfis and his henchman are forced to work on the palace, but without magic potion.

wikipedia-2302473," Parlor guitar  Parlor or parlour guitar usually refers to a type of smaller-bodied guitar smaller than that of a concert guitar. Overview. The popularity of these guitars peaked between the late 19th century until the 1950s. Many blues and folk musicians have used smaller-bodied guitars, which were often more affordable, mass production models. Parlor guitar has also come to denote a style of American guitar music from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Noted composers include William Foden, Winslow Hayden, William Bateman, Justin Holland, Wilhelm Bischoff and the American Blues great, Robert Johnson. The music for the guitar includes a variety of dance forms (waltz, schottische, polka), instrumental arrangements of popular songs, guitar arrangements of then popular classical music, operatic arrangements and music from European guitar composers (Sor, Giuliani, Carcassi, Coste and Mertz). The Scruggs style and its banjo rolls are based upon and contemporary with parlor-style guitar. The parlour guitar is also currently enjoying a renaissance amongst fingerpicking guitar players across the USA and Western Europe. There are a number of modern luthiers making parlour guitars in a wide variety of tonewoods. Their defining characteristics are a brightness of tone and an often surprising volume for such small guitars. Although they might be underpowered compared to larger guitars, modern amplification has made sound volume a non-issue. "

wikipedia-2302500," Alamo Scouts  The Alamo Scouts (U.S. 6th Army Special Reconnaissance Unit) was a reconnaissance unit of the Sixth United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. The unit is best known for its role in liberating American prisoners of war (POWs) from the Japanese Cabanatuan POW camp near Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, Philippines in January 1945. Origins. The Scouts were organized on Fergusson Island, New Guinea, on 28 November 1943. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and raider work in the Southwest Pacific Theater. They were under the personal command of Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, Commanding General of the U.S. Sixth Army. Krueger sought to create an all volunteer elite unit consisting of small teams which could operate deep behind enemy lines. Their primary mission was to gather intelligence for the Sixth U.S. Army. The unit was so named because of Krueger's association with San Antonio, Texas and because of his admiration for the defenders of the Alamo. Accomplishments and Legacy. In the Scouts' first two years of operation they were credited with liberating 197 Allied prisoners in New Guinea. In January 1945 they provided tactical support for the 6th Ranger Battalion during the raid of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp. The Scouts were credited with the capture of 84 Japanese prisoners of war, and only two Scouts were wounded in the mission. The Alamo Scouts performed 106 known missions behind enemy lines, mainly in New Guinea and the Philippines without losing a single man. Thus, the Scouts had one of the finest records of any elite unit in World War II. The unit was disbanded at Kyoto, Japan, in November 1945. In 1988, the Alamo Scouts were individually awarded the Special Forces Tab in recognition for their services in World War II and are included in the lineage of the current United States Army Special Forces. Alamo Scouts in the BSA. Former Alamo Scout Sergeant Major Kittleson founded the Alamo Scouts, a local Venture Scouting unit, in his hometown area of Toeterville, Iowa after his retirement from the military. The organization offers a military style training environment for local youth. Troop 253 in East Grand Rapids, Michigan has an Alamo Scouts patrol, named in honor of the original unit. Its patrol motto is ""Remember!"" and the patrol patch was adapted from the World War II unit logo. "
wikipedia-2302514," Enterprise software  Enterprise software, also known as enterprise application software (EAS), is purposed-designed computer software used in the furtherance of the needs and objectives of the organizations; such purposes can vary widely as in a business, schools, interest-based user groups and clubs, retailers, or government, as opposed to software used by individuals. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer based) Information System, and as such includes web site software production. Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools such as online shopping and online payment processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, enterprise content management, IT service management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, project management, collaboration, human resource management, manufacturing, enterprise application integration, and enterprise forms automation. Due to the cost of building or buying what is often non-free proprietary software, with limited offers Free and Open Source ERP software, only large enterprises employ a software program that models their entire business system. As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge. Definitions. Enterprise software describes a collection of computer programs with common business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization. The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality. According to Martin Fowler, ""Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business processes with that data."" Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics, they generally include performance, scalability, and robustness. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example LDAP to directory services) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example). Enterprise application software performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time. Types. Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a ""system"" due to the integration with a firm's business processes. Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories. Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below : Developers. Major organizations in the enterprise software field include SAP, INFOR, IBM, BMC Software, HP Software Division, Redwood Software, IFS AB, QAD Inc, UC4 Software, JBoss (Red Hat), Microsoft, Adobe Systems, Oracle Corporation and CA Technologies but there are thousands of competing vendors globally. Enterprise Social Software. Businesses also use Enterprise Social Software sometimes known as Enterprise 2.0. Yammer Inc. which was sold to Microsoft is an example of such software. "
wikipedia-2302530," SR-47  The SR-47 is a modern assault rifle based on the AR-15 family of rifles created by Knight's Armament Company for USSOCOM. Unlike the majority of guns based around ArmaLite design, the SR-47 is essentially an AR-15 that fires the Soviet 7.62×39mm round from AK-47 magazines, which explains the ""47"" in the gun's name. The rifle was created after soldiers on long missions in Operation Enduring Freedom complained of running out of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition for their M4 carbines but having plenty of captured AK-47 magazines. The SR-47 is basically an M4 that will accept standard AK-47 magazines rather than NATO STANAG M16/M4 mags, along with other minor modifications common to KAC's designs. Development. The SR-47 is an outgrowth of the Colt M4 Carbine's SOPMOD system. Originally it was going to be a drop-in series of parts to convert an M4 or M16 in the field to fire 7.62×39mm ammunition. This requirement was later changed to require the weapon to accept and feed from Kalashnikov magazines. The complexity of this task made the planners rethink this approach and the idea of a complete weapon that could still use standard SOPMOD accessories was born.  After the September 11, 2001 attacks, SOCOM placed an open call for a 7.62×39mm rifle of basic M16 style design. This was known as the SPR-V. Three companies submitted samples: Lewis Machine & Tool (LMT), Robinson Armament, and KAC. After a series of trials, the pack was narrowed down to the RAV-02 Robinson carbine and the KAC SR-47.  The SR-47 is based on the Knight Stoner Rifle (or SR) series. Many aspects of the rifle resemble an M16, but almost all parts are upsized slightly to handle the larger 7.62x39mm cartridge. It uses standard AK magazines and the magazine well is modified to accept standard box magazines.  Only seven rifles are known to exist. Six went to USSOCOM and one was retained in the Knight Co. museum. The rifle uses a custom barrel manufactured by Obermeyer Barrel Co. of Wisconsin. It is machined to accept a custom Knight manufactured suppressor. In 2012 Rock River Arms began marketing a civilian rifle very similar to the SR-47 called the LAR-47. "

wikipedia-2302585," Koevoet  Koevoet (pronounced ) (Afrikaans for ""crowbar""), also known as Operation K and officially denoted as the South West Africa Police Counter-Insurgency Unit (SWAPOL-COIN), was a paramilitary-trained police counter insurgency unit in South-West Africa during the Namibian Independence War. (""Crowbar"" was an allusion to Koevoet's mission of prying insurgents from the local population). The unit is considered one of the most effective fighting forces deployed against communist-backed SWAPO guerrillas during apartheid, although it remained notorious for committing acts of brutality against civilians. History. International Background. At the end of World War I, the former German South-West Africa was granted to South Africa as a mandated territory through the League of Nations. By the 1960s, however, much of Africa was embroiled in a struggle for independence from colonial powers such as Belgium, Great Britain, France, and Portugal. In the southern subcontinent, where many indigenous tribes had been pushed off their lands by settled Europeans, the political situation was particularly explosive. Then governed by its apartheid administration, South Africa watched with concern as low intensity conflicts and guerrilla warfare in neighbouring countries ousted traditional white regimes, often replacing them with Marxist-oriented single party states such as those in Zambia, Angola, and Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia).  Determined to prevent South-West Africa from following this example, South African authorities stepped up their efforts to retain control over their protectorate. When the League of Nations was dissolved with World War II and replaced by the United Nations in 1945, Pretoria refused to recognise the new Trusteeship Council for mandates. Instead, Jan Christiaan Smuts' administration insisted on the right to annexation. In 1950, the UN confirmed that South Africa's legal administration was still in force and that it could not compel the latter to open a new trusteeship agreement. Even after the General Assembly assumed its powers as successor to the League and revoked the mandate in 1966, South-West Africa remained a ""de facto"" ""fifth province"" of its larger neighbour. South African Border War. The Namibian Independence War (and its related border conflicts) began when the South West African People's Organisation commenced its armed struggle against what it termed an illegal occupation of South-West Africa. Disappointed that the UN had failed to take decisive executive action to ensure independence, SWAPO, a prominent independentist group, declared from its Tanzania offices that ""We have no alternative but to rise in arms and bring about our liberation."" This did not come as a surprise to many observers, who pointed out that as early as 1962 the organisation had already announced that violence was necessary as part of an overall strategy seeking change - a decision which allowed authorities to legitimately brand known members as terrorists. In 26 August 1966, the first military engagement was fought when armed SWAPO guerrillas clashed with South African security forces in Ovamboland. A month later, a second SWAPO raid was attempted on a major administrative complex in Oshikango. South Africa soon found herself confronted with frequent attacks on tribal figureheads, government installations, and Grootfontein farming regions - the last of these targets in particular caused consternation among white South-West African civilians. By 1971, the International Court of Justice had ruled South Africa's occupation of South-West Africa to be illegal under international law. At this point, SWAPO was the most effective nationalist group in the territory. It enjoyed thorough support from South-West Africa's largest tribe, the Ovambo, and guerrillas active with its military wing (self-styled the ""People's Liberation Army Namibia"") were often indistinguishable from the local population. From the South African perspective, combating PLAN was part of a counter-terrorist initiative against those who were viewed as pawns of international communism. However, the world community increasingly took the opinion that the conflict was a legitimate bid for national liberation; UN officials unilaterally recognised SWAPO as the ""sole authentic representative of the Namibian people"" and ""the future government of Namibia"". Atrocities were already being charged by both sides, with Pretoria condemning SWAPO's systematic attacks on basic infrastructure and indiscriminate use of land mines. The latter retaliated in 1973 by drawing attention to the mistreatment of terrorist suspects in military detention. Fierce fighting eventually drove ten percent of South-West Africa's population into exile; 69,000 citizens crossed the border into Angolan territory, while another 5,000 fled to Zambia. Among these refugees were potential SWAPO recruits who subsequently sought insurgent training in Arab Africa, the Soviet Union, China, or North Korea. By the late 1970s, contacts between SWAPO and the South African Defence Force averaged one per day; over 900 clashes with nationalist guerrillas were reported each year.  Successful anti-colonial wars elsewhere also had a direct impact on events in South-West Africa. Victorious liberation movements in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Angola offered varying degrees of material support for SWAPO. The new Angolan regime in particular proved an active benefactor, and permitted PLAN to operate from within their national boundaries. Deadlier escalation followed in 1978 when the SADF began crossing into Angola to strike at SWAPO positions; such actions were justified as necessary to prevent would-be 'freedom fighters' from infiltrating south into Ovamboland. 60,000 South African soldiers were deployed to the operational area, and defence costs spiraled upwards - eventually consuming a solid ten percent of Pretoria's total expenditure. PLAN responded by deploying increasingly sophisticated weaponry, including rockets, mortars, and an anti-aircraft arsenal of Soviet origin. Formation. In many countries there is a separation of duties between civilian law enforcement and the military. The former is generally responsible for domestic issues while the latter is deployed in defence of the nation. At first this philosophy was adopted in South-West Africa. Guerilla operations inside the country were dealt with by the police. Insurgents were seen as common criminals that should be processed by the criminal justice system. However, insurgents used military equipment which normal police officers were not equipped or trained to deal with. In 1978, Magnus Malan directed the SAP to establish an intelligence gathering paramilitary unit similar to the Selous Scouts. The Selous Scouts was an elite unit that had demonstrated how small units, trained to unusually high levels of expertise, could have an impact disproportionate to their size. Koevoet was founded under the name ""Operation K"" by Colonel Hans Dreyer, a veteran of the Rhodesian Special Air Service and an avid scholar of counter-insurgency combat. The name ""Koevoet"" was subsequently popularised by people such as police minister Louis le Grange. Koevoet was largely based around the Namibia-Angola border and the Caprivi Strip. Most of the recruits were black policemen led by white officers. A few mercenaries and former FNLA/UNITA operatives from Angola were also known to have served in the unit, along with former SWAPO guerrillas who were given a chance to serve the South African authorities by joining Koevoet's ranks. Early 1979 saw the first Koevoet operations carried out by ten trained troopers and about sixty local conscripts. These were largely involving surveillance of suspected SWAPO activists, known Communists, and other criminals. By 1980, however, Koevoet had carried out several raids on guerrilla camps and engaged in violent firefights with SWAPO fighters. According to the South West African authorities, in that year alone five hundred rebel operatives were killed or arrested by the paramilitary at the cost of only twelve men. By 1984, search and destroy combat operations had taken precedence over intelligence gathering. A large part of Koevoet's later work included APC patrols into guerrilla-held areas. Sometimes mortar attacks were carried out on guerrilla camps, followed by armoured assaults. If necessary, a number of the operators would later dismount and pursue the enemy with small arms. Skilled trackers drawn from the local population were also hired to hunt down fugitives sought by the police. Clashes between SWAPO and Koevoet became increasingly costly and fierce; in 1989 official estimates suggested that over three thousand guerrilla fighters were being killed or captured each year by the one unit alone. Their use of torture and assassination, however, proved to be their undoing; SWAPO compiled a list of atrocities committed by Koevoet which was promptly released to the international press. Even the South African government finally bowed to pressure and tried several operators for murder. In 1985 heavily armed Koevoet squads indiscriminately opened fire on anti-apartheid protestors in Windhoek. Structure. Koevoet was a +-1000-man force consisting of about 900 Ovambo and about 300 white officers and SAP non-commissioned officers (NCOs). It was organized into 40 to 50-man platoons equipped largely with mine-resistant armored personnel carriers called Casspirs and Wolf Turbos for conducting patrols, a ""Duiker"" fuel truck and a ""Blesbok"" supply vehicle (both variants of a Casspir). They rotated one week in the bush for one week at camp. There were three Koevoet units based in Kaokoland, Kavango, and Ovambo with each unit over several platoons. Koevoet's internal structure was the brainchild of Hans Dreyer (later a Major-General in the SAP) to develop and exploit counter-insurgency intelligence. The concept was originally modeled on the Portuguese Flechas and Rhodesia's Selous Scouts.  By the mid-1980s, certain estimates put Koevoet's size at over a thousand troops. The organization established its formal headquarters in the present day town of Oshakati, Namibia. Training. The white officers were either South-West African or South-African police officers and, as often as not, untrained for what were effectively military operations. Accordingly, these officers were usually sent for additional training with South African Special Forces Brigade in bushcraft, tracking and small arms handling and tactics. The Ovambo and Bushman trackers were rated as Special Constables, who essentially underwent intensive basic infantry training although many were captured and ""turned"" SWAPO fighters that had already received training of a sort elsewhere. From a Koevoet operator's perspective, Special Constables were ""Counter Insurgency"" (COIN) (Afrikaans: ""Teen Insurgensie"" (TEIN)), while Koevoet operators were ""Koevoete"" (meaning plural of Koevoet) and had higher status than Special Constables. The trackers of the unit in the early days were local Owambu and not Bushmen as often claimed, but operations were conducted with the bushman and paratrooper ""bat"" units with success. The Owambu, although accepting the skills of the bushmen, were in close competition and were in actual tracking and not just knowledgeable of the habits of the ""tracked"" equal. Tactics. Koevoet operatives learned many of their later tactics during service in the Rhodesian Bush War. A number of the men were originally sent as part of a South African support unit which trained under the British South Africa Police (BSAP) paramilitary. It was because of this past association with the BSAP (Known as the ""Black Boots"" for their distinctly black footwear) that Koevoet would subsequently be referred to commonly as the ""Green Boots"". Several members of the former organization were later offered positions in Koevoet following the end of Rhodesia's white minority rule. Koevoet operations used highly mobile units that tracked groups of SWAPO fighters who were on foot. Their tracks were picked up in various ways, but most often from: Once a suspicious track was found, a vehicle would leap-frog ahead a few kilometres to check for the same tracks, and once found, the other vehicles would race up to join them. Using this technique they could make quickly catch up with the guerrillas who were travelling on foot. The technique borrowed strongly from experience gained during the Rhodesian Bush War. The trackers could provide accurate estimates on the distance to the enemy, the speed at which they were travelling and their states of mind. They were able to do this by ""reading"" factors such as abandoned equipment, changes from walking to running speed, reduced attempts at anti-tracking or splintering into smaller groups taking different directions (""bomb shelling""). Once the trackers sensed that the SWAPO fighters were close, they would often call in close air support and retreat to the safety of the Casspir armoured personnel carriers to face an enemy typically armed with RPG-7 rocket launchers, rifle grenades, AK-47s, SKS carbines, mines and RPK and PKM machine guns. Koevoet members were financially rewarded through bounty system, which paid them for kills, prisoners and equipment they captured. This practice allowed many of the members to earn significantly more than their normal salary, and resulted in competition between units. It also resulted in a complaints being raised by the Red Cross about the disproportionately low number of prisoners taken, and accusations of summary executions of prisoners. Former SADF generals like Constand Viljoen and Jan Geldenhuys were very critical of Koevoet's activities, considering them cruel and crude, and undermining of the army's ""hearts and minds"" campaign. Disbanding. SWAPO's accusations that Koevoet had conducted intimidation of voters during registration for the election was taken up by the United Nations. Consequently, in October 1989, Koevoet was disbanded so that SWAPO could not accuse South Africa of influencing the election. Its members were incorporated nationwide into the South West African Police (SWAPOL). A notable percentage of operators were also known to have taken up work with the South-West Africa Territorial Force. The Koevoet issue was one of the most difficult the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) had to face. Because the unit was formed after the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978 (calling for South Africa's immediate withdrawal from Namibia), it was not mentioned in the eventual ""settlement proposal"" or related documents. Once Koevoet's role became clear, the UN Secretary-General took the position that it was a paramilitary unit and, as such, should be disbanded as soon as the ""settlement proposal"" took effect. About 2,000 of its members had been absorbed into SWAPOL before the implementation date of 1 April 1989 but they reverted to their former role against the SWAPO insurgents in the ""events"" of early April 1989. Although ostensibly re-incorporated into SWAPOL in mid-May, the ex-Koevoet personnel continued to operate as a counter-insurgency unit travelling around the north in armoured and heavily armed convoys. In June 1989, the UN Special Representative in Namibia and head of UNTAG, Martti Ahtisaari, told the Administrator-General (South African appointee Louis Pienaar) that this behaviour was inconsistent with the ""settlement proposal"", which required the police to be lightly armed. Some Koevoet operators later maintained that where the SWAPOL-COIN police forces were weakened in order to meet the demand set by the proposal document, SWAPO had not yet relinquished its position and capabilities as an armed insurgent force, thus necessitating their cautious defiance. The vast majority of the ex-Koevoet personnel were quite unsuited for continued employment in Namibian law enforcement and, if the issue was not dealt with soon, Ahtisaari threatened to dismiss Pienaar. Ahtisaari's tough stance in respect of these continuing Koevoet operations made him a target of the South African Civil Cooperation Bureau. According to a hearing in September 2000 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, two CCB operatives (Kobus le Roux and Ferdinand Barnard) were tasked to give the UNTAG leader a ""good hiding"". To carry out the assault, Barnard had planned to use the grip handle of a metal saw as a knuckleduster. In the event, Ahtisaari did not attend the meeting at the Keetmanshoop Hotel, where Le Roux and Barnard were laying in wait for him, and thus escaped injury. There ensued a difficult process of negotiation with the South African government which continued for several months. The UN Secretary-General pressed for the removal of all ex-Koevoet elements from SWAPOL, with Ahtisaari bringing to Pienaar's attention many allegations of misconduct by them. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar visited Namibia in July 1989, following which the UN Security Council demanded that Koevoet formally disarm and the dismantle its command structure. Under such pressure, the South African foreign minister, Pik Botha, announced on 28 September 1989 that some 1,200 ex-Koevoet members of SWAPOL would be demobilized the next day. A further 400 such personnel were demobilized on 30 October - both events were supervised by UNTAG military monitors. "

wikipedia-2302704," Devil's Trill Sonata  The Violin Sonata in G minor, more familiarly known as the Devil's Trill Sonata is a work for solo violin (with figured bass accompaniment) by Giuseppe Tartini (1692–1770), famous for being extremely technically demanding, even today. The story behind ""Devil's Trill"" starts with a dream. Tartini allegedly told the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande that he dreamed that The Devil appeared to him and asked to be his servant. At the end of their lessons Tartini handed the devil his violin to test his skill—the devil immediately began to play with such virtuosity that Tartini felt his breath taken away. The complete story is told by Tartini himself in Lalande's ""Voyage d'un François en Italie"" (1765 - 66):  ""One night, in the year 1713 I dreamed I had made a pact with the devil for my soul. Everything went as I wished: my new servant anticipated my every desire. Among other things, I gave him my violin to see if he could play. How great was my astonishment on hearing a sonata so wonderful and so beautiful, played with such great art and intelligence, as I had never even conceived in my boldest flights of fantasy. I felt enraptured, transported, enchanted: my breath failed me, and - I awoke. I immediately grasped my violin in order to retain, in part at least, the impression of my dream. In vain! The music which I at this time composed is indeed the best that I ever wrote, and I still call it the ""Devil's Trill"", but the difference between it and that which so moved me is so great that I would have destroyed my instrument and have said farewell to music forever if it had been possible for me to live without the enjoyment it affords me.""

wikipedia-2302709," Shibuichi  It is a common misconception that both copper and silver oxides form, but in fact a detailed study has shown that only copper oxides are formed on the copper rich regions of the material's microstructure, while the silver rich regions are left largely untouched. For most of its history, shibuichi was mostly used to ornament various fittings for katana until the Meiji reforms, when most swordmakers began to make purely decorative objects instead. The material is often used in mokume-gane combinations. Similar alloys have been used elsewhere but the use of shibuichi to achieve different colored patinas appears to have remained nearly unknown outside Japan, until recent interest from artisans in the West. Kuro-Shibuichi (Kin-IchibuSashi)　 Kuro is black in Japanese. Kuro-Shibuichi is different from others in the table. Kuro-Shibuichi is mixture of Shibuichi (40%) and Shakudō(60%) with additional 1% of Gold. Roughly proportion of Silver 9.9％, Copper 87.3％, Gold 2.8％.

wikipedia-2302725," Tonnage and Poundage  Tonnage and Poundage were certain duties and taxes first levied in Edward II's reign on every tun (cask) of imported wine, which came mostly from Spain and Portugal, and on every pound weight of merchandise exported or imported. Traditionally tonnage and poundage was granted by Parliament to the king for life up until the reign of Charles I. Tonnage and poundage were swept away by the Customs Consolidation Act of 1787. History. Charles I's first Parliament, known as the Useless Parliament, broke with tradition and granted the king tonnage and poundage for a year rather than life out of concern over the free-spending habits of Charles and Charles' desire to become involved in the Thirty Years' War on the continent. This restriction was seen as a provocative step by Parliament as it was the King's main source of revenue, and Parliament intended the one-year limit to curb Charles' autonomy by forcing him to request money from Parliament every year thereafter. Although Parliament passed this bill, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led a successful effort in the House of Lords to block it. As a result, Parliament granted Charles no tonnage and poundage rights at all, which, combined with Parliament's efforts to impeach the Duke of Buckingham, led to Charles' first Parliament being dissolved.  Charles, however, continued to collect unauthorized tonnage and poundage duties, and this action became a chief complaint of Charles' failed second Parliament. When Charles moved to adjourn the Parliament, members held the speaker, John Finch, in his seat until three resolutions could be read, one of which declared anyone who paid unauthorized tonnage and poundage to be a betrayer and enemy of England. Impact. Charles I's levying of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary sanction continued to be one of the complaints of his Long Parliament. The refusal of and subsequent disputes about tonnage and poundage rights is seen as one of the many events bearing responsibility for the English Civil War. "

wikipedia-2302769," Ash Crimson  The staff from SNK Playmore created Ash with concept of having an evil main character, contrasting the series' previous main characters. His movesets have been reworked across every game he has appeared, in which gained new techniques as result of his actions in the plot or was modified to balance the roster. Critical reception to Ash has been largely negative as a result of his androgynous appearance and his strong techniques. In interviews and press releases, video game publisher UTV Ignition Entertainment noted that he was not very popular within Western games as his design was more suitable for Japanese fans. Appearances. Introduced in ""The King of Fighters 2003"", Ash stars as the leader of the New Hero Team composed also by Duo Lon and Shen Woo participating in a new King of Fighters tournament. After the tournament, he ambushes the host Chizuru Kagura and steals her powers, promising Iori Yagami to be his next opponent. In ""The King of Fighters XI"", he teams up with Oswald and again Shen Woo. In the game's endings, Ash leaves his teammates to fight each other after revealing Oswald's price for joining him was finding a drug he can only obtain after defeating their pharmacists' enemy, Shen Woo. He later finds a berserker Iori and defeats him, stealing his powers. As his comrade Elisabeth Blanctorche accuses Ash for abandoning his original mission, and having become obsessed with power, Ash leaves stating that Kyo Kusanagi will be his next victim. He also appears as an available fighter in the """" update titled ""KOF Maximum Impact Regulation A"" as well as ""The King of Fighters XII"", games which do not have a storyline.  For ""The King of Fighters XIII"", Ash appears as the only character who does not belong to a defined team. Ash's role in ""The King of Fighters XIII"" reveals that he has working for the organization Those From the Past, seen in ""2003"" and ""XI"". However, he comes into direct conflict with the organization's leader, Saiki, at the end of the game. Ash acts as the final boss of ""The King of Fighters XIII"" as , which is imbued with power stolen from Saiki, who is attempting to possess him. He ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy Saiki. Aside from the main series, Ash has also appeared in other media from ""The King of Fighters"" series. In the anime """", he is featured in the fourth chapter, in which he is revealed as the creator from a city's fire, seeking to lure Kyo into a trap. Ash also appears in the manhua adaptations of ""The King of Fighters 2003"" created by Wing Yang and King Tung. Participating in the 2003 tournament, Ash's team is defeated in the final, but later assists in the defeat of the demon Mukai. In ""The King of Fighters XII"" manhua, Ash is absent from the recurring tournament, but briefly confronts Kyo in an attempt to steal his powers. He is also featured in the CD drama ""KOF: Mid Summer Struggle"", which shows a fake ""King of Fighters"" tournament. Creation and development. Ash was designed with the intent of creating an ""attractive evil character"" in contrast to previous ""The King of Fighters"" hero characters. The supervisor designer created to fit the desired appearance to a ""T,"" little changes done to him since conception. Because of his recent introduction by ""The King of Fighters 2003"", the staff did not want to reveal more information about him, and told fans to look forward to his ""exploits."" Falcoon adds that the main goal for Ash was to make him an ambiguous protagonist that purposely makes players ""feel bad"" for cheering for him. Ash's character design was not made by Falcoon. However, he did add extra details to Ash while he was illustrating him to better fit his character. As a result of Ash's final appearance, the staff joked that his teammate Shen Woo appeared to look more like the series' main character than him. For ""The King of Fighters XIII"", Producer Kei Yamamoto wants gamers who played previous titles from Ash's story wonder what are the character's motives for his actions as well as whether they could relate with him. ""KOF: Maximum Impact 2 Regulation ""A"""" earned its title for three reasons with one of them being the character of Ash introduced in the spin-off series for the first time. Falcoon also labelled the character as ""really wild"" because of his role within the series and personality. Nona, another artist in charge, stated that from the original ""The King of Fighters"" characters, Ash was one he liked as he looked forward to his development.  In ""The King of Fighters XII"", Ash was the character who the staff worked the most. They reworked his moves and speech to be more consistent with the rest of the cast. Producer of ""The King of Fighters XIII"", Kei Yamamoto, commented that Ash was a character players could use to ""show off"", comically adding it was as a result of his personality. His EX version from such game tends to perform more multiple hits than his regular form. Particularly, his technique was commented to fit well within his character due to its ""disgusting"" style.

After ""The King of Fighters 2003"", Ash gained Chizuru Kagura's , a move which allows him to seal his opponents' special moves. After defeating Iori Yagami, Ash gained the Neo Max move which works as his strongest attack from ""The King of Fighters XIII"". During development from the game, the staff thought about changing the animation style of Fructidor for an early one they used in a location test. Reception. Ash Crimson's character has received negative comments from video game publications. When first introduced, GameSpy's Christian Nutt stated that Ash was a ""clone"" of Guile from the ""Street Fighter"" series because of their similar movesets. Nevertheless, Ash's team was praised for standing as new characters from the series with new elements. Lucas M. Thomas, writer from IGN, commented that a major fan complaint was the character's strength in the video games which caused him to become one of the strongest opponents despite his apparent lack of effort within fights. Thomas himself shared similar comments, commenting that Ash is ""nothing if not strange"" in regards of stereotypes, and lamented how many times he appeared in the ""KOF 2003"" manhua in comparison to more popular characters. When the playable characters for the arcade version of ""The King of Fighters XIII"" was revealed, Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek wondered about Ash's lack of teammates and joked that it was possible he was alone since ""no one likes Ash now."" Marissa Meli from UGO Networks commented on Ash's design, placing it sixteenth in a list of ""The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters"". The notable androgynous appearance was jokingly mentioned by Meli to have been done on purpose by the Japanese designers in order to confuse Western gamers regarding their sexuality. Similarly, while placing Ash's voice as one of ""Gaming's Top 10 Deepest Voices"", Dan Howdle from Now Gamer joked about him, referring to him as a female character. Writers from ""Game Informer"" also commented about this, joking about their surprise to realizing that he is actually a male character. When UTV Ignition Entertainment started a poll in which fans voted which artbox would be used in console versions of ""The King of Fighters XII"", an official press release noted that the fans' negative reaction to Ash reduced the number of covers to only two featuring Kyo and Iori. In an interview with Ignition Entertainment's Director of Business Development Shane Bettehausen, Alex Lucard from Die Hard Game Fan stated that SNK fans from the Pacific simply hated the character and complained about his inclusion in ""The King of Fighters XII"" when the title did not have a storyline related to him while they wanted other popular characters from the series to star there. In response to this, Bettehausen commented that he had problems understanding what were the problems regarding aside from his design which he did not find appealing for fans outside Japan. Nevertheless, he commented that as his gameplay mechanics were improved for the game, it would be possible that Western fans would like him now. In June 2009, Stephen Totilo from Kotaku had an interview with Bettehausen, who asked him when playing what was Ash's gender. Totilo replied female to which Betehausen replied that ""KOF"" was progressive with introducing cross-dressing characters. He also commented that fans appeared to be ""warming up to him"" despite his design. Michael Grimm from GamesRadar noted the inclusion of Evil Ash in ""The King of Fighters XIII"" was suitable for the game as it was meant to conclude the character's storyline and pointed out that it was not common to have an ""evil version"" of a character in a fighting game.

wikipedia-2302775," Military camp  A military camp or bivouac (see Bivouac shelter ) is a semi-permanent facility for the lodging of an army. Camps are erected when a military force travels away from a major installation or fort during training or operations, and often have the form of large campsites.

Although ""Thorough"" is largely attributed to Strafford, its implementation can also be accredited to the Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud. Thorough and Laud. Laud exploited his secular and religious roles to implement the policy of thorough in England. Laud used his authority as Archbishop of Canterbury to appoint only Arminian clergymen as Bishops, this in turn meant that most of the vicars that they appointed would also be Arminian. Arminianism is a sect of Protestant Christianity which believes in the ""Divine Right of Kings"" and the (Catholic reminiscent) ""Beauty of Holiness"". Laud hoped that his new, Arminian Church of England would make the English conform into believing in the 'Divine Right' and supporting Charles I's personal rule and setting up of a parliament-independent monarchy. Though English Arminians often supported expansion of royal authority, this did not correlate to support of absolutist monarchies. Arminians challenged Calvinist conception of absolute predestination by introducing an element of free will into Protestant soteriology; that is, they asserted that even the elect (those destined to salvation) could fall totally and finally from saving grace. This idea often translated into acceptance of an increased role of sacraments and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or the ""Beauty of Holiness."" Though this was not necessarily the case. See ""Anti-Calvinism: The Rise of English Arminianism.""  The phrase ""Divine Right of Kings"" has been incorrectly interpreted as equivalent to absolutism. For further information, see ""Robert Bucholz & Newton Key, Early Modern England, 1485-1714: A Narrative History, 2d edition"" and ""David Cressy & Lori Anne Ferrell, Religion and Society in Early Modern England, 2d "". Laud used his authority over the prerogative courts to humiliate the gentry, who were largely Puritan and Presbyterian. As Puritans and Presbyterians, the gentry were opposed to Laud's beliefs and opposed to the idea of a parliament-independent monarchy. It is arguable whether the opposition of the gentry was based on religious grounds or on grounds of their own prospects of personal gain from a limited monarchy. This interpretation flows from Christopher Hill's Marxist interpretation of the origins of the English Civil War. William Laud used his authority over the prerogative courts to punish many people, including Puritan martyr Willia Prynne. In this era, religious issues were constitutional issues as in the case of Charles I and William Lauds attempt to impose the English Book of Common Prayer on Scotland. Ibid. See ""The English Revolution"", ""Economic Problems of the Church: From Archbishop Whitgift to the Long Parliament"", ""Puritanism and Revolution: Studies in Interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th Century"", ""Society and Puritanism in Pre-Revolutionary England"" Thorough and Strafford. Strafford was Lord Deputy of Ireland, and domiciled in Ireland for much of the personal rule, leaving the running of England largely down to Laud, although the application of Thorough in Ireland was entirely down to Strafford. The fear that Strafford instilled in the Irish through the policy of ""Thorough"" can be demonstrated when looking at the ease in which Strafford extracted subsidies from the Irish Parliament as the Second Bishops War approached during 1640.

wikipedia-2302879," Bob Love  Robert Earl “Butterbean” Love (born December 8, 1942) is a retired American professional basketball player who spent the prime of his career with the NBA's Chicago Bulls. A versatile forward who could shoot with either his left or right hand, Love now works as the Bulls' Director of Community Affairs. Early years. After starring at Morehouse High School (now defunct) in Louisiana, Love played basketball for Southern University, where he also became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega. He earned All-America honors in 1963, and in 1965, the Cincinnati Royals selected the 6’8” forward in the fourth round of the 1965 NBA Draft. Love failed to make the team, and instead spent the 1965-66 NBA season in the Eastern Basketball League. After averaging over 25 points per game, Love earned the EBL Rookie of the Year Award and gained enough confidence to try out for the Royals once more. He made the team on his second attempt and played two seasons for the Royals, largely in a reserve role. In 1968, the Milwaukee Bucks selected him in the NBA Expansion Draft and traded him to the Chicago Bulls in the middle of the 1968-69 season. Chicago Bulls (1968–1976). Love flourished while playing for Dick Motta's Bulls. In 1969–70, he became a full-time starter, averaging 21 points and 8.7 rebounds. The following two seasons he averaged 25.2 and 25.8 points per game, appeared in his first two NBA All-Star Games, and earned All-NBA Second Team honors both seasons. Love also appeared in the 1973 All-Star Game, and he would average at least 19 points and six rebounds every season until 1976–77. Love was named to the NBA's All-Defense Second Team in 1974 and 1975. His #10 jersey was the second jersey number to be retired by the Chicago Bulls. Jerry Sloan's #4 was the first. Love's 1995 wedding ceremony to Rachel Dixon took place at the United Center. Post-basketball career. Love ended his NBA career with the Bulls after spending parts of the 1976-77 season in New York and Seattle. He would finish with career totals of 13,895 points, 1,123 assists, and 4,653 rebounds. Love suffered from a severe stuttering problem, from childhood, which prevented him from finding meaningful employment after his playing days were over. At one point, Love was a busboy making $4.45 an hour. Eventually, the owner of the restaurant where Love washed dishes offered to pay for speech therapy classes, and in 1993 he returned to the Chicago Bulls as their director of community relations. One of his duties in this position involves regularly speaking to school children. Love has also become a motivational speaker.

wikipedia-2302919," Heath Shuler  Joseph Heath Shuler (born December 31, 1971) is an American businessman and former NFL quarterback who was the U.S. Representative for from 2007 to 2013. He was a member of the Democratic Party and of the Blue Dog Coalition. During his years in Congress, Shuler made a name for himself by challenging the leadership of his party, which he believed had moved too far to the left. In 2010 he ran against Nancy Pelosi for the post of minority leader. He knew he would lose, but also knew he would gain prominence as a leader of conservative and moderate Democrats. He was one of the leaders of the Blue Dog Democrats, whose numbers were severely diminished in the 2010 election, and had a lower profile in the national media than he had previously enjoyed. Shuler's congressional district covered the Blue Ridge Mountains in western North Carolina; the largest city in the district is Asheville. On February 2, 2012, after a new district map removed Asheville from the district, making it considerably more Republican, Shuler announced his retirement from the House, and did not seek re-election to a fourth term. Early life, education, and early football career. Shuler was born in Bryson City, North Carolina, a small town in the Great Smoky Mountains on the Tennessee border. His father was a mail carrier and his mother a homemaker and volunteer with the Swain County Youth Association; he has a younger brother, Benjie. Shuler's athletic career began at Swain County High School. A standout quarterback who led his team to two state championships and was named the North Carolina High School Player of the Year, he drew plenty of scout attention and accepted an athletic scholarship to the University of Tennessee in 1990. At Tennessee, Shuler gained national attention as one of the SEC's top quarterbacks. He held nearly all Volunteer passing records at the end of his career, although most of them have since been eclipsed by Peyton Manning. In 1993, he came in second in the vote for the Heisman Trophy. Professional football career. Shuler was a first-round selection in the 1994 NFL Draft, taken by the Washington Redskins with the third overall pick. He held out of training camp until he received a 7-year, $19.25 million contract, although most of the holdout was due to Shuler's agent and Redskins general manager discussing the parameters of the contract. The Redskins had fallen on hard times since winning Super Bowl XXVI, and Shuler was looked on as the quarterback of the future. However, Shuler's poor play contributed to a quarterback controversy with fellow 1994 draft pick Gus Frerotte. This was evident when Shuler threw five interceptions in a game against the Arizona Cardinals. Shuler started 18 games in his first two years with the team and was benched in his third year, as Frerotte went to the Pro Bowl. After the 1996 season, Shuler was traded to the New Orleans Saints for a fifth-round pick in the 1997 draft and a third-round pick in 1998. Shuler's statistics remained poor. He suffered a serious foot injury during the 1997 season in New Orleans and went through two surgeries. Football statistics site ""Football Outsiders"" called Shuler ""The least valuable quarterback of 1997."" After being unable to take the field due to his foot injury in his second season in New Orleans, Shuler signed with the Oakland Raiders, where he re-injured his foot in training camp and retired. As a pro, his career passer rating was a 54.3 and in 2004 ESPN rated him the 17th biggest 'sports flop' of the past 25 years, along with the 4th biggest NFL Draft bust. NFL Network ranked Shuler as the ninth-biggest bust in NFL history. Real estate career. After retiring from the NFL, Shuler returned to the University of Tennessee and completed his education, graduating with a degree in psychology. He then became a real estate professional in Knoxville. His real estate company is one of the largest independent firms in East Tennessee. In 2003, Shuler moved to Waynesville, North Carolina, where he lives today. U.S. House of Representatives. Elections. In July 2005, Shuler announced his intentions to seek the Democratic nomination to run against eight-term incumbent Republican Charles H. Taylor. The district covers most of the Western North Carolina mountains where Shuler grew up. When Shuler ran in 2006, he was a tough target for opponents. His ideals seemed to be in line with the traditionally conservative district and he did not have a legislative record. His campaign points were based on “mountain values,” opposing abortion rights, same-sex marriage and gun control. Taylor, an Appropriations subcommittee chairman, campaigned on his ability to bring home federal money. In October, with polls showing Taylor trailing, ""The Wall Street Journal"" ran a story about spending earmarks sought by Taylor that benefited many of his business interests. Taylor poured $2.5 million of his own money into his race, and spent $4.4 million overall, compared with Shuler’s $1.8 million.  Shuler repeatedly attacked Taylor for not standing up more often for the 11th's interests. For example, he blasted Taylor for missing a vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which only passed by two votes. Shuler pointed out that according to the House roll call, Taylor voted 11 times on the same day CAFTA came up for a vote. Taylor was one of two Republicans who didn't vote on the bill, even though he'd strongly opposed it in the past. Taylor, for his part, claimed that Shuler would be an extra vote for Nancy Pelosi, even though Shuler is almost as conservative on social issues as Taylor. In the November election, Shuler won with 54 percent of the vote to Taylor's 46 percent. He carried nine of the district's 15 counties, including several areas that had reliably supported Taylor over the years. He even carried Taylor's home county of Transylvania. Shuler was one of only two Democrats to defeat an incumbent in the South that year. His victory gave the Democrats a majority of the state's congressional delegation for the first time since the 1994 elections. In 2009, a documentary film about the successful 2006 Democratic campaign to retake control of the House, ""HouseQuake"", prominently featured then-Congressman Rahm Emanuel's efforts to recruit new candidates including Shuler. ""Mr. Emanuel’s efforts to get him to run offer one of the most revealing moments in the film,"" including two weeks of frequent phone calls about the balancing of family and Congressional obligations. The film was directed and produced by Karen Elizabeth Price, daughter of Congressman David Price who represents the 4th District of North Carolina. In 2008, Shuler faced Republican Asheville city councilman Carl Mumpower and Libertarian Keith Smith. Shuler was handily reelected with 62 percent of the vote. He easily carried all 15 counties in the district, including traditionally heavily Republican Henderson County. In early 2009, he was mentioned as a possible candidate to run against Richard Burr for the United States Senate in the next year's elections. He chose not to do so. Shuler defeated Miller, retaining his House seat by a margin of 54% to 46%. Although Shuler represents a very conservative area of North Carolina, he has a lifetime ACU rating of just 28.5.  In July 2011, Democrats were upset over the new Congressional district lines that removed part of Asheville from District 11. The area was traditionally very liberal, and the removal dropped the 11th District from 43% to 36% registered Democrats, creating difficulties for Shuler. A Western Carolina University professor said that Shuler would need to ""practically completely separate himself from the Democratic party."" Over the course of 2011, several figures declared their candidacy for Shuler's seat or expressed interest in a possible run.  On February 2, 2012, Shuler announced that he would not be running for another term. Tenure. Shuler was a whip of the Blue Dog Coalition, a caucus of moderate-to-conservative House Democrats. A list of bills sponsored by Shuler in the 112th Congress includes H.R.3065, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act; H.R.2086, the Medical Debt Responsibility Act of 2011; H.R.2000, the SAVE Act of 2011: H.R. 1889, the Gas Tax Holiday Act; and H.R.1434, the International Child Protection Act of 2011.  In 2011, Shuler led a group of House Democrats in pressuring the President to deal with the AT&T and T-Mobile merger. The group pushed for the lawsuit to be settled by the Department of Justice. The group sided with the claim made by AT&T that the merger would create much-needed jobs.  In November 2011, Shuler took the lead in a bipartisan call calling for much larger cuts of the U.S. deficit.  In 2007, Shuler introduced proposed legislation co-sponsored with fellow North Carolina U.S. Congressman Walter Jones to require airlines to have sections of the aircraft where large movie screens would not be visible. Representative Shuler has also been a major supporter of the government of Sri Lanka in Congress. Reportedly owing to his success in real estate, Shuler was named chairman of the House Small Business Subcommittee on Rural and Urban Entrepreneurship during the 110th and 111th Congresses. He has also been a deputy-at-large Whip. Shuler voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 both times it came before the House. He later joined seven other conservative House Democrats in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, an $819 billion economic stimulus bill proposed by President Barack Obama. Shuler also voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act, or HR 3962, along with 38 other Democrats, despite voting yes on the Stupak amendment in the same bill, which prohibits federal funds to be used for abortions. In January 2011, Shuler voted against repealing the law, explaining that the repeal would be immoral.  Shuler voted in favor of HR 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act which would implement a cap and trade system aimed at controlling pollution. In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, The bill contained an exception for ""forcible rape,"" which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape. The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest. Shuler is a strong advocate of gun rights. On January 10, 2011, the Washington Post reported that “n the wake of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords,” Shuler “intends to arm himself more frequently” and is “encouraging his staff members to apply for carry permits.” On January 29, 2011, a Doonesbury cartoon made fun of Shuler's plan to carry a gun.  In July 2011, Shuler was one of five Democrats to vote for the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. During his 2010 campaign, Shuler showed interest in taking the place of Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, if Democrats maintained their majority. On November 4, after Republicans had won a majority of seats in the upcoming Congress, Shuler predicted Pelosi would no longer be a leader in the House. However, if Pelosi wanted to take the minority leader position, Shuler told ""Roll Call"", he would run against her if there were no ""viable candidate"". On November 13, 2010, in a long New York Times article about Shuler, Campbell Robertson noted his use of a football analogy to describe the current situation of Congressional Democrats: “It’s no different than me as a quarterback,” he said. “I didn’t play very good. So what they’d do? They benched me.” Robertson noted that “Shuler has emerged as one of most prominent voices in the debate on the Democratic Party’s immediate future. He was among the first to call for Ms. Pelosi to step down from her leadership role in the new Congress and said he would run for minority leader himself if no alternative emerged (though he admitted that he would be an underdog).” According to Robertson, Shuler felt the Democratic leadership “has been too reflexively partisan” and called for “a more moderate approach.”  Robertson observed that North Carolina “has long nurtured a strand of progressivism, particularly on issues like education, and a Sunday school brand of social conservatism — sometimes in the same candidate,” and that “North Carolina’s curious politics are on full display in Mr. Shuler’s district, which ... includes the heavily Democratic city of Asheville, home to yoga studios and holistic medicine centers, as well as staunchly conservative hamlets scattered throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains.” As expected, Pelosi did run for minority leader, and on November 14, Shuler told CNN he would run against her, though he doubted he would win. Shuler lost to Pelosi 150-43 on November 17, but he was pleased that conservative Democrats showed they must be dealt with. On the opening day of the 112th Congress, Shuler received 11 votes for Speaker of the House, which his political aide called ""the most dissenting votes recorded in modern history for partisan defections during a vote for Speaker"" (Since 1925). In February 2011, Shuler said that ""there has been no communication whatsoever” between the Blue Dog Democrats in Congress and Nancy Pelosi. When Shuler was asked if he identified ideologically with Pelosi or Ronald Reagan more, he chose Reagan. When asked to choose between George W. Bush and Pelosi, he said ""neither"". Post-political career. Schuler will be transitioning to a lobbying position with Duke Energy to direct its lobbying and government affairs in Washington, D.C., in 2013. Personal life. Shuler is married to Nikol Davis, with whom he has two children: a daughter, Island, and a son, Navy. Shuler remains active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. In Washington, Shuler lives at the C Street House of the The Fellowship, a controversial organization which operates the property as a tax-exempt church and a residence for several congressmen and senators. The building became notorious during a series of political sex scandals in 2009, in which current or former residents John Ensign, Mark Sanford, and Chip Pickering admitted to adulterous affairs, which their housemates knew of but did not publicize. In September 2010, ""The New Yorker"" published a piece about the house, focusing on the connection with the a secretive religious organization called the Fellowship. Shuler has attended weekly prayer sessions sponsored by the group since his arrival in Washington. In reference to the secrecy, Shuler said ""I’ve been here the whole time, and there’s talk about what the Fellowship is, but I honestly have no idea what they’re talking about. I honestly don’t know what it is."" "
wikipedia-2302926," Warm Leatherette  ""Warm Leatherette"" is a song by Daniel Miller's project The Normal, released in 1978. The Normal original. Overview. The lyrics of ""Warm Leatherette"" reference J.G. Ballard's controversial 1973 novel ""Crash"", which had heavily influenced Daniel Miller. Together with his college friend, he had worked on a film script based on the book, but after the project was abandoned, Miller decided to ""write a song encapsulating script in 2 and a half minutes"". The song was recorded in Miller's apartment using 2 Revox B-77 tape machines. Series of sawtooth waves were recorded on a $150 Korg 700S synthesizer. Miller went with the record to a few independent music shops, including Rough Trade in London, where it would be played to customers. ""Warm Leatherette"" was released as the B-side to ""T.V.O.D."", the only single by Miller's musical project The Normal, and the very first release on his Mute Records label. However, since it was ""Warm Leatherette"" that gained more public attention, it was featured as the lead song on subsequent single re-releases. Although Miller did not expect the single to be successful, it sold thirty thousand copies. The single was an early example of the then-burgeoning industrial music genre, emerging on a wave of numerous electronic pop experiments of the late 1970s in the UK. It has since been described as having ""revolutionised electronic music with its punk aesthetic, stark sound and dark subject matter"" and has been covered by numerous artists. Grace Jones version. Grace Jones recorded ""Warm Leatherette"" for her 1980 album of the same name. The song was released as a promotional only 12"" single. In 1981 it became the opening song on her A One Man Show tour.

wikipedia-2302964," Active protection system  An active protection system is a system (usually for a military application) designed to prevent anti-armor line-of-sight weapons from acquiring and/or destroying a target. Electronic countermeasures that alter the electromagnetic, acoustic or other signature(s) of a target thereby altering the tracking and sensing behavior of an incoming threat (e.g., guided missile) are designated softkill measures. Measures that physically counterattack an incoming threat thereby destroying/altering its payload/warhead in such a way that the intended effect on the target is severely impeded are designated hardkill measures. Softkill measures. Softkill measures are applied when it is expected that a sensor-based weapon system can be successfully interfered with. The threat sensor can be either an artificial one, e.g., a solid-state infrared detector, or the human sensory system (eye and/or ear). Softkill measures generally interfere with the signature of the target to be protected. In the following the term ""signature"" refers to the electromagnetic signature of an object in either the ultraviolet (wavelength: 0.3-0.4 µm), visual (0.4-0.8 µm), or infrared (0.8 - 14 µm) spectral range as well as cm-radar range (frequency: 2–18 GHz), mmw-radar (35, 94, 144 GHz) and finally sonar range (either 50 Hz - 3 kHz and/or 3– 15 kHz). One or more of the following actions may be taken to provide softkill: Softkill countermeasures can be divided into on-board and expendable countermeasures. Whereas on-board measures are fixed on the platform to be protected, expendable measures are ejected from the platform. ""Preemptive action"" of countermeasures is directed to generally prevent lock-on of a threat sensor to a certain target. It is based on altering the signature of the target by either concealing the platform signature or enhancing the signature of the background, thus minimizing the contrast between the two. ""Reactive action"" of countermeasures is directed toward break-lock of a threat already homing in on a certain target. It is based on the tactics of signature imitation, augmentation, or reduction. Aerial countermeasures. Generally one has to distinguish between infrared and radar countermeasures. The wavelength range between 0.8 and 5 µm is considered as Infrared (IR), the frequency range between 2 and 18 GHz is considered as Radar. In the wake of shoulder-launched missile attacks against civilian passenger and cargo airliners in the early 2000s, various agencies investigated the feasibility of equipping countermeasures such as chaff and flares. Many commercial carriers found the estimated price of countermeasures to be too costly. However, the Israeli airline El-Al, having been the target of the failed 2002 airliner attack, in which shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles were fired at an airliner while taking off, began equipping its fleet with radar-based, automated flare release countermeasures from June 2004. This caused concerns in some European countries, regarding the possible fire hazard at civilian airports, resulting in banning such aircraft from landing at their airports. In 2007, Saab announced a new infrared countermeasure system called CAMPS that does not use pyrotechnic flares, thereby directly addressing these concerns. IR-decoy flares. IR-decoy flares serve to counter infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) or air-to-air missiles (AAM) and can be expelled from a craft according to an anticipated threat in defined sequences. Radar decoys. To counter radar-guided missiles, chaff is used. These are copper nickel-coated glass fibers or silver-coated nylon fibers having lengths equal to half of the anticipated radar wavelength. Naval decoys. Land and sea-based forces can also use such countermeasures, as well as smoke-screens that can disrupt laser ranging, infrared detection, laser weapons, and visual observation. Hardkill measures. Except for countering intercontinental ballistic missiles, hardkill measures generally refer to measures taken in the so-called ""end-game"" shortly before a warhead/missile hits its target. The hardkill measure in general physically affects the incoming warhead/missile by means of either blast and/or fragment action. The action may lead to: Reactive armor. An example of a hardkill countermeasure is the reactive armor found on many modern armored vehicles. Antiaircraft weapons. Another example of hardkill countermeasures is the use of short-range missiles or rapid-fire guns to protect warships and fixed installations from cruise missile, bomb and artillery attacks. Anti-ballistic missiles. Countermeasures are a complicating factor in the development of anti-ballistic missile defense systems targeting ICBMs. Like aircraft, ICBMs theoretically could evade such systems by deploying decoys and chaff in the midcourse phase of flight. Novel proposed chaff mechanisms describe the creation of a ""threat cloud"" by deploying large aluminized PET film balloons which could conceal a warhead among a large number of inert objects having similar radar profiles. Potential performance problems. Clutter. Mountains and neighbouring vehicles reflect radio waves, thus creating radar clutter, which adversely affects radar-detection and radar-lock performance. Top attack munitions. Top attack ATGMs like FGM-148 Javelin (USA), Trigat (Germany) and Spike (Israel) attack the tank turret's top, requiring the active protection system to attack nearly vertically, for which turret might have not been designed. The same is true for an RPG being fired in a steep downward angle from an elevated location at the road below. References. DIRCM and AVePS [http://www.diehl-bgt-defence.de/index.php?id=547&L=1] "
wikipedia-2265392," Proselyte  The biblical term ""proselyte"" is an anglicization of the Koine Greek term ""προσήλυτος/proselytos"", as used in the Greek Old Testament for ""stranger"", i.e. a ""newcomer to Israel""; a ""sojourner in the land"", and in the Greek New Testament for a first century convert to Judaism, generally from Ancient Greek religion. It is a translation of the Biblical Hebrew phrase ""גר תושב/ger toshav"". ""Proselyte"" also has the more general meaning in English of a new convert to any particular religion or doctrine, also known as Proselytism. Two kinds of proselytes in Judaism. There are two kinds of proselytes in Rabbinic Judaism: A righteous proselyte is a Gentile who has converted to Judaism, is bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and is considered a full member of the Jewish people. They are to be circumcised as adults (different from Brit milah) and immersed in a mikvah should they wish to eat of the Passover sacrifice.  A gate proselyte is a ""resident alien"" who lives in the Land of Israel and follows some of the customs. They are not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the whole of the Torah. They are bound only to conform to the seven precepts of Noah, the Noahide Laws: do not worship idols, do not blaspheme God's name, do not murder, do not commit immoral sexual acts, do not steal, do not tear the limb from a living animal, and do not fail to establish courts of justice to be assured of a place in the world to come. Proselytes in early Christianity. The ""religious proselytes"" spoken of in Early Christian writings were likely righteous proselytes rather than gate proselytes. There is some debate however as to whether proselytes known as Godfearers (Phobeomenoi) and/or Worshippers (Sebomenoi) - who were baptized but not circumcised - fit into the righteous or gate category. A dispute over this subject is recorded in the Council of Jerusalem c.50, see also Circumcision in the Bible. History of the proselyte in Israel. Proselytes have had a place in Judaism from early times. The Law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into Israel's community of such as were not born Israelites. The Kenites, the Gibeonites, and the Cherethites and Pelethites were thus admitted to levels of Israelite privileges. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in the Kingdom of Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians. According to the Books of Chronicles, in the time of Solomon (c.971-931 BCE) there were 153,600 proselytes in the land of Israel and the prophets speak of the time as coming when the proselytes shall share in all the privileges of Israel. Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues. The name ""proselyte"" occurs in the New Testament only in Matthew and Acts. The name by which they are commonly designated is that of ""devout men"", or men ""fearing God"", or ""worshipping God"", or ""Godfearers"". On the historical meaning of the Greek word, in chapter 2 of Acts of Pilate (roughly dated from 150 to 400 CE), Annas and Caiaphas define ""proselyte"" for Pilate: In the citation we can also see that Pilate's wife is a gate proselyte. Though drawn to the Jewish religion, she could never become a Jewess as long as she was married to a gentile uninterested in adhering to Judaism. "

It caters to a global English-speaking audience, including overseas Chinese and English speakers in China. History. CCTV began considering English-language international news bulletin actual coverage programming in 1 January 1979 at the start of China's ""Reform and opening up"". English news bulletins began on CCTV-2 in 1984 and became available to overseas viewers when they moved to CCTV-4 in February 1991 and CCTV-13 in August 1991 under permission registered in 1996. Up till April 2010, CCTV 9 was a mixed general interest channel featuring news, travel programming, and language training. In April 2010, CCTV-9 was relaunched as a 24-hour English-language channel, and its name was changed to 'CCTV News'. CCTV-9 entered the United States cable market on 1 January 2002 as part of a deal that allowed AOL, Time Warner, and News Corporation access to cable systems in Guangdong. After the launch of the 24-hour service, the channel was revamped a number of times. The target audience of CCTV News is foreigners both inside and outside China, specifically those with an interest in the country. CCTV News claims its potential global audience is 85 million. However, reported totals of actual viewers vary from different sources. Revamp. The Channel name of CCTV-9 was changed to CCTV News at 7 pm (Beijing Time) on 26 April 2010. Some shows were rebranded while other new shows were added. The English website is managed by China Network Television (CNTV), a web streaming service of CCTV. On 1 January 2011, the channel's former name CCTV-9 was taken over by CCTV's two documentary channels. On 11 October 2012, CCTV News launched its Africa operation in Nairobi, Kenya. On 6 February 2012, the channel launched “CCTV America” and a schedule of daily programming originating from a production center in Washington, DC. Currently, CCTV News has three broadcasting centers in Beijing (main), Nairobi and Washington, D.C. respectively with an additional 70 bureaus across the globe to collect news and report them as it breaks under permission registered in 2001. With new faces, new studios and new equipment, the channel hopes it will strengthen news gathering abilities while it aims at voicing more perspectives from China and from Asia to the world. The revamp also saw the addition of news and world financial markets tickers, similar to those seen on leading news channels. Programming. CCTV News usually airs a live news bulletin in the first half of each hour. As well as a generic news program, there are specialist bulletins focusing on Chinese and Asian news, such as ""China 24"" and business news ""BIZ ASIA"". Programming in the second half of each hour includes, sports bulletins, a travel show called Travelogue which takes viewers to destinations around China and the world, and magazines covering the arts, science and sports. The programs on CCTV News include ""News Update"" and ""News Hour"", providing comprehensive global coverage; and ""China 24"" and ""Asia Today"", delivering the latest domestic and regional developments. Specialized programs include ""Biz Asia"", ""Biz Talk"", ""New Money"", ""Culture Express"" and ""Sports Scene"", providing news and information on business, finance, economics, culture, and sports. Shows such as ""Dialogue"" and ""World Insight"" extend balanced and critical perspectives on current affairs affecting all corners of the globe. CCTV News also provides programs on culture, history, and modern society of China and Asia. In ""Crossover"", hosts and guests of various backgrounds and experiences talk about issues throughout China. ""Travelogue"" is the ticket to dynamic and exciting landscapes in China and abroad. ""Rediscovering China"" explores contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and social changes through the eyes of international visitors. And ""Story Board"" delivers a visual profile of all Asian countries. Programs Staff. The Chinese staff at CCTV News range in experience from interns to media professionals with years in the business. Executive producers, producers and senior news anchors typically have higher education, often from a university abroad. As of 2007, the channel has about 300 staff, of whom 70 are full-time staff and about 30 are foreigners on contract. From 2011, it started to hire English-speaking reporters based in 30 provincial bureaus across China. In May 2005, CCTV News Controller Jiang Heping was promoted to head CCTV-5, CCTV's sports channel, ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Following his departure, due to internal divisions, a new controller had not been appointed by late 2007. Foreign news anchors. CCTV News relies on foreigners as news presenters, some of whom have extensive experience, such as Edwin Maher (a former newsreader and weatherman from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation). Jiang Heping has defended the policy of putting foreigners on air, arguing that “we feel international on-air personalities boost the credibility of CCTV News and befit its image as an international channel. In this regard, CCTV News will not restrict the origin of its employees and choose to build its unique identity through its programming.” The first foreign news anchor on CCTV News was Chris Gelken, who joined the channel from Hong Kong's TVB and presented the 30-minute business show, ""BizChina"". Gelken left CCTV News in 2005 and returned to TVB in 2010. Another personality at CCTV News is Mark Rowswell, otherwise known as Dashan. He hosts ""Travel in Chinese"" on CCTV News and has been honored for his work in promoting cancer awareness in China. In addition to the above, the channel has also recruited Philip Yin of Bloomberg Television and Mike Walter from USA Today for its Biz Asia America and The Heat shows respectively. The weather on CCTV News is currently hosted by Bo Yee Poon, Andy Kline, and Danni Huang Danni Lang. CCTV Africa.

Despite its revamp and recent launching of CCTV America, critics have voiced concerns over the level of self-censorship exercised by the channel especially on sensitive domestic issues in China. Philip Cunningham of Cornell University, who has appeared more than 100 times on China Central Television talk shows said sensitive issues such as Tibet and Xinjiang were heavily edited on various programs. [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/jan-june12/cctv_03-23.html] Ma Jing, Director of CCTV America defends such allegation by saying that the channel edits stories the same way other news organizations do. She said: ""We uphold the traditional journalistic values. We consider accuracy, objectivity, truthfulness, and public accountability very important, more important than anything else.""

wikipedia-2265413," The Hour of the Dragon  The Hour of the Dragon, also known as Conan the Conqueror, is a fantasy novel by American writer Robert E. Howard featuring his sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian. It was one of the last Conan stories published before Howard's suicide although not the last to be written. The novel was first published in serial form in the pulp magazine ""Weird Tales"" in 1935 through 1936. The first book edition was published by Gnome Press in hardcover in 1950. The Gnome Press edition retitled the story ""Conan the Conqueror"", a title retained by all subsequent editions until 1977, when the original title was restored in an edition issued published by Berkley/Putnam in 1977. The Berkley edition also reverted the text to that of its original ""Weird Tales"" publication, discarding later edits. Later editions have generally followed Berkley and published under the original title. Plot overview. The plot is a loosely based melange of motifs from previous Conan short stories, most notably ""The Scarlet Citadel"", with which it shares an almost identical storyline. It takes place when Conan is about forty-five, during his reign as King of Aquilonia, and follows a plot by a group of conspirators to depose him in favor of Valerius, heir to Conan's predecessor Numedides, whom he had slain to gain the throne. To accomplish this they resort to necromancy, resurrecting Xaltotun, an ancient sorcerer from the pre-Hyborian empire of Acheron. With his aid the Aquilonian army is defeated by that of the rival kingdom of Nemedia and occupied. Conan, captured, is slated for execution until the sympathetic slave girl Zenobia risks her life to free him. Conan's quest to retrieve the Heart of Ahriman in order to defeat the wizard and regain his throne takes him through all the lands of Hyboria. After his eventual triumph he vows to make Zenobia his queen. Publication history. It was Howard's only full length novel about Conan, and is considered by many to be one of his best works. It was originally written for British publisher Dennis Archer and was submitted to him in May 1934. Archer had turned down a collection of works in 1933 but made the suggestion of a novel. However, the publisher went bankrupt before the novel could be printed and it was held by the Official Receiver. The story was first published as a five-part serial in ""Weird Tales"" between the months of December 1935 to April 1936 (with chapter 20 being misprinted as chapter 21). It was first published in book form in hardcover by Gnome Press in 1950 under the title ""Conan the Conqueror"", a title retained by all later editions until 1977. The first paperback edition was published by Ace Books in 1954. The novel has been reissued a number of times since by various publishers, notably Lancer Books in 1967 and Berkley/Putnam in 1977; the latter, reedited by Karl Edward Wagner, was the first edition to restore the original magazine text and title, under which most subsequent editions have been issued. Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. published an edition in 1989, with illustrations by Ezra Tucker, as volume XI of their deluxe Conan set. More recently the novel appeared in the collections ""The Essential Conan"" (1998), ""Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon"" (2001) and """" (Del Rey, 2005). It has also been translated into Japanese, Italian, Finnish, French, German, Swedish, Czech, Russian, Sinhalese and Spanish. Position in the Conan series. In the hardcover Gnome Press edition of the Conan stories, ""Conan the Conqueror"" follows the short stories collected as ""King Conan""; in the paperback Lancer/Ace edition, it follows the short stories collected as ""Conan the Usurper"". In both editions it precedes the Björn Nyberg/L. Sprague de Camp novel ""The Return of Conan"" (AKA ""Conan the Avenger""). Reception. Reviewing the Gnome Press edition, Groff Conklin found the novel to have ""real merit"" considered as an imaginative work, but characterized Howard's writing as ""only average laden with bombast."" L. Sprague de Camp, acknowledging that Howard was ""an almost-very-good writer . . . with limiting quirks,"" praised the novel as ""a sanguinary combination of sorcery, skulduggery, and swordplay."" Adaptation. In 1974, the story was adapted by Roy Thomas, Gil Kane and John Buscema in Marvel Comic's ""Giant-Size Conan"" #1-4 and ""Savage Sword of Conan"" #8, 10. The lead story in ""Giant-Size Conan"" #1 was a 25-page chapter from ""The Hour of the Dragon"". The plan was to adapt the novel over the first six issues, but ""Giant-Size Conan"" #4 was the last full color chapter. The story was concluded in the black & white magazine ""Savage Sword of Conan"" #8 and #10. A number of audiobook editions exist, including one narrated by Morgan Saletta (2009-2010) released as part of SF Audio's Second Book Challenge; and one narrated by Mark Nelson for LibriVox (2013).  The 1997 film ""Kull the Conqueror"" is loosely based on ""The Hour of the Dragon"", replacing Conan with Kull but keeping the basic plot of a barbarian king being removed from his throne by the machinations of an undead sorcerer.

wikipedia-2265432," Teisco  Teisco (テスコ) was a Japanese manufacturer of affordable musical instruments from 1948 until 1969, and now the brand is owned by Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (河合楽器製作所; Kawai Gakki Seisakusho). The company produced guitars as well as keyboard instruments, microphones, amplifiers and even drums. Teisco products were widely exported to the United States and the United Kingdom. Company history. The Teisco brand name stands for 'Tokyo Electric Instrument and Sound Company'. Teisco was founded in 1946 by renowned Hawaiian and Spanish guitarist Atswo Kaneko and electrical engineer Doryu Matsuda. The company was originally called ""Aoi Onpa Kenkyujo"" (roughly: Hollyhock Soundwave or Electricity Laboratories). In 1956, the company name was changed to ""Nippon Onpa Kogyo Co."", and changed to ""Teisco Co."" in 1964. In 1967, the company was acquired by Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (河合楽器製作所; Kawai Gakki Seisakusho), who discontinued the Teisco brand name for guitars in 1969 (1977 in Japan), but continued to use it for electronic keyboards until the 1980s.The history described on this book is widely referred by many sites (for example,  , ""etc""), but this book itself has been discontinued for a long time.  Products. Guitars. Teisco guitars were imported to the United States since 1959 or early 1960, and then re-badged as ""Teisco Del Rey"" after 1964. Teisco guitars were also imported in the U.S. under several brand names including ""Silvertone"", ""Kent"", ""Beltone"", ""Duke"", ""Encore,"" ""Heit Deluxe"", ""Jedson"", ""Kimberly"", ""Kingston"", ""Lyle"", ""Norma"", ""Tulio"" and ""World Teisco"". Likewise, they were imported in the U.K under such labels as ""Arbiter"", ""Sonatone"", ""Audition"", ""Kay"" and ""Top Twenty"". While guitars manufactured by Teisco were ubiquitous in their day, they are now very collectable. In fact, highly sought after models are now being reproduced.  From 1948 to the early 1960s Teisco products often, like many Japanese products of the period, shared several designs with American and Western European products of the time including Hagström and EKO. However, in the early 1960s Teisco products became increasingly unique. Teisco guitars became notable for unusual body shapes, such as the ""May Queen"" design resembling an artist's palette, or other unusual features such as having four pickups (most guitars have two or three). The vast amount of controls; typically an individual switch for each pickup, plus a tone or phase-cancellation switch, along with as many as five tone and volume knobs gave a wide variety of sounds yet were easily switched while playing. After Kawai bought Teisco in 1967, they started to produce all the Teisco guitars, as well as their own brand, ""Apollo"". Hound Dog Taylor famously used a variety of these Kawai-era Teiscos, which he bought at his local Sears department store. Jim Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain used a ""Spectrum V"". Also, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins played a ""K-2L"", which can seen in the music video for Rocket (The Smashing Pumpkins song) as well as the inside of the Pisces Iscariot cd jewel case.  Many Teisco guitars had a primitive tailed bridge in their extended tail bridges with limited timbre when used in an extended technique. When the strings are attacked behind the bridge, a 3rd bridge sound is created. This is one of the reasons these guitars became popular again during the 90s among many noise artists as a cheaper alternative for the Fender Jaguar or Jazzmaster, which were beginning to attract collector interest. Baritone guitars. Teisco also produced a six-string bass called ""TB-64"" (or ""ET-320"") in 1964, similar to the Fender Bass VI which was itself an uncommon instrument. Teisco six-string bass followed an unusual body shape that was used on one of their guitars. It had an off-set body shape similar to a Jazzmaster, but with an extended top horn, a 'monkey handle' cutout on the left-facing side of the bridge and a Fender-style headstock with an over-sized scroll. This instrument, as well as its regular-scale guitar equivalent, can be heard extensively on Blonde Redhead's early albums of the 90's, where they used its wide range to switch between bass and guitar melodies in the course of single songs.  Also, 2 or 4-pickup baritone guitars (27 3/4 inch scale) with a tremolo, known as ""Demian"" or ""Orlando"" ""VN-2"" or ""VN-4"" ca.1964 manufactured by FujiGen,In the first half of 1960s, FujiGen had subcontracted with Teisco, and manufactured models including: ""J-1"", ""J-2"", ""EB-1"" (similar to ""EB-18""), ""VN-2"", and ""VN-4""; And then, their former factory manager had spin-out to establish a Teisco factory in Toyoshina, called Teisco String Instruments, Company (also known as ""Matsumoto Teisco"").  are often referred as Teisco models. However the formal relations between Teisco and these models are not enough verified yet. The ""VN-2"" is used by The Noble Gasses. Basses. Teisco basses are easily identified through a unique pickup design exclusive to the Del Rey series. This design consisted of a large rectangular chrome pickup with black plastic holding the four poles in one place. Other designs may vary, but are all easily distinguishable and unique among subsequent bass designs. Amplifiers. Teisco also produced numerous models of guitar and bass amplifiers which were often sold under the ""Checkmate"" brand name, but also named Teisco or Silvertone as well as Beltone and Melody. In the 1950s, early amplifier models were very basic 5-10 watt tube/valve designs. During the 1960s, more advanced and powerful models were offered, such as ""Checkmate 25"", ""Checkmate 50"",and ""Checkmate 100"" featuring dual channels, reverb and tremolo effects. Teisco also made solid-state (transistor-based) models, some designed no less radically than their guitars of the time. The ""Sound Port 60"" (60 watts/RMS) and ""Sound Port 120"" (120 watts/RMS) amplifiers from the late 1960s were copies of Fender's silverfaced Vibro Champ and Twin Reverb.  Synthesizers. Teisco also produced a range of synthesizers, with models including the 60F, 110F, 100F, 100P, SX-210, SX-240, and SX-400. Bands such as Hot Chip (UK), Pure Reason Revolution (UK), and Goose (Belgium) are known to use Teisco synthesizers. Drums. Teisco marketed drum sets in limited sizes and configurations during the 1960s, sold under the brand name ""Del Ray"". They were produced by sub-contractors to fill out the company's catalog as a supplier of combo instruments, but discontinued after the acquisition by Kawai. "
wikipedia-2265435," Arabic chat alphabet  The Arabic chat alphabet, also known as Arabizi (Arabic: عربيزي ""‘Arabizi"" ), Arabish, Araby, (Arabic: عربي ""‘Araby"" ), or Franco-Arab, is an alphabet used to communicate in the Arabic language over the Internet or for sending messages via cellular phones when the actual Arabic alphabet is unavailable for technical reasons. It is a character encoding of Arabic to the Latin script and the Arabic numerals. Users of this alphabet have developed some special notations to transliterate some of the letters that do not exist in the basic Latin script (ASCII). History. During the last decades of the 20th century and especially since the 1990s, Western text communication technologies became increasingly prevalent in the Arab world, such as personal computers, the World Wide Web, email, bulletin board systems, IRC, instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using Latin script only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic alphabet as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text in to English using Latin script. To handle those Arabic letters that do not have an approximate phonetic equivalent in the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral ""3"" is used to represent the Arabic letter ⟨⟩ (""""), note the usage of the mirroring technique to create a visual similarity between the Arabic letter and its numeral substitution. Many users of mobile phones and computers use Arabish even when their system supports the Arabic script because they do not always have Arabic keyboards, or because they are more familiar with the QWERTY keyboard layout for typing. Usage. Online communications, such as IRC, bulletin board systems, and blogs, are often run on systems or over protocols which don't support codepages or alternate character sets. This system has gained common use and can be seen even in domain names such as Qal3ah. It is most commonly used by youths in the Arab world in very informal settings, for example communicating with friends or other youths. The Arabic Chat Alphabet is never used in formal settings and is rarely, if ever, used for long communications. The length of any single communication in ACA rarely ever exceeds more than a few sentences at a time. Even though the Arabic language is well integrated with Windows XP and Mac OS X, people still use it in Arabic forums and instant Messaging programs such as Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger because they don't always have Arabic keyboards. Also, some people are not capable of using an Arabic keyboard as it is much more complicated than the English one. Arabish is used on many public advertisements by large multinationals. Because of its widespread use, large players in the online industry like Google and Microsoft introduced tools that convert text written in Arabish to Arabic. A Chrome extension exists to transliterate Arabic webpages. Comparison table. Because of the informal nature of this system, there is no single ""correct"" way, so some character usage overlaps.  Most of the characters in the system make use of the roman character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one wants to express (for example, corresponds to ""b""). This may sometimes vary due to regional variations in the pronunciation of the Arabic letter (e.g. might be transliterated as ""j"" in the Levantine dialect, or as ""g"" in the Egyptian dialect). Those letters that do not have a close phonetic approximate in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically approximate the Arabic letter that one wants to express (e.g. is represented using the numeral ""3"" because the latter looks like a horizontal reflection of the former).  Since many letters are distinguished from others solely by a dot above or below the main character, the conversions frequently used the same letter or number with an apostrophe added after or before (e.g. ""3""' is used to represent ). In Iraq and sometimes Persian Gulf, it may be used to transcribe , but most often transcribed as , while in Egypt it's used for transcribing (which can be a reduction of ). Depending on the region, different letters may be used for the same phoneme. Criticism. Conservative Muslims, as well as Pan-Arabists and some Arab-nationalists, view Arabish as a detrimental form of Westernization. Arabish emerged amid a growing trend among Arab youth, especially in Lebanon and Jordan, to incorporate English into Arabic as a form of slang. Arabish is used to replace Arabic script, and this raises concerns regarding the preservation of the quality of the language. "
wikipedia-2265449," Red Nails  ""Red Nails"" is the last of the stories about Conan the Cimmerian written by American author Robert E. Howard. A novella, it was originally serialized in ""Weird Tales"" magazine from July to October 1936. It is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan encountering a lost city in which the degenerate inhabitants are proactively resigned to their own destruction. Due to its grim themes of decay and death, the story is considered a classic of Conan lore and is often cited by Howard scholars as one of his best tales. The story was republished in the collections ""The Sword of Conan"" (Gnome Press, 1952) and ""Conan the Warrior"" (Lancer Books, 1967). It was first published by itself in book form by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in 1975 as volume IV of their deluxe Conan set. It has most recently been republished in the collections ""The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon"" (Gollancz,2001) and ""The Conquering Sword of Conan"" (Del Rey, 2005) (published in the United Kingdom by Wandering Star as """"), as well as ""The Best of Robert E. Howard, Volume 2: Grim Lands"" (Del Rey, 2007). Plot summary. ""Red Nails"" begins in the jungles far to the south of any known civilized or barbarian lands. Valeria of the Red Brotherhood enters this wilderness, fleeing persecution after killing a would-be rapist. She is followed into the wilderness by Conan, a fellow adventurer who hopes to make her his woman. They meet and quarrel, but their stand-off is interrupted by a ""dragon"" (actually a dinosaur, though described with the characteristics of a stegosaurus and an allosaur) that mauls their horses. They retreat to a crag the monster cannot scale, but are trapped without food or water. Conan recognizes some poisonous fruit growing nearby. The pair fashion a spear, coat the tip with poison from the fruit, and thrust it into the jaws of the monster. Although blinded, the raging monster pursues them by their scent. Overtaken, Conan whirls to face the beast and lures it to its death. Conan and Valeria emerge from the forest and make their way to a strange walled city they spotted from the crag. There are no grazing herds or cultivated fields; they assume the city is deserted. When they arrive at the city, Conan forces open the door, long since rusted shut. The couple enter a bizarre twilight world. The city, which they come to know as Xuchotl, is a single massive structure completely enclosed and roofed over. A single great hallway runs the length of the city, but there are no other streets or open courtyards. It consists entirely of four tiers of rooms, chambers and passageways. Xuchotl is constructed of jade with traces of other exotic materials. The pair separate to search the city's seemingly empty halls. Valeria encounters a man named Techotl whom she joins in a fray between two factions that dwell in the once populous city. Aided by Conan, they defeat their enemies. Techotl invites Conan and Valeria into the stronghold of his people, the Tecuhltli. They are welcomed by the rulers, Olmec and Tascela. As Conan and Valeria rest, Olmec recounts the history of his people. The city of Xuchotil was built long before its current inhabitants arrived. In those earlier times, a slave — Tolkemec — betrayed his masters and guided the newly arrived invaders into the city where they put to death the original builders. The conquerors were led by two brothers, Tecuhltli and Xotalanc, who afterward ruled peacefully over the city until a feud developed when Tecuhltli stole the bride of his brother Xotalanc. The slave Tolkemec betrayed both sides for his own purposes and was exiled to the catacombs. As Olmec tells his tale, Tascela becomes enraptured with Valeria. Later she has a slave attempt to drug Valeria with the black lotus, a powerful narcotic plant. Valeria manages to overpower the slave and attempts to force her to reveal the motive behind such treachery. However, the slave feigns submission and escapes. Valeria's pursuit of the slave is interrupted when the Xotalancas breach the Tecuhltli defenses. In the end the Xotalancas are exterminated and only Conan, Valeria, Olmec, Tascela, and fifteen Tecuhltli defenders remain alive. When Conan and two warriors leave to scout the Xotalanc stronghold, Valeria is left behind while her wounds are tended. Olmec attempts to force himself on Valeria, but he is thwarted by Tascela. She is revealed to be a sorceress and the stolen bride who originally started the feud. She plans to use Valeria's vitality to restore her youth. Erstwhile, Olmec secretly ordered his two warriors to slay Conan. Conan kills them and hurries back for Valeria. Returning to Tecuhltli, Conan finds Olmec bound and tortured. Conan releases him, but Olmec attempts another betrayal and Conan slays him. Conan comes upon Tascela who has Valeria pinned to an altar. Conan, caught in a steel trap, watches powerlessly as Tascela proceeds with the sacrifice of Valeria. The scene is interrupted by Tolkemec who has returned from the catacombs, wielding a wand of terrible destructive power. Desperate for assistance against Tolkemec, Tascela frees Conan. Conan is able to defeat Tolkemec. Valeria, freed, avenges herself upon Tascela with a dagger thrust to the heart. With the last inhabitants of Xuchotl slain, Conan and Valeria depart the dead city. Primary Characters. Valeria. Valeria is a pirate who had been serving as a mercenary soldier just prior to the story's events. Like Conan, she is a famous adventurer. Most of ""Red Nails"" is told from Valeria's point of view. ""She was tall, full-bosomed and large-limbed, with compact shoulders. Her whole figure reflected an unusual strength, without detracting from the femininity of her appearance. She was all woman, in spite of her bearing and her garments. The latter were incongruous, in view of her present environs. Instead of a skirt she wore short, wide-legged silk breeches, which ceased a hand's breath short of her knees, and were upheld by a wide silken sash worn as a girdle. Flaring-topped boots of soft leather came almost to her knees, and a low-necked, wide-collared, wide-sleeved silk shirt completed her costume. On one shapely hip she wore a straight double-edged sword, and on the other a long dirk. Her unruly golden hair, cut square at her shoulders, was confined by a band of crimson satin. ""Against the background of somber, primitive forest she posed with unconscious picturesqueness, bizarre and out of place. She should have been posed against a background of sea-clouds, painted masts and wheeling gulls. There was the color of the sea in her wide eyes. And that was how it should have been, because this was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, whose deeds are celebrated in song and ballad wherever seafarers gather."" Conan. ""[Valeria's] thoughts were scattered by the rustling of the leaves below her. She wheeled cat-like, snatched at her sword; and then she froze motionless, staring wide-eyed at the man before her. ""He was almost a giant in stature, muscles rippling smoothly under his skin which the sun had burned brown. His garb was similar to hers, except that he wore a broad leather belt instead of a girdle. Broadsword and poniard hung from this belt ""'Conan, the Cimmerian!' ejaculated the woman..."" At this point in the saga, Conan is a seasoned warrior with years of experience acquired in many lands: ""'I was a ""kozak"" before I was a pirate...They live in the saddle. I snatch naps like a panther watching beside the trail for a deer to come by. My ears keep watch while my eyes sleep.' ""And indeed the giant barbarian seemed as much refreshed as if he had slept the whole night on a golden bed. Having removed the thorns, and peeled off the tough skin, he handed the girl a thick, juicy cactus leaf. ""'Skin your teeth in that pear. It's food and drink to a desert man. I was chief of the Zuagirs once—desert men who live by plundering the caravans.' ""'Is there anything you haven't been?' inquired the girl, half in derision and half in fascination."" Techotl. Techotl is typical of the warriors of Xuchotl. Howard relates Valeria's impressions of her first sight of one such warrior: ""...He was slightly above middle height, very dark, though not negroid. He was naked but for a scanty silk clout that only partly covered his muscular hips, and a leather girdle, a hand's breadth broad, about his lean waist. His long black hair hung in lank strands about his shoulders, giving him a wild appearance. He was gaunt, but knots and cords of muscles stood out on his arms and legs, without that fleshy padding that presents a pleasing symmetry of contour. He was built with an economy that was almost repellent."" Techotl befriends Conan and Valeria. We are told, ""In the cold, loveless and altogether hideous life of the Techultli, his admiration and affection for the invaders from the outer world formed a warm, human oasis, constituted a tie that connected him with a more natural humanity that was totally lacking in his fellows, whose only emotions were hate, lust and the urge of sadistic cruelty."" Olmec and Tascela. ""On a wide ivory seat on a jade dais sat a man and a woman who differed subtly from the others. He was a giant, with an enormous sweep of breast and the shoulders of a bull. Unlike the others, he was bearded, with a thick, blue-black beard which fell almost to his broad girdle. He wore a robe of purple silk which reflected changing sheens of color with his every movement, and one wide sleeve, drawn back to his elbow, revealed a forearm massive with corded muscles. The band which confined his blue-black locks was set with glittering jewels. ""The woman beside him sprang to her feet with a startled exclamation as the strangers entered, and her eyes, passing over Conan, fixed themselves with burning intensity on Valeria. She was tall and lithe, by far the most beautiful woman in the room. She was clad more scantily even than the others; for instead of a skirt she wore merely a broad strip of gilt-worked purple cloth fastened to the middle of her girdle which fell below her knees. Another strip at the back of her girdle completed that part of her costume, which she wore with a cynical indifference. Her breast-plates and the circlet about her temples were adorned with gems. In her eyes alone of all the dark-skinned people there lurked no brooding gleam of madness..."" Tolkemec. ""Framed in the door to the left of the dais stood a nightmare figure. It was a man, with a tangle of white hair and a matted white beard that fell over his breast. Rags only partly covered his gaunt frame, revealing half-naked limbs strangely unnatural in appearance. The skin was not that of a normal human. There was a suggestion of ""scaliness"" about it, as if the owner had dwelt long under conditions almost antithetical to those conditions under which human life ordinarily thrives. And there was nothing at all human about the eyes that blazed from the tangle of white hair. They were great gleaming discs that stared unwinkingly; luminous, whitish, and without a hint of normal emotion or sanity. The mouth gaped, but no coherent words issued --only a high-pitched tittering. ""'Tolkemec!' whispered Tascela, livid, while the others crouched in speechless horror. 'No myth, then, no ghost! Set! You have dwelt for twelve years in darkness! Twelve years among the bones of the dead! What grisly food did you find? What mad travesty of life did you live, in the stark blackness of that eternal night?..."" Reception. E. F. Bleiler placed ""Red Nails"" among ""among the better Conan stories,"" citing its ""Extravagant adventure embodying a considerable amount of antiquarian lore and imagination."" Background. Robert E. Howard's stories often express the author's belief that civilizations carry the seeds of their own destruction. Howard found in the lost city genre a vehicle for expressing these views. Howard's Puritan adventurer Solomon Kane explored the lost African city of Negari in ""The Moon of Skulls"", published in ""Weird Tales"" in 1930. In this tale we can discern the influence of ""She"" by H. Rider Haggard and the lost city of Opar that appears in the Tarzan novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs Howard's Negari is ruled by the seductive queen Nakari, recalling Haggard's Ayesha and Burroughs' La of Opar. When Howard moved on to the Conan series, he began to place his own distinctive stamp on the lost city tale. In ""Xuthal of the Dusk"" (published in the September 1933 issue of ""Weird Tales"" as ""The Slithering Shadow""), Conan and a female companion discover an inhabited lost city and encounter its resident femme fatale. Though not without merit, ""Xuthal of the Dusk"" is generally regarded as a second-rate Conan story. However its theme of the decadence of a stagnant, dying culture is clearly evident. ""Xuthal"" is commonly viewed as the direct precursor to ""Red Nails."" The theme of cultural decadence maintained its grip on Howard's imagination. In early 1935 he remarked to Novalyne Price:  The idea that would become ""Red Nails"" continued to germinate in Howard's mind, and later that year he began the actual writing of the tale. It would be the last major fantasy Howard would complete. In 1935 Howard found himself burdened with medical expenses for the treatment of his ailing mother. Payment from ""Weird Tales"" was becoming increasingly unreliable. In early May, Howard wrote to editor Farnsworth Wright pleading for money owed him. At that time ""Weird Tales"" owed Howard over eight hundred dollars for stories already published, and payable upon publication. Wright had been paying Howard in a series of monthly installments, but these checks ceased just when Howard needed them most. Howard explained the circumstances surrounding his need and made it clear that he understood that ""Weird Tales"" was undergoing its own share of financial difficulties due to the Depression. However, he felt moved to state in no uncertain terms, ""A monthly check from ""Weird Tales"" may well mean for me the difference between a life that is at least endurable --and God alone knows what.""  Howard received no immediate reply from Wright. A week later he wrote to his agent, Otis Adelbert Kline, inquiring if Kline had any inside knowledge concerning the situation at the ""Weird Tales"" editorial offices. Howard was ultimately moved to concentrate on better-paying markets, primarily those for Western fiction. In a letter to H. P. Lovecraft he confided, ""As for my own fantasy writing, whether or not I do any future work in that field depends a good deal on the editors themselves. I would hate to abandon weird writing entirely, but my financial needs are urgent, immediate and imperious. Slowness of payment in the fantastic field forces me into other lines against my will."" On July 22, 1935, Howard mailed the typescript of ""Red Nails"" to ""Weird Tales"". At the time he shared his thoughts with Clark Ashton Smith, another colleague: ""Sent a three-part serial to Wright yesterday: 'Red Nails,' which I devoutly hope he'll like. A Conan yarn, and the grimmest, bloodiest and most merciless story of the series so far. Too much raw meat, maybe, but I merely portrayed what I honestly believe would be the reactions of certain types of people in the situations on which the plot of the story hung..."" Later in the year, Howard told Lovecraft, ""The last yarn I sold to ""Weird Tales"" --and it well may be the last fantasy I'll ever write-- was a three-part Conan serial which was the bloodiest and most sexy weird story I ever wrote. I have been dissatisfied with my handling of decaying races in stories, for the reason that degeneracy is so prevalent in such races that it can not be ignored as a motive and as a fact if the fiction is to have any claim to realism. I have ignored it in all other stories, as one of the taboos, but I did not ignore it in this story..."" On the verge of abandoning fantasy for more commercial concerns, Howard devoted considerable thought and effort to his final allegorical statement. Adaptations. The story was later adapted by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith for issues #2-3 of the Marvel Comics magazine series ""Savage Tales"". The Thomas/Smith tale was later reprinted in the 1987 black-and-white magazine ""Conan Saga"". It has also been reprinted many times since then, both in black-and-white and in full color, by Marvel and more recently by Dark Horse. An animated feature based on this story, """", is currently in production. Actor Ron Perlman will provide the voice of Conan. Tolkemec is voiced by Mark Hamill in this version. However, there have been no updates to the film's website since December 2007. IMDB currently lists the film for release in 2010. "
wikipedia-2265454," South African nationality law  South Africa rewrote its nationality law since the end of Apartheid in 1994 and the establishment of majority rule in the country under the African National Congress. The 1995 South African Citizenship Act did away with the previous Apartheid-era 1949 and 1970 acts which had granted bantustan citizenship to the country's African majority and inferior levels of citizenship to the country's Asian and coloured minorities. Citizenship by birth in South Africa. According to section 2 of the 1995 law, a child born in South Africa before 6 October 1995 as the child of South African citizens or where one parent is a permanent resident and the other parent a citizen of the Republic of South Africa, is a citizen of South Africa by birth. South African citizenship by descent. Under the 1995 law, a person born outside South Africa to a South African parent is a South African citizen by descent upon registration of the birth under South African law. Naturalisation as a South African citizen. Citizenship can be acquired through naturalisation if these following conditions are met: Naturalisation of an adult also confers South African citizenship upon that adult's minor children. Loss of citizenship by naturalised South Africans. Naturalised South Africans who left South Africa before 6 October 1988 and did not obtain a 'Letter of Exemption' from the South African authorities, may have lost South African citizenship after seven years absence. Dual nationality. Prior to 2004, South Africa in principle did not recognise the multiple citizenship of its nationals unless the citizen applied for an exemption or permission letter under a 1995 law permitting South African citizens to travel using foreign passports. Since 2004, South African dual nationals may travel without hindrance as long as they enter and leave South Africa on their South African passports. Dual nationals may petition for temporary, emergency or ""permanent"" South African passports for this purpose. However, a South African citizen who by a formal and voluntary act acquires the citizenship of another country, automatically loses his or her South African citizenship unless they apply for, and receive permission to retain their South African citizenship before acquiring the citizenship of another country. South African citizens under the age of eighteen (18) years are exempt and do not require permission as long as they acquire the foreign citizenship before their eighteen (18th) birthday. They automatically retain their South African citizenship for life unless; once they have reached the age of 18 and they then wish to acquire a further foreign citizenship. They will then have to apply for prior permission to retain their South African citizenship – failing to do so, they will automatically lose their South African citizenship. Many South Africans have claims to another citizenship (see: Demographics of South Africa). British nationality and South Africa. South African citizens between 1949 and 1961. Between 1949 and 1961, all South African citizens remained ""British subjects"" by virtue of their South African citizenship. This was ended in 1961 when South Africa left the Commonwealth. By the time South Africa returned to the Commonwealth in 1994, the phrase ""British subject"" had been replaced by ""Commonwealth citizen"". Right of Abode in the United Kingdom. As South Africa was a foreign country (under United Kingdom law) between 1 January 1973, the date the Immigration Act 1971 came into force in the UK, and 1 January 1983 (when the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force) South Africans cannot have right of abode in the UK unless they also hold citizenship of another Commonwealth country or of the UK itself. This particularly affects South Africans born before 1983 with a UK-born mother, who would otherwise usually have had the right of abode in the UK.  However the changes to British nationality law on 30 April 2003 have allowed those born in South Africa between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982 to a UK-born or naturalised mother to apply for registration as a British citizen by descent. With this comes a right of abode in the UK. This concession is not specific to South African citizens. See British nationality law Commonwealth citizenship. Following South Africa's return to the Commonwealth in 1994, South Africans are treated as ""Commonwealth citizens"" in the United Kingdom. This includes the following benefits: There are no specific concessions in terms of eligibility for British citizenship, and South Africans must meet the same rules for registration or naturalisation as citizens of any other country.

wikipedia-2265503," Quentin Durward  Quentin Durward is a historical novel by Walter Scott, first published in 1823. The story concerns a Scottish archer in the service of the French King Louis XI (1423–1483). Plot introduction. The plot centres on the medieval rivalry between Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Louis incites the citizens of Liège to revolt against Charles, and they seize and murder Charles's brother-in-law, Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège, under the command of Louis's ally, William de la Marck, who was hoping to install his son in Louis de Bourbon's place (a real historical event which occurred in 1482).  At the time of the murder, Louis is present in Charles' camp at Peronne, hoping to fool him with a false display of friendship. Charles, however, sees through his mask of deceit, accuses him of instigating the uprising, and has him imprisoned. Louis's superior coolness of mind permits him to allay Charles's suspicions and to regain his liberty. In a sub-plot, the Burgundian heiress Isabelle de Croye takes refuge at Louis's court when Charles attempts to give her hand in marriage to his odious favourite Campo-Basso. Louis, in turn, resolves to give her in marriage to the bandit-captain William de la Marck, and sends her to Flanders under the pretence of placing her under the protection of the Bishop of Liège. She is guarded on her journey by Quentin Durward, an archer, who has left behind poverty in Scotland to join the Archers of Louis's Scottish Guard. Quentin prevents the intended treachery and earns Isabelle's love. Charles, though, promises her in marriage to the Duke of Orléans (heir to the French crown) but she refuses, and, in anger, the Duke promises her to whoever brings him the head of de la Marck. This Quentin does with the help of his uncle, Ludovic Lesley, and wins Isabelle's hand. Plot summary. The age of feudalism and chivalry was passing away, and the King of France was inciting the wealthy citizens of Flanders against his own rebellious vassal the Duke of Burgundy. Quentin Durward had come to Tours, where his uncle was one of the Scottish body guard maintained by Louis XI, to seek military service, and was invited by the king, disguised as a merchant, to breakfast at the inn, and supplied by him with money. Having narrowly escaped being hanged by the provost-marshal for cutting down Zamet, whom he found suspended to a tree, he was enlisted by Lord Crawford, and learned the history of Jacqueline. In the presence-chamber he was recognised by Louis, and the royal party were preparing for a hunting excursion, when the Count of Crèvecœur arrived with a peremptory demand for the instant surrender of the duke's ward, the Countess of Croye, who had fled from Burgundy with her aunt to escape a forced marriage; and proclaimed that his master renounced his allegiance to the crown of France. In the chase which followed Durward saved the king's life from a boar, for which service Louis, after consulting with his barber, entrusted him with the duty of conducting the Countess and Lady Hameline, ostensibly to the protection of the Bishop of Liege, but really that they might fall into the hands of William de la Marck. After proceeding some distance they were overtaken by Dunois and the Duke of Orléans, who would have seized the countess, but were prevented by Lord Crawford, who arrived in pursuit and made prisoners of them. Then Hayraddin came riding after them, and under his guidance they journeyed for nearly a week, when Quentin discovered that the Bohemian was in league with De la Marck. He accordingly altered their route, and they reached the bishop's castle in safety. A few days afterwards, however, it was assaulted by the citizens, and Hayraddin having effected Lady Hameline's escape with Marthon, Quentin rushed back to save the countess, and, at Gieslaer's suggestion, Pavilion passed them as his daughter and her sweetheart into the great hall where the outlaw, who was known as the Boar of Ardennes, was feasting with the rioters. The bishop, who was also governor of the city, was then dragged in, and, having denounced his captor, was murdered by a stroke of Nikkel Blok's cleaver. There was a shout for vengeance, but De la Marck summoned his soldiers, upon which Quentin held a dirk at the throat of his son Carl, and exhorted the citizens to return to their homes. With the syndic's help Lady Isabella and her protector reached Charleroi, where she was placed in a convent, while he carried the news to the Duke of Burgundy, at whose court Louis, with a small retinue, was a guest. Charles, in a furious rage, accused the king of being privy to the sacrilege, and caused him to be treated as a prisoner. At a council the following day he was charged with abetting rebellion among the vassals of Burgundy, and the countess was brought as a witness against him. She admitted her fault, and Quentin Durward was being questioned respecting his escort of her, when a herald arrived with a demand from De la Marck to be acknowledged as Prince-Bishop of Liège, and for the release of his ally the King of France. Louis replied that he intended to gibbet the murderer, and the messenger, who was discovered to be Hayraddin, was sentenced to death, the quarrel between the duke and the king being at the same time adjusted, on the understanding that the Duke of Orléans should marry Lady Isabelle. Crèvecœur, however, interceded for her, and it was arranged that whoever should bring the head of the Boar of Ardennes might claim her hand. Quentin, who had learnt his plans from the Bohemian, advanced with the allied troops of France and Burgundy against his stronghold, and a desperate battle ensued. At length the young Scot was in the act of closing with De la Marck, when Pavilion's daughter implored his protection from a French soldier; and, while placing her in safety, his uncle La Balafré fought the ruffian, and carried his head to the royal presence. Lord Crawford declared him to be of gentle birth, but the old soldier having resigned his pretensions to his nephew, King Louis vouched for Quentin's services and prudence, and the duke being satisfied as to his descent, remarked that it only remained to inquire what were the fair lady's sentiments towards the young emigrant in search of honourable adventure, and who, by his sense, firmness and gallantry, thus became the fortunate possessor of wealth, rank and beauty. Historical inaccuracies. De la Marck's killing of the Bishop of Liege is said to occur two years before the historical massacre, which took place in 1482. It appears that Sir Walter Scott made the killing contemporaneous with the Liège Uprising, in order to hasten the pace of the tale. "

wikipedia-2265543," Virtual globe  A virtual globe is a 3D software model or representation of the Earth or another world. A virtual globe provides the user with the ability to freely move around in the virtual environment by changing the viewing angle and position. Compared to a conventional globe, virtual globes have the additional capability of representing many different views on the surface of the Earth. These views may be of geographical features, man-made features such as roads and buildings, or abstract representations of demographic quantities such as population. On November 20, 1997, Microsoft released a popular ""offline"" virtual globe in the form of ""Encarta Virtual Globe 98"", followed by Cosmi's 3D World Atlas in 1999. The first widely publicized ""online"" virtual globes were NASA World Wind (released in mid-2004) and Google Earth (mid-2005).  Types. Virtual globes may be used for study or navigation (by connecting to a GPS device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the world as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. The other issue raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases. Another type of virtual globe exists whose aim is not the accurate representation of the planet but instead a simplified graphical depiction. Most early computerized atlases were of this type and, while displaying less detail, these simplified interfaces are still widespread since they are faster to use because of the reduced graphics content and the speed with which the user can understand the display. List of virtual globe software. As more and more high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial photography become accessible for free, many of the latest online virtual globes are built to fetch and display these images. They include: As well as the availability of satellite imagery, online public domain factual databases such as the CIA World Factbook have been incorporated into virtual globes. Technical info, data, and image sources. Although by default the World Wind download only comes with public domain imagery from the USGS and Landsat 7, Community members have made available high resolution imagery for New Zealand and New York, here and additional countries, as well as Microsoft's Virtual Earth data (for non-commercial purposes) Google Earth, NASA World Wind and Norkart Virtual Globe save a cache of downloaded imagery to the user's hard disk, enabling them to be used offline to view previously viewed areas. However, Google Earth cannot be activated without logging into its server the first time it is used. The Google Earth's cache size is limited to 2000 MB whereas World Wind has no limit on cache size. In Norkart Virtual Globe the disk cache can be set by the user. In addition to downloaded images, NASA World Wind also comes with the complete 500 m Blue Marble imagery and global placenames including countries, capitals, counties, cities, towns and historical references which are available from install. World Wind is also capable of displaying MODIS imagery from the JPL Aqua and Terra satellites. An add-on allows for near-real-time MODIS imagery. Google Earth and Virtual Earth 3D are both capable of displaying many more urban areas in high-resolution thanks to their private image sources. Both companies also hire chartered flights over major cities of the U.S. to take aerial images. Marble (KDE) is designed for use in lightweight environments without 3D hardware acceleration and is capable of not only being used as a standalone application, but also as a component in other applications, such as in a ""World Clock"" Plasma (KDE) and for geolocation in the photo management software digiKam. 3D Weather Globe & Atlas comes with complete 1 km Blue Marble imagery, 40,000 locations database, countries and time zones overlays. Application requires Internet connection only for online features: satellite cloud cover and real-time weather and forecast data. Worldwide Telescope data support includes raster and vector types, the latter including up to 700,000 points in a single layer.. History. The use of virtual globe software was widely popularized by (and may have been first described in) Neal Stephenson's famous science fiction novel ""Snow Crash"". In the metaverse in Snow Crash there is a piece of software called Earth made by the Central Intelligence Corporation. The CIC uses their virtual globe as a user interface for keeping track of all their geospatial data, including maps, architectural plans, weather data, and data from real-time satellite surveillance. Virtual globes (along with all hypermedia and virtual reality software) are distant descendants of the Aspen Movie Map project, which pioneered the concept of using computers to simulate distant physical environments (though the Movie Map's scope was limited to the city of Aspen, Colorado). Many of the functions of virtual globes were envisioned by Buckminster Fuller who in 1962 envisioned the creation of a Geoscope which would be a giant globe connected by computers to various databases. This would be used as an educational tool to display large scale global patterns related to topics such as economics, geology, natural resource use, etc. Comparison. Today's virtual globes can support various features: "
wikipedia-2265557," Regions of Singapore  The regions of Singapore are urban planning subdivisions demarcated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore to aid in its planning efforts. Over time, however, these 5 regions have also been adopted by other governmental organizations in their administrative work, such as their usage in the census of 2000 by the Department of Statistics. The regions are further subdivided into 55 urban planning areas, which include two water catchment areas. While utilized by some governmental organizations, these regions are not administrative subdivisions. For administrative purposes, Singapore is divided into 5 ever-changing districts and further divided into divisions governed by councils and headed by mayors. These subdivisions are incompatible with the regions subdivisions. The regions are fixed over time while the districts fluctuate with electoral redistricting. "

wikipedia-2265563," KCCI  KCCI is a television station that broadcasts on channel 8 in Des Moines, Iowa. It is affiliated with the CBS television network and serves most of central Iowa. Owned by Hearst Television, KCCI has studios in downtown Des Moines. The station's transmitter is located in Alleman, Iowa, about midway between Des Moines and Ames. KCCI is also seen in Ottumwa on translator K23CI, operated by a local non-profit organization. Digital television. KCCI's digital signal on VHF 8 is multiplexed: Analog-to-digital conversion. KCCI ended programming on its analog signal, on VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, as part of the DTV transition in the United States. The station then moved back to channel 8 for its post-transition operations. Also, the ""KCCI"" legal callsign was officially transferred from the now-defunct analog channel 8 to the new post-transition digital channel 8 and the ""KCCI-DT"" callsign was officially retired. Some viewers have had trouble receiving KCCI's channel 8 VHF digital signal, so KCCI has applied for authority to construct a fill-in translator station on its pre-transition channel 31. History. KCCI started on the air on July 31, 1955, as KRNT-TV, the third television station in Des Moines and the ninth in Iowa. It was owned by the Cowles family, publishers of the ""Des Moines Register"" and ""Des Moines Tribune"" newspapers, along with KRNT radio (AM 1350 and the original KRNT-FM at 104.5, which went dark). The calls stood for the papers' nickname in central Iowa, ""the R 'n T"".  The Cowles family and rival KSO-AM (now KXNO; also owned by the Cowles interests until 1942) both applied for the channel 8 frequency and fought over it. A decision was held up due to issues with the Cowles' ownership of ""Look"" magazine. Eventually, the two stations reached a settlement that allowed KRNT to own 60 percent of the TV station and KSO to own 40 percent. Yet once the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the station's license, KRNT immediately bought out KSO's share of the station. KRNT-TV's broadcasting day was originally about five to six hours long, and included a 15-minute news program later in the evening. The station has been part of the CBS network through its entire history, owing to KRNT-AM's long affiliation with CBS Radio. The FCC tightened its ownership rules in the 1970s, forcing the Cowles interests to sell one of their Des Moines broadcast outlets. They opted to sell KRNT-AM and KRNQ-FM (now KSTZ) to Stauffer Communications in 1974 and keep KRNT-TV, which became KCCI-TV, with the initials standing for owner Cowles Communications, Inc. Over the years, Cowles Communications bought several other media outlets, including KTVH (now KWCH-TV) in Wichita, Kansas (and its satellites in the western part of Kansas) WESH in Orlando, Florida and WQAD-TV in the Quad Cities. In 1983, the Cowles family announced it was breaking up its vast media empire, selling off most of its assets except the Minneapolis ""Star Tribune"". While the Register went to Gannett and the Register and Tribune Syndicate (best known as syndicators of ""The Family Circus"") went to Hearst as a King Features division, KCCI and WESH went to H&C Communications. H&C sold two of its television stations, KCCI and WESH, to Pulitzer in 1993. What was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television bought all of Pulitzer's television holdings in 1998.  KCCI began broadcasting in high-definition television on channel 8.1 in 2002. On July 24, 2006, KCCI launched ""Weather Now"", a 24-hour local weather channel that appeared on digital subchannel 8.2 as well as local Mediacom digital cable channel 247, and the station's website until June 30, 2011. On July 1, 2011, KCCI replaced the weather channel with Me-TV on subchannel 8.2. The station operates a website at www.kcci.com. For several years the station's website was known as www.theiowachannel.com, following the practice of other Hearst-Argyle stations, and people going to kcci.com were redirected to theiowachannel.com. In October 2005, the station switched back to the kcci.com name for its web site, with theiowachannel.com serving as a redirect to the kcci.com website. On December 10, 2008, current KCCI President and General Manager Paul Fredericksen announced a staffing reorganization which eliminated six positions, including on-air talent. Weather beacon. A 200-foot weather beacon was once affixed to the auxiliary tower atop the station's downtown Des Moines studios and was a landmark of the Des Moines skyline. The lighted beacon changed colors depending on the forecast: The beacon was active until the 1970s energy crisis, then powered back up by the station in 1987. However, an ice storm in January 2010 caused some damage to the weather beacon, but was repaired later that year. The weather beacon was turned off for the last time on the morning of Thursday September 27, 2012. Programming. In addition to CBS network programming, KCCI airs first-run syndicated programs such as ""Dr. Oz"", ""Dr. Phil"", ""Live with Kelly"", and ""Inside Edition"". News operation. Although it was the last Big Three station to sign on in the area, channel 8 has been the highest-rated station in Des Moines for most of its history, mainly due to its roots in the ""Register."" It often garnered more viewers than WHO-TV and WOI-TV combined. However, in the February 2010 sweeps period, KCCI fell to second behind WHO in the mornings and at 6 p.m. The latter was significant, as it was the first time KCCI had lost the lead in that timeslot in memory. In the May 2011 sweeps, KCCI lost the lead at 5 p.m. as well, but still holds a narrow lead at 10 p.m. On April 20, 2009, KCCI became the first station in Des Moines to broadcast local news in 16:9 widescreen. Even as the other major stations made the upgrade to high-definition local newscasts in the two years following KCCI's upgrade to widescreen, KCCI's newscasts remained in enhanced definition widescreen until April 26, 2011 when it became the last major station in Des Moines to upgrade its local newscasts to high definition beginning with the 5 p.m. newscast. In 2009, KCCI won ""National"" Edward R. Murrow Awards for Best Newscast and Overall Excellence. In 2010, KCCI won Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards for Best Newscast and Overall Excellence. In 2009 and 2011, KCCI won the Photography Station of the Year award in the small market division from the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA).

wikipedia-2265629," Costa Maya  Costa Maya is a small tourist region in the municipality of Othón P. Blanco in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, the only state with Caribbean Sea. This municipality is close to Chetumal (capital of the state) on the border with Belize, until recently British Honduras. The area is generally undeveloped but has been growing quickly and rapidly after construction of a large pier to accommodate cruise ships. The Costa Maya includes two small villages − Mahahual and Xcalak − and extends physically from Xcalak in the south to the southern border of the Sian Ka'an in the north, a distance of approximately 100 km. While Xcalak is approximately south of the Costa Maya cruise port, the fishing village of Mahahual is only about away. Cruise ships can easily be seen from the village. Mahahual has soft sand beaches, grass thatched palapas, and a coral reef a short distance off-shore called Banco Chinchorro, as well as several bars, restaurants, and shops. A new development called New Mahahual is being created directly inland from the port. When ships are in port, the village is busy with cruise passengers. Costa Maya's port has a new and modern tourist shopping mall. The center has a central plaza with saltwater pools and 'swim-up' style bars. There are several jewellery stores and many small shops selling ubiquitous souvenir items. It is generally open only to cruise ship passengers. Costa Maya is the closest port of access to many of the lesser known Mayan ruins in the Yucatan including Chacchoben and Kohunlich. These sites are substantially less excavated than the better known pyramids of Tulum and Coba to the north; Chichen Itza and Uxmal in Yucatan. The port sustained heavy damage due to Hurricane Dean in August 2007. This included the dock designed for cruise ships. Holland America's Westerdam was the first cruise ship to return to the port since Hurricane Dean on October 31, 2008. History. Pre-Colonial. Around 6500 BC the Native Americans started agricultural activities. The agriculture was of the slash and burn type. Around 3500 BC the agricultural skill had developed as such that they formed permanent villages in the center of Mexico. The Maya are not the first tribe to appear in Mexico; they were preceded by the Olmecs near the Gulf coast. The first Maya like tribes appeared around 200 BC in the south of Mexico (Chiapas). The Maya were predominant in three areas: the northern area which is the Yucatán Peninsula, the central area which is the Petén area and the western area which are the lowlands bordering to Belize. The Costa Maya falls under the western lowlands. The agricultural skills evolved between 200 BC and 900 AD to the extent that workers could be made available to build the beautiful cities as we know them today. In the area around the Costa Maya the building styles called Rio Bec and Chennes are found. The Mayan culture weakened during the period of 900 AD to 1200 AD. Other tribes influenced the building styles in that period (an example of this is Tulum). The Río Bec and Chennes sites are some of the most recent found in Mexico. Most of the sites were found by rubber farmers scouting the forest in search of rubber trees. The discovered sites are as follows: During the Mayan high times there was a flourishing maritime trade along the Yucatan coast. The Mayans used large dugout canoes. They traded in fabrics, jade, obsidian, salt, and shells. The area of Xcalak was a landing point because of the two openings in the reef. Xcalak means 'the twins' in Yucatec Maya. A small unnamed site was found just east of the current village of Xcalak. Colonial. Yucatan. The first contact between the Spanish conquerors and the Maya took place in 1502 in Honduras. Initial contacts were friendly; however when Francisco Hernández de Córdoba arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula in 1517 intent on conquest, the Maya resisted. Thousands of Spaniards were killed within a short period of time, giving subsequent conquistadores adequate excuse for subjugating the native population. Hernán Cortés landed in 1519 on Cozumel and within three years he had conquered most of the area, with more help from the smallpox with which his men had unintentionally infected the natives, than actual battle. Twenty years later the Mayans suffered their final defeat by Francisco de Montejo. Not content in having reduced the native population by half or more, the Spaniards destroyed many Mayan artifacts in an attempt to suppress the culture itself. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Mayan territories of Chiapas and Yucatan decided to join the United States of Mexico in 1840. In the 19th century Mennonites came to Mexico from the Netherlands. The Mennonites can also be found around the Costa Maya and can easily be recognized by their denim overalls and checkered red shirts. Costa Maya. The history of Xcalak dates back to pre-Hispanic times, with 16 archaeological sites having been discovered between Punta Herrero (south of Bahia Espiritu Santo) and Boca Bacalar Chico. Seven of these sites are located between Punta Gavilan (just north of Guacamaya) and Boca Bacalar Chico, the border with Belize. In the 16th century, English pirates took over a large part of the coast and attacked Spanish ships that transported gold and riches back to Spain. Spain tried to defend its interests by constructing forts such as the one at Bacalar. Pirates continued to devastate the region, intending to take over the entire peninsula in the name of the English Crown. The reign of the pirates lasted until the end of the 19th century, taking advantage of the indigenous rebellions and the abandonment in which the region was found. At the end of the 19th Century, the Mexican Navy took control over what is today the state of Quintana Roo. In 1897, during the presidency of Porfirio Diaz, a treaty was signed which established the territorial limits between British Honduras (now Belize) and Mexico. This caused serious problems for Mexico because the territorial limit was at the center of Boca Bacalar Chico canal. This natural canal separates the Xcalak peninsula from Ambergris Key, and as a result, Mexican military vessels lost access to Chetumal Bay and remain at the mercy of Belize for permits. Due to the lack of access to Chetumal Bay, Brigadier Angel Ortiz Monasterio, the Mexican consulate, commissioned engineer Rebolledo to find a suitable place to build a port in this area. Rebolledo selected Xcalak because two natural entrances through the barrier reef would permit navigation. The port was established in an effort to permanently occupy this area. From this site, Mexico intended to direct a military campaign to stop the supply of arms to the Maya rebels of Quintana Roo, who were participating in what is known as the Caste War. This led to the establishment of a base on the southern limits of Xcalak peninsula. In October 1899, a site was constructed on the Zaragoza Canal to provide access to Chetumal Bay. (This canal south of town has recently been reopened and re-dredged in another effort to allow military vessels access to the bay.) At the same time, on the Caribbean coast the widening of the entrance through the reef was initiated. In addition, a 'Decauville' railroad was built between Xcalak and La Aguada (on Chetumal Bay) in order to relieve the boat traffic through the narrow international canal. The development resulted in a port system which overcame the lack of a direct entrance into Chetumal Bay. Equipment was unloaded in Xcalak, taken by train to La Aguada, and then reloaded and taken to Payo Obispo, which was founded two years earlier. Thus, the village of Xcalak was founded on May 19, 1900 as the base for the 'Southern Fleet' and the first shipyard in the Mexican Caribbean. At the same time, the first telegraph in the state was built. When the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo was created in 1902, there were three important villages on the coast: Xcalak in the south, Vigia Chico in the middle, and Puerto Morelos in the north. The Xcalak village was the only village in the territory that did not depend on mahogany and chicle (used for chewing gum). Xcalak relied upon fishing and the exportation of coconut. The organization of copra, or coconut ranches, began in Xcalak and expanded to the bay area. Copra exportation eventually replaced fishing. Current. In the 1950s, Xcalak's economy was very healthy, boasting developments such as stone and wood construction, an ice factory, and electric plant, storehouses for large quantities of copra, grocery stores, a billiard hall, a movie theater, and an ice cream factory. Xcalak was the most important supply center in the region. After Hurricane Janet(1955), Xcalak was in ruins. Many of its inhabitants died, including the lighthouse keeper and many sailors. The survivors were traumatized and a large group migrated to interior towns. The survivors who remained in Xcalak returned to fishing. The area was repopulated with people from San Pedro and Sarteneja, Belize, as well as from Honduras and El Salvador. The fishing trade resulted in social organizations. On October 25, 1959, the Cooperative Fishing Production Society of Andrea Quintana Roo was founded. It consisted of 49 members. Fishing techniques were greatly altered with the arrival of the first outboard motors made by Calipso and Lister. In 1980, a gravel road was built, forming the Chetumal − Carrillo Puerto highway. This established a land route between the village of Xcalak and the rest of the state. People often recall that the first vehicle to arrive in the village was a Land Rover. At the end of the 1980s Costa de Cocos and the first dive shop, 'Aventuras Chinchorro' (now XTC Dive Center), opened. Soon after that a second dive shop 'Xcalak Dive Center' appeared. These developments increased tourism and marked the beginning of a new period. On August 24, 1995, the government of Quintana Roo published the decree for the 'Ecological regulation for the area referred to as the Maya Coast' (Punta Herero - Xcalak). The decree outlined tourism development plans for the Costa Maya corridor. Xcalak was designated as one of the sites for the greatest development. The restoration of the municipal pier in Xcalak was completed at the end of 1995 to facilitate tourism development. In June 1996, a ferry pier was built at La Aguada in order to provide service between Chetumal and Xcalak. At the same time, the existing airstrip in Xcalak was enlarged. There are approximately 300 native inhabitants of Xcalak, most rely on fishing for their livelihood; however, many are now working in tourism and recently the Tourism Cooperative was formed. Officials that have their headquarters in Xcalak include: the Municipal Delegation, State Government representative of the Judicial Police, a port captain, immigration officer, and Navy base. As part of the social structure, other associations have been formed: the Parents Association, the Electricity Committee, the fishing Cooperative, and a Community Committee in which different representatives of all community sectors participate. It is through the Community Committee that issues regarding the management and conservation of natural resources are addressed. The resort was hit directly by Category 5 Hurricane Dean in August 2007. The area was also hit significantly by Hurricane Ernesto in early August 2012. Although much of the resort was not hit heavily, the surrounding town of Mahahual has experienced a large amount of damage. Future. The Mexican government is trying to improve the standard of living for the indigenous population. The path chosen to do this on the Costa Maya area is to develop small scale ecologically-based tourism. Mahahual is to be a larger tourist center with an airport and a large dock for cruise ships. Xcalak is to be preserved as a middle-sized village with tourism based on ecological principles. To achieve this development ecological laws have been implemented on the Costa Maya. Sian Ka'an South of Tulum is a protected natural reserve, Banco Chinchorro is declared as a protected archaeological marine park and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System in front of Xcalak is declared a natural reserve park.

wikipedia-2265669," The Roaring Twenties  The Roaring Twenties is a 1939 crime thriller starring James Cagney, Priscilla Lane, Humphrey Bogart and Gladys George. The epic movie was directed by Raoul Walsh, and written by Jerry Wald, Richard Macaulay and Robert Rossen based on the story ""The World Moves On"" by Mark Hellinger. ""The Roaring Twenties"" was the last film that Cagney and Bogart made together. ""The Roaring Twenties"" is based on ""The World Moves On"", a short story by Mark Hellinger, a columnist who had been hired by Jack Warner to write screenplays. The movie is hailed as a classic in the gangster movie genre, and considered an homage to the classic gangster movie of the early 1930s. Plot. The film follows three men who meet in a foxhole during the waning days of World War I: Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney), George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), and depicts their trials and tribulations from the Armistice through the passage of the 18th Amendment leading to the Prohibition period of the 1920s and the violence which erupted due to it all the way through the 1929 crash of the stock market to its conclusion at the end of 1933, only days after the 21st Amendment brought an end to the Prohibition era. Following World War 1, Eddie Bartlett returns home from the war only to find his old job at a car shop is occupied. While naive Eddie (he orders milk at a speakeasy) is pulled into the boot-legging business by Panama Smith (Gladys George), he remeets Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), a girl he formerly spoke to during the war while she was in high school now working at a nightclub. She is an undiscovered star that Eddie generally takes under his wing. But when Bartlett runs into Hally on a boat raid, they agree to work together (as Hally is also in bootlegging). They also meet Hart again who has turned into a successful lawyer. He falls hard for Jean, not knowing Eddie has a thing for her. Due to a bad business deal with Hally however (as well as the stock market crash), Eddie's bootlegging empire crumbles and he's back to driving cabs and having hangovers. Quite by chance, one day Jean steps into Eddie's cab. Eddie is now angry at her for leaving him for Hart and marrying him, so he's stand-offish at first. But after talking, as well as meeting Jean and Lloyd's four-year old son, Jean and Eddie agree to be friends and leave it at that. But, after talking to Hally again, Eddie learns Hally is going to murder Hart because he ""knows too much"". Eddie adamantly protests and after talking to Jean again, goes to Hally's house to convince him not to bump Hart off. This results in a shootout in which Eddie kills Hally {""Here's one rap ya' won't beat...""} and some of his men, redeeming himself. After running outside, he is shot in the back by another cohort, runs a little ways, knocks over a mail box, and then dramatically collapses on the steps of a church. As the police arrest the remainder of Hally's gang, Panama runs to Eddie and, after being interviewed by a cop whilst she cradles Eddie's lifeless body, she informs the officer, ""He used to be a big shot."" Reputation. In 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. In 2009 Empire Magazine named it #1 in a poll of the 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've Never Seen* (*Probably) "
wikipedia-2265679," Rocori High School shooting  The Rocori High School shooting was a school shooting that occurred at Rocori High School on September 24, 2003 in Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States. The shooter was identified as Rocori High freshman John Jason McLaughlin, who shot and killed fifteen-year-old freshman Seth Bartell and seventeen-year-old senior Aaron Rollins. Prior to the shooting, McLaughlin was described as a ""quiet and withdrawn"" student with severe acne.  Shooting. On September 24, 2003 McLaughlin arrived at school with a loaded Colt.22-caliber handgun with the intention of killing Bartell, whom McLaughlin claimed bullied him over his acne. McLaughlin met Bartell and Rollins as they were exiting the school locker room. He shot at Bartell, hitting him in the chest. McLaughlin fired a second shot at Bartell, which missed and hit Rollins in the neck, killing him instantly. Bartell attempted to flee the scene, but was followed by McLaughlin, who fired another shot at Bartell, hitting him in the forehead. Gym coach Mark Johnson then confronted McLaughlin, who initially brandished the gun at Johnson and then emptied the bullets from the gun and dropped it. Johnson secured the gun and took McLaughlin to the school office.  Bartell was taken to the St. Cloud Hospital, where he was treated for severe head and brain trauma. Bartell passed away sixteen days later, on October 11, 2003.  Trial. The trial began on July 5, 2005. The defense argued that McLaughlin did not plan to kill anyone and that the teen had only intended to scare Bartell. The prosecution argued that the deaths were premeditated, as McLaughlin had stated to police that he had planned the shooting ""several days in advance"". Six mental health experts were brought in to testify in court. Three of the experts diagnosed McLaughlin with schizophrenia while the other three diagnosed him with major depression in remission and an ""emerging personality disorder"".  McLaughlin was found guilty of first and second-degree murder. Sentencing. In August 2005, he was sentenced with two consecutive prison sentences. McLaughlin was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder and 12 years in prison for second-degree murder. Prior to the sentences, McLaughlin's attorneys attempted to have him declared insane at the time of the shootings, which would have resulted with McLaughlin serving his sentence at a mental hospital rather than a correctional facility. The Judge ruled that McLaughlin was sane at the time of the killings based on McLaughlin's writings and videotaped confession, where he detailed his planning of the crime. McLaughlin was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $15,000 to the Minnesota Crime Victims Reparations Board.  Jason McLaughlin is currently incarcerated at Minnesota Correctional Facility – Stillwater. He will not be eligible for parole until 2038. Wrongful death lawsuit. In September 2006 the families of victims Aaron Rollins and Seth Bartell filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the McLaughlins, the Rocori school district, and former Rocori High School Principal Doug Standke. The families alleged that the school district had prior knowledge of the shootings about a week before their occurrence and that they could have done prevented its occurrence. The lawsuit was initially dismissed, but later settled out of court for $200,000. "
wikipedia-2265764," Korean Wave  The Korean Wave () is a neologism referring to the increase in the popularity of South Korean culture since the late 1990s. The term was originally coined in mid-1999 by Beijing journalists who were surprised by China's growing appetite for South Korean cultural exports. They subsequently referred to this new phenomenon as """"Hánliú"""" (韓流), which literally means ""flow of Korea"". First driven by the spread of K-dramas televised across East and Southeast Asia during its initial stages, the ""Korean Wave"" evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop (K-pop) music videos on YouTube. Currently, the spread of the ""Korean Wave"" to other regions of the world is most visibly seen among teenagers and young adults in Latin America, Northeast India, the Middle East, North Africa, and immigrant enclaves of the Western world. The growing acceptance of South Korean pop culture as a valid form of entertainment in many parts of the world has prompted the government of South Korea to use the ""Korean Wave"" as a tool for soft power. Ultimately, the government hopes that the acceptance of South Korean culture in foreign countries would be reciprocated by an embracement of foreign cultures among South Koreans, thus realizing the ideals of a bidirectional flow of culture, goods and ideas in order to achieve the following goals: Overview. The ""Korean Wave"", or ""Hallyu"", is made up of two root words - Han (한) refers to a quality or state of being Korean while Ryu (류) means ""to flow"". Both words can be combined to form the compound word Hanryu (한류), usually romanized as Hallyu, which refers to ""the flow and spread of Korea"" and is translated into Indo-European languages as the Korean Wave. The ""Korean Wave"" is based on many different aspects of South Korean culture, such as: Many commentators consider the cultural influences originating from the Korean Peninsula, mostly popular culture from South Korea but also traditional Korean culture in its entirety, as part of the ""Korean Wave"". The American political scientist Joseph Nye interprets the ""Korean Wave"" as ""the growing popularity of all things Korean, from fashion and film to music and cuisine."" Historical background. After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953, South Korea experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the ""Miracle on the Han River"". Following Park Chung-hee's ascent to South Korean presidency in 1961, screen quotas were gradually introduced to the local market in order to restrict the number of foreign films shown in cinemas. Previously, the South Korean film industry was unable to raise sufficient capital for the production of big-budget films. The introduction of these quotas was intended to prevent domestic films from having to compete with foreign blockbuster movies. In 1986, the Motion Pictures Exporters Association of America filed a complaint to the United States Senate regarding ""unfair"" regulations and quotas imposed by the South Korean government on all foreign films. Facing pressure from the U.S. government, the South Korean government gradually lifted its restrictions and allowed major Hollywood studios to release their film productions. In 1988, Twentieth Century Fox became the first American film studio to set up a distribution office in South Korea. This was soon followed by Warner Brothers (1989), Columbia (1990), and Walt Disney (1993). By the year 1994, Hollywood’s share of the South Korean movie market had reached a peak of around 80 percent, and the local film industry's share fell to a low of 15.9 percent. In the same year, the former South Korean president Kim Young-sam was shown a report by the Presidential Advisory Board suggesting that cultural and media production should be encouraged and subsidised as part of the country's strategic export industry. According to South Korean media, the former President was urged to take note of how total revenues generated by Hollywood's ""Jurassic Park"" had surpassed the sale of 1.5 million Hyundai automobiles. With the latter widely recognized in South Korea as a source of national pride, this comparison between the Hollywood sector and the South Korean automobile industry finally led to the government's acceptance and recognition of culture as an exportable commodity. Aa a result, numerous state research agencies were created to boost the nation’s cultural industry. Although the term ""Hallyu"" was coined much later in 1999 by China's ""Beijing Youth Daily"", by the end of 1995, the foundation for the rise and spread of Korean culture was firmly laid out. The earliest mention of using culture to enhance the nation's soft power echoes back to the writings of Kim Gu, leader of the Korean independence movement and president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Towards the end of his autobiography, he writes: History. 1994-99: Early beginnings. In 1994, South Korea's Ministry of Culture set up a cultural industry bureau to develop its media sector. Many large business conglomerates and ""chaebol""s were also encouraged to expand into the film and media sector. Three years later, the Asian financial crisis triggered a turning point in the development of the ""Korean Wave"" as major conglomerates suffered heavy losses, prompting a handful of them to shift their focus away from the manufacturing sector to the entertainment sector. In 1999, the first big-budget film ""Shiri"" was released into cinemas and it became a major commercial success in South Korea, grossing over US$11 million, and suprassing the local theatre attendance record set by the Hollywood blockbuster ""Titanic"". According to ""The New York Times"", South Korea's restriction of cultural imports from its former colonial ruler Japan was finally lifted in 1998. Worried about the inpending ""onslaught"" of Japanese movies, comics and J-pop (Japanese pop), the South Korean Ministry of Culture made a request for a substantial budget increase which allowed it to set up 300 cultural industry departments in colleges and universities nationwide. This led to the development of an elaborate training and export system which the South Korean music industry now labels as ""Cultural technology"". The spread of Korean popular culture began with the broadcast of several Korean TV dramas in China. On November 19, 1999, one of China's state-controlled daily newspapers, the ""Beijing Youth Daily"", published an article acknowledging the ""zeal of Chinese audiences for Korean TV dramas and pop songs"". A few months later in February 2000, SM Entertainment's boyband H.O.T. became the first modern K-pop music artist to give an overseas performance with a sold-out concert in the Chinese capital of Beijing. As the volume of Korean cultural imports rapidly increased, China’s State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television responded with a decision to restrict and limit the number of Korean TV dramas shown to Chinese audiences. 2000-09: ""Hallyu"" in Asia. Towards the turn of the 21st century, other countries in East Asia also experienced a growth in the popularity of Korean dramas and pop songs. In 2000, the K-Pop singer BoA took off her musical career with SM Entertainment and two years later, her album ""Listen to My Heart"" became the first album by a Korean musician to sell a million copies in Japan. Despite the early success of the ""Hallyu""-wave, there was an equally noticeable growth in cultural imports from Taiwan, which, like South Korea, is also one of the Four Asian Tigers. The spread of Taiwanese popular culture occurred slightly earlier, before the ""Hallyu""-wave was known in Asia. In 2001, the Taiwanese drama """"Meteor Garden"""" was released and soon attracted audiences from all over the region. It became the most-watched drama series in Philippine television history, garnered over 10 million daily viewers in Manila alone, and catapulted the male protagonists from the Taiwanese boyband F4 to overnight fame. In 2002, a BBC journalist described the members of F4 as previously unknown actors who have ""provoked hysteria across Asia"" as a result of the success of """"Meteor Garden"""". The popularity of """"Meteor Garden"""" (an adaptation of the Japanese manga series ""Boys Over Flowers"") can be attributed to these two factors: As a result of the success of """"Meteor Garden"""", its sequel """"Meteor Garden II"""" was gradually released into many Asian countries as well, before the source material was later adapted by networks in Japan, South Korea, and China respectively. The Korean Broadcasting System's adaptation of the series was renamed """"Boys Over Flowers"""" based on a much earlier Japanese manga series of the same name. In 2002, the Korean Drama """"Winter Sonata"""" became the first of its kind to equal the success of """"Meteor Garden"""", attracting a cult following in Asia with sales of Winter Sonata-related products such as DVD sets and novels surpassing US$3.5 million in Japan. In 2004, the former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi famously noted that the male protagonist of the drama """"is more popular than I am in Japan"""". Other K-Dramas released in subsequent years, such as ""Full House"" and ""Dae Jang Geum"", also saw comparable levels of success. Since 2002, television programming trends in Southeast Asia began to undergo a drastic change as TV series from South Korea and Taiwan filled the slot originally reserved for Hollywood movies during prime time. Although dramas from South Korea gradually overtook those from Taiwan, much of Asia still had their eyes focused on Taiwanese bands such as F4, S.H.E and Fahrenheit. The breakthrough for K-pop came with the debut of TVXQ, SS501 and Super Junior, the latter hailed by the BBC as a household name in the region. Meanwhile, the popularity of Korean TV dramas continued to spread across the Asian continent, with many Korean male actors portrayed as sweet, romantic, sensitive but also ""totally ripped"" and good looking. Reports about Asian women travelling to South Korea to ""find a Korean husband"" began to appear in the media, including a ""Washington Post"" article about thousands of ""smitten"" Japanese women settling for ""nothing less than a Seoul-mate"", a ""TIME"" magazine article reporting that teenagers from Tokyo to Taipei were swooning over South Korean music artists, and a CNN article about thousands of Chinese women clamoring for a chance to see K-pop boyband Super Junior, resulting in a stampede. By the late 2000s, many Taiwanese music acts could no longer catch up with their K-pop counterparts. Although a number of Taiwanese bands such as F4 and Fahrenheit continued to retain a small but loyal fan base in Asia, teenagers and young adults from all over the world were much more receptive to K-pop bands such as Big Bang and Super Junior, both of whom have managed to attract a huge number of fans from South America, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and to a smaller extent, the Western world (particularly among immigrants with an Asian, Middle Easten, African, or Eastern European background). 2009-10: First forays outside of Asia. Fuelled by the increased global interest in K-pop songs, several K-pop singers decided to expand their music careers by releasing English language-studio albums in the hope of reaching out to Western music markets. However, such attempts did not succeed. Even more glaringly, the K-pop singers BoA and Se7en both returned to South Korea after their U.S. music careers struggled to gain traction. This prompted a freelance journalist writing for CNN to label them as ""complete flops"". In the United States, the spread of Korean pop culture remained confined to immigrant hubs where large numbers of Korean Americans reside, such as Los Angeles and New York City. According to the chief operating officer of Mnet Media, its employees' attempt to pitch over 300 K-pop music videos to American music producers and record labels was met with a lukewarm response, as ""there were relationships so they would be courteous, but it was not a serious conversation"". A music executive from Universal Music Group pointed out that K-pop is unlikely to succeed in the United States because music fans ""would just be too critical about the lyrics and the acts' accents when singing in English."" However, the spread of the ""Hallyu""-wave continued to reach countries outside North America. The TV series ""Jumong"" turned out to be particularly well received by audiences in the Muslim world, attaining over 80 percent viewership ratings in Iran. In Eastern Europe, the initial spread of ""Hallyu"" was also driven by TV series and dramas, with one screening of ""Jumong"" attracting over 800,000 viewers from Romania. Other TV series aired by Romanian Television (the country's state-owned broadcaster) also consistently drew more than 500,000 viewers per episode. In the Indian state of Manipur where Bollywood movies were banned by separatists, consumers gradually turned their attention to Korean entertainment products. According to Agence France-Presse, it is common for Korean language phrases such as ""사랑해요"", or sarang-haeyo (I love you), and ""안녕하세요"", or ""annyeong-haseyo"" (Hello), to be heard in everyday conversations in the schoolyards and street markets of Manipur. Many Korean dramas and films were smuggled into Manipur from neighbouring Burma, in the form of CDs and DVDs. Over in the West, the spread of the ""Hallyu""-wave caught on after the widespread proliferation of social media networks had found its place in everyday life. This gave a huge push to the K-pop genre as the traditional reluctance of radio DJs to broadcast foreign language songs became irrelevant because the video sharing platform YouTube offered young consumers a convenient outlet to listen to any genre of music in any language they wished. As a CNN reporter who attended KCON 2012 in Irvine, California, pointed out: ""If you stop anyone here and ask them how they found out about K-pop, they found it out on YouTube."" 2011-present: ""Hallyu"" goes global. By the end of 2011, the total number of YouTube views generated by K-pop videos had surpassed the 1 billion mark, tripling from 800 million in the previous year to more than 2.3 billion while spurred on by huge growths in Europe and the Middle East. The globalization of ""Hallyu"" was accompanied by the following events: In February 2013, Peru's vice president Marisol Espinoza gave an interview with South Korea's Yonhap News Agency where she named K-pop as ""one of the main factors that made Peruvian people wanting to get to know South Korea more"". She also ""welcomed"" the ""Hallyu""-wave to Peru. In Turkey, the total number of members registered by K-pop fan clubs across the country is estimated to have surpassed 100,000 for the first time, with one particular fanclub drawing almost 13,000 fans. According to a KBS reporter, a handful of Korean dramas were recently aired by four of Uzbekistan's state run TV channels on a daily basis. Over in the West, the number of ""Hallyu"" fans in France has also surpassed 100,000. This is partly due to the demographic structure of France which comprises a significant number of immigrants from North Africa and other parts of the Middle East. In the United States, the popularity of Korean pop culture is currently spreading from the Asian American minority group to larger ethnic groups such as White Americans and African Americans. On February 6, 2013, White House officials managing Michelle Obama's Twitter account revealed that they had gathered Napa cabbage from the South Lawn to """"make kimchi in the kitchen."""" As an editor of ""Esquire"" magazine pointed out, this was considered perplexing because it ""skews so far from the White House's usual fare"". This came shortly after sales of Korean cuisine at the British supermarket chain Tesco more than doubled, while Germany's nationwide public broadcaster Deutschlandradio acknowledged that ""Hallyu"" is ""conquering the world"", France's largest television network TF1 reported that the K-pop ""phenomenon"" is breaking out into the entire youth demographic, and the British Minister of State from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Hugo Swire, affirmed in a meeting with South Korean diplomats that Korean music has gone global. Back in Asia, the ""Hallyu""-wave reached new heights as Myanmar's democracy icon and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, made her first visit to South Korea in 2013 for, among others, a ""special dinner"" with some of the most popular Korean actors including Ahn Jae-wook, the male protagonist of the 1997 Korean drama ""Star in My Heart"". According to an article by Agence France-Presse, """"Star in My Heart"""" was a big hit in Suu Kyi's homeland and its male protagonist Ahn Jae-wook was personally invited for a dinner with Aung San Suu Kyi because of his ""resemblance to her assassinated father (Aung San)"". In 2013, researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem reported that young people in Israel are beginning to see K-pop as ""cultural capital"" - something which makes them stand out from the crowd. It is hoped that the ""Korean Wave"" will bring together fans from both Israel and the Palestinian Territories, where the number of K-pop followers was reported to have surpassed 3,000. On February 25, 2013, South Korea's newly elected president Park Geun-hye delivered her inauguration speech where she promised to build a nation that ""becomes happier through culture"", and to foster a ""new cultural renaissance"" that will transcend ethnicity and overcome ideologies because of its ""ability to share happiness"". According to ""The Korea Times"", one of Park Geun-hye's main priorities as president will be to allocate at least 2 percent of the national budget to further develop South Korea's cultural industry and to seek more cultural exchanges with North Korea. However, a state survey of 3,600 respondents from Brazil, China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, France, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom indicated that ""Hallyu"" faces an uncertain future as over 66 percent of respondents believe that the popularity of Korean culture will ""subside in the next four years"". Characteristics of ""Hallyu"" and role of the South Korean government. One important characteristic of the ""Korean Wave"" is the use of cultural technology to suit the tastes of overseas audiences, as well as the use of social media to reach a wider audience. The popularity of K-pop music videos has been aided by crowdsourcing translation sites such as Viki, whose Creative Commons license translations help bridge language barriers. The Government of South Korea considers the ""Korean Wave"" to be a viable way to increase the total exports of the country. In 2013, the Export-Import Bank of Korea announced its decision to provide loans and credit guarantees worth US$917 million to entertainment and food firms over the next three years to promote the spread of the ""Korean Wave"". A spokesman representing the bank told reporters that K-pop, Korean dramas, as well as traditional Korean cuisine have huge growth potential, and that exporters of such cultural content deserve more investment and financial support. Worldwide image surveys. On July 28, 2013, the South Korean government announced that it plans to conduct a worldwide public image survey of Korea targeting citizens of several major countries. The aim of the survey is to collect preliminary data in line with the state’s goal of creating an “""attractive Korea trusted by the world""”. The results of the survey are due to be published in October 2013 and will involve 1,000 citizens from each foreign country. A few more rounds of such surveys involving 20 countries per year will also be held in 2014 and 2015. Census of ""Hallyu"" fans. According to a 2011 survey conducted by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the total number of active members registered by ""Hallyu"" fan clubs worldwide is estimated to have surpassed 3 million for the first time. These figures are based on statistics published by official fan clubs in countries and regions where the Korean Cultural Center has been established. In addition, there are also 200 fan clubs devoted to ""Hallyu"" in Japan, but most of these organizations were excluded from the 2011 state-sponsored survey as they have been operating solely for commercial purposes. Also in the same year, the Korea Tourism Organization surveyed 12,085 fans of ""Hallyu"" and concluded that: ""Hallyu"" and international diplomacy. Besides increasing the amount of exports, the ""Korean Wave"" is used by the government as a soft power tool to engage with the masses of young people all over the world, and to reduce anti-Korean sentiment. Since 2011, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been inviting K-pop fan communities from all over the world to take part in auditions held at the embassies of South Korea. After going through a few preliminary rounds, those selected by the jury will be sponsored a free trip to South Korea to compete in the annual K-Pop World Festival organized by the government. In May 2012, the government held a K-pop showcase concert as part of its """"Hallyu Diplomacy"""". East Asia. China. In 2005, the former Chinese President Hu Jintao remarked that it is a ""shame"" that his busy schedule had stopped him from watching every episode of the Korean TV series ""Dae Jang Geum"". According to ""Asia Times Online"", ""Dae Jang Geum"" was first aired by China's state-run Hunan Broadcasting System a few months back and attracted over 180 million viewers from all over the country. Two years later, the former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was quoted by China's official Xinhua News Agency as saying: ""Regarding the ""Hallyu"" phenomenon, the Chinese people, especially the youth, are particularly attracted to it and the Chinese government considers the ""Hallyu"" phenomenon to be a vital contribution towards mutual cultural exchanges flowing between China and South Korea."" In August 2008, the lead actress of the Korean TV series ""Dae Jang Geum"", Lee Young-ae, was invited to attend a state dinner with the presidents of China (Hu Jintao) and South Korea (Lee Myung-bak). In 2012, Psy reached Number 1 on China's Baidu 500 download list with his hit single ""Gangnam Style"", which was labelled by Chinese netizens and state media as a ""divine melody"" (viral song). Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledges that the ""boom"" in Korean popular culture in Japan has ""expanded"" mutual interest and cultural exchanges between both countries. Several high-profile fans of Korean TV dramas include Japan's former first lady Miyuki Hatoyama and Japan's current first lady Akie Abe. However, the popularity of Korean entertainment exports has recently led to several instances of street protests and demonstrations involving hundreds of people. These protests were mostly organized by critics of Korean pop culture with the support of right-wing nationalists. The Middle East. According to the ""Saudi Gazette"", both Egypt and Iran have become major destinations of the ""Hallyu""-wave since the mid-2000s. Following the success of several Korean dramas, the Korean Overseas Information Service donated """"Winter Sonata"""" (a popular Korean TV series) to several state-run Egyptian television networks and also paid an undisclosed fee for Arabic subtitles. ""The New York Times"" published an article stating that the intended goal was to ""generate positive feelings"" among Arab audiences towards South Korean soldiers stationed in northern Iraq. Egypt. ""Autumn in My Heart"", one of the earliest Korean dramas brought over to the Middle East, was made available for viewing after the South Korean embassy successfully persuaded an Egyptian state-run broadcasting company to air Korean TV series following five months of ""persistent negotiations"". Shortly after the final episode ended, the embassy reported that it had received over 400 phone calls and love letters from fans from all over the country. According to Lee Ki-seok, secretary of the South Korean embassy in Cairo, South Korea's involvement in the Iraq War had significantly undermined its reputation among ordinary Egyptians but the Korean drama ""Autumn in My Heart"" proved ""extremely effective"" in reversing this trend. Iran. In October 2012, the ""Tehran Times"" reported that several representatives from Iran's state broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), have arrived in South Korea to visit the original filming locations of several Korean TV series including ""Jumong"" and ""Dong Yi"", both of which have attained widespread popularity in Iran. These TV series were previously aired by IRIB TV3, one of Iran's state-run television channels. According to the IRIB World Service (the official external broadcasting network of Iran), the meeting was intended to strengthen the ""cultural affinities"" between the two countries and to seek avenues for further cooperation between the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and the IRIB. The main factor contributing to the IRIB's decision to air Korean TV series during prime time is often attributed to the lead protagonists' tendency to reinforce traditional Confucian values that are closely aligned with those of Islam, such as putting society before oneself and showing respect towards higher authorities. Consequently, Korean dramas are seen as a substitute for Western film productions, many of which do not satisfy the criteria set by Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance and are therefore censored by Iranian law enforcers. According to Reuters, until recently audiences in Iran have had little choice but to watch what the state broadcaster deemed was suitable. As a result, Korean dramas aired by Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting receive little competition from foreign film productions, and more often than not, attain higher viewership ratings in Iran than in South Korea. For example, some of the most popular episodes of ""Jumong"" attracted over 90% of all audiences in Iran (compared to 40% in South Korea), propelling the rise of its lead actor, Song Il-gook, to superstar status in Iran. In 2008, the National Museum of Korea organized an exhibition touted as """"The Glory of Persia"""". In an interview with Iran's state-run media, Choe Kwang-shik (South Korea's former Minister of Culture) hailed the exhibition as one of the ""most important cultural events"" and expressed hope that it would ""introduce the Iranian history, culture and civilization to the Korean people"". According to Iran's state-run media, the exhibition was attended by over 350,000 people, and the number of South Korean tourists visiting Iran had quadrupled as a result of the exhibition. More recently, researchers from both countries have been studying the cultural exchanges between Silla (one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea) and the Persian Empire (modern-day Iran). A journalist from ""The Korea Times"" quoted an Iranian scholar suggesting that the cultures of Silla and Perisa may have ""naturally blended each other 1,200 years ago."". Iraq. In 2012, the Korean drama ""Hur Jun"" was reported to have attained over 90% viewership ratings in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. According to South Korean media, its lead actor, Jun Kwang-ryul, was invited by the federal government of Iraq to visit the city of Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan at the special request of the country's First Lady, Hero Ibrahim Ahmed. Back in the early 2000s, Korean dramas were originally aired for South Korean troops stationed in northern Iraq as part of coalition forces led by the United States during the Iraq War. With the end of the war and the subsequent withdrawal of South Korean military personnel from the country, there were efforts made to expand the availability of K-dramas to the ordinary citizens of Iraq. According to the South Korean embassy in Baghdad, plans have been made for the K-dramas ""Dae Jang Geum"" and ""Winter Sonata"" to be aired by Iraq's state-owned Al Iraqiya television network following the Ramadan festival in the latter half of 2012. Turkey. In February 2012, Jaejoong (a band member of K-pop idol group JYJ) was invited by the South Korean Embassy in Ankara to hold an autograph signing session for hundreds of K-pop fans at Ankara University. Before departing for K-pop concerts in South America, Jaejoong also attended a state banquet with the presidents of South Korea (Lee Myung Bak) and Turkey (Abdullah Gül). Oceania. Australia. In March 2012, Australia's then Prime Minister Julia Gillard visited South Korea's Yonsei University, where she acknowledged that her country has ""caught"" the ""Korean Wave"" that is ""reaching all the way to our shores"". New Zealand. In November 2012, New Zealand's Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andrea Smith, delivered a key note address to South Korean diplomats at the University of Auckland, where she asserted that the ""Korean Wave"" is becoming ""part of the Kiwi lifestyle"" and added that ""there is now a 4,000 strong association of K-Pop followers in New Zealand."" Eastern Europe. Belarus. Marking the 20th anniversary of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Belarus, the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the National State Television and Radio Company will air a handful of Korean television programs from February 13 to 17 as part of its so-called ""diplomatic broadcasting"" with South Korea's Arirang TV. The ministry also added that extra attention will be given to K-pop concerts that are ""becoming extremely popular all over the world."" In return, South Korea's Arirang TV will broadcast Belarusian films several times a day during the same period. Romania. According to a local daily newspaper, the first Korean drama was aired on Romanian Television in August 2009 and in the following month, it became the 3rd most popular television program in Romania. By 2010, many other Korean dramas were also aired on national television channels such as TVR1 and TVR1, with some of them attaining the highest TV Ratings among all prime time shows. As a result, the state-run Romanian Television network has further extended its purchase of Korean TV dramas. Western Europe. France. The French Foreign Ministry acknowledges the status of ""Hallyu"" as a global phenomenon that is characterized by the ""growing worldwide success of Korean popular culture"". Germany. The German Foreign Office has confirmed that ""Korean entertainment (""Hallyu"", Telenovelas, K-Pop bands, etc) is currently enjoying great popularity and success in Asia and beyond."" United Kingdom. In November 2012, the British Minister of State for the Foreign Office, Hugo Swire, held a meeting with South Korean diplomats at the House of Lords, where he affirmed that Korean music has gone ""global"". United States. During a bilateral meeting with South Korea's president Park Geun-Hye at the White House in May 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama cited Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" as an example of how people around the world are being ""swept up by Korean culture -- the ""Korean Wave""."" In August 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also affirmed that the ""Korean Wave"" ""spreads Korean culture to countries near and far."" United Nations. On October 30, 2012, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a speech in front of the National Assembly of South Korea where he noted how Korean culture and the ""Hallyu-wave"" is ""making its mark on the world"". Effects. Political. National prestige. In 2012, the BBC's country rating poll revealed that public opinion of South Korea has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as Russia, India, China and France, public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea. This comes alongside a rapid surge in cultural exports which was worth a total of US$4.2 billion in 2011. The following data is based on government statistics for the value of cultural exports while the country's rank in global soft power is based on a study by the international affairs magazine """"Monocle"""": Korean conflict. Roh Moo-hyun, the ninth President of South Korea, was among the first to acknowledge the use of the ""Hallyu""-wave as a tool to reunify the Korean Peninsula. In May 2007, the TV series ""Hwang Jini"" (which is adapted from a novel by a North Korean author) became the first South Korean film production to be made available for public viewing in North Korea. With the end of Roh Moo-hyun administration's Sunshine Policy towards North Korea and a deterioration of North-South relations, however, the spread of the ""Hallyu""-wave was quickly restrained by North Korean authorities, although a report published by Radio Free Asia (a non-profit radio network funded by the U.S. federal government) indicated that the ""Korean Wave"" ""may already have taken a strong hold in the isolated Stalinist state"". In 2010, researchers from the Korea Institute for National Unification surveyed 33 North Korean defectors and found out that the impact of Korean dramas such as """"Winter Sonata"""" had played a significant role in shaping the decision of North Korean defectors to flee to the South. It was further revealed that a small number of people living close to the Korean Demilitarized Zone have been tampering with their televisions sets in order to receive signals from South Korean broadcast stations in the vicinity, while CDs and DVDs smuggled across the border with China also increased the reach of South Korean popular culture in the North. The survey was repeated in 2012, this time with a much larger group of North Korean defectors (100 in total). According to one of the researchers, some of North Korea's financial elite have been watching South Korean videos either on a daily basis, or at least once a week. The survey also affirmed a widely held belief that North Koreans living close to the border with China have the highest degree of access to South Korean entertainment as compared to other areas. In October 2012, the Supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, gave a speech at the headquarters of the internal security division of the Korean People's Army, where he vowed to ""extend the fight against the enemy's ideological and cultural infiltration"". Earlier on, a study conducted by an international consulting group, commissioned by the U.S. State Department, came to the conclusion that the country is ""increasingly anxious"" to keep the flow of information at bay but has less ability to control it as there is ""substantial demand"" for movies and television programs from the South as well as many ""intensely"" entrepreneurial smugglers from the Chinese side of the border willing to fulfill that demand. In February 2013, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a human rights group saying that Psy's 2012 international hit single ""Gangnam Style"" has ""deeply permeated North Korea"", after the mission group had been actively sending out K-pop CDs and other goods across the China–North Korea border. On May 15, 2013, the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch confirmed that ""entertainment shows from South Korea are particularly popular and have served to undermine the North Korean government’s negative portrayals of South Korea"". Economic. According to a 2006 Washington Post article, the increased popularity of South Korean entertainment has led to increased sales of other aspects of South Korean culture including food, clothing, video games, and Korean language classes. The following data is from the Korea Creative Contents Agency, a body that is a part of the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of the Republic of Korea, and is from the first quarter of 2012 fiscal year. All monetary values represent South Korean won. Backlash. There have been many cultural backlashes in places where the ""Hallyu""-wave has spread, as is the case in countries such as Japan, China, and Taiwan. Existing anti-Korean attitudes may be rooted in historical hatreds and ethnic nationalism. In Japan, an anti-Korean comic book, ""Manga Kenkanryu"" or ""Hating the Korean Wave"" was released in July 26, 2005, which became a #1 bestseller on Amazon.co.jp. Japanese actor Sousuke Takaoka openly showed his dislike for the Korean wave on his Twitter, which triggered an internet movement to boycott Korean programming on Japanese television on the 8th of August. On February 1, 2012, Al Jazeera revealed ""punishing schedules and contracts, links to prostitution and corruption"" in the industry. Anti-Korean attitude also spiked when Kim Tae-Hee, a Korean actress, was selected to be on a Japanese TV soap opera in 2011. Since she was an activist in the Liancourt Rocks dispute for the Dokdo movement in Korea, some Japanese people were enraged that she would be on the Japanese TV show. There was a protest against Kim Tae-Hee in Japan, which later turned into a protest against the ""Korean Wave"". As the ""Hallyu-wave"" arrives in the West, there is concern that South Korea could tap into the ""Hallyu""-wave to achieve its political goals. In a satirical speech recorded by a local radio station, the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, joked that the world might end due to the ""total triumph of K-Pop"". Others have also noted similarities between the South Korean Ministry of Culture's support of the ""Korean Wave"" and the CIA's involvement in the Cultural Cold War with the former Soviet Union. According to ""The Quietus"" magazine, suspicion of ""Hallyu"" sponsored by the South Korean government to strengthen its political influence bears a whiff of the ""old Victorian fear of Yellow Peril"" that many Westerners in the late nineteenth century feared would eventually take over and destroy Western civilization and its culture. Interpretation and contrast with imperialism. South Korea's Ambassador to Peru, Park Hee-kwon, acknowledges that the government's policy of cultural diplomacy should place a greater emphasis on two-way communication by encouraging mutual exchanges with foreign nations, thus avoiding a unidirectional flow of culture. This view is also shared by South Korea's former Minister of Culture, Choe Kwang-shik. Dr. of the University of Tokyo interprets the ""Korean Wave"" as ""an Asian attempt to acculturate Asia from American culture with the help from Korean dramas and songs"". According to an article published by the international relations magazine ""Foreign Policy"", the spread of Korean popular culture across Southeast Asia, South America, and parts of the Middle East is illustrating how the gradual cessation of European colonialism is giving way and making room for unexpected soft power outside the West. The ""Korean Wave"" is often compared to the European colonization wave while the spread of Korean culture is sometimes referred to as a ""cultural invasion"". The following table lists the similarities and differences between the two: See also. Contrast: Other cultural waves: "

Depleted uranium Liner to enhance penetration of advanced composite armours like Chobham. 3VBK21/3BK25. Entered service estimated 1985. 3VBK25/3BK29. Entered service estimated 1988.  An experimental HEAT round that is obviously in close relationship with 3BK29 was displayed on VTTV-97 exhibition in Omsk. Its cutaway shows a very complex and ingenious design, including shaped-charge precursor, the channel through the middle charge to allow passage of the rear jet and so on. The round is credited with 800mm RHA penetration which was illustrated by a picture of a 800mm penetration route. The picture shows that designers probably deliberately misaligned the charges so that the middle jet doesn't need to penetrate the core of the rear one. If the color of the liner is the same as that on the real round, it indicates that it is not copper, and therefore may have a significantly improved performance against ceramic armors. 3VBK27?/3BK29M. First seen publicly in 1998. Reportedly a triple charge warhead. HE-FRAG-FS. High Explosive Fragmentation Fin Stabilised. General purpose rounds, for use against infantry, bunkers and light vehicles and other 'soft' targets. 3VOF22/3OF19. Entered service in 1962. Uses the 3V-21 detonator (mass = 0.431 kg, reliability = 0.98). The 90% lethal zone for infantry is reported to be 40 m wide and 20 m deep. 3VOF36/3OF26. Entered service in 1970. Uses the 3V-21 detonator (mass = 0.431 kg, reliability = 0.98). The projectile creates between 600 and 2,000 fragments. ATGW/ATGM. 9M112 Kobra.

wikipedia-2265844," People's Republic of Korea  The People's Republic of Korea (PRK) was a short-lived provisional government that was organized with the aim to take over control of Korea shortly after the Surrender of the Empire of Japan at the end of World War II. It operated as a government from late August to early September 1945 until the United States Army Military Government in Korea was established in the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula by the United States of America. After that it operated unofficially, and in opposition to the United States Military Government, until it was forcibly dissolved in January 1946. History. Establishment. The Japanese colonial authorities requested that a government be established to ensure the safety of their persons and property after the occupation ended. Under the leadership of Yeo Un-hyeong, the newly-formed Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence (CPKI) organized people's committees throughout the country to coordinate the transition to independence. On August 28, 1945 the CPKI announced that it would function as the temporary national government of Korea. On September 12, CPKI activists met in Seoul and established the PRK. Program. The program of the PRK was presented in its September 14 twenty-seven point program. The program included: ""the confiscation without compensation of lands held by the Japanese and collaborators; free distribution of that land to the peasants; rent limits on the nonredistributed land; nationalization of such major industries as mining, transportation, banking, and communication; state supervision of small and mid-sized companies; …guaranteed basic human rights and freedoms, including those of speech, press, assembly, and faith; universal suffrage to adults over the age of eighteen; equality for women; labor law reforms including an eight-hour day, a minimum wage, and prohibition of child labor; and ""establishment of close relations with the United States, USSR, England, and China, and positive opposition to any foreign influences interfering with the domestic affairs of the state."" Development in the North. North of the 38th parallel north, the PRK's local structure was maintained under Soviet occupation to become the basis of the modern North Korean party structure (see the origins of the Worker’s Party of Korea). Development in the South. Shortly after the American landing in September 1945, the new United States Army Military Government in Korea, which controlled the peninsula south of the 38th parallel, abolished the PRK government by military decree, primarily because of suspicions that it was Communist. Some local units of the People's Republic remained active in the Jeolla region and especially on Jeju Island, where their presence, together with marauding anti-communist youth gangs, contributed to tensions that discharged in the events known as Jeju massacre. Country-wide developments. Early November saw the creation of the National Council of Korean Labor Unions (NCKLU) and its endorsement of PRK and its program. December saw the creation of the National League of Peasant Unions, the Korean Democratic Youth League, and the Women's League, and their support of the PRK. "

wikipedia-2265969," Quit-rent  Quit rent, Quit-rent, or quitrent, in practically all cases, is now effectively but not formally a tax or land tax imposed on freehold or leased land by a higher landowning authority, usually a government or its assigns. Under feudal law, the payment of quit rent (Latin ""Quietus Redditus"", pl. ""Reditus Quieti"") freed the tenant of a holding from the obligation to perform such other services as were obligatory under feudal tenure, or freed the occupier of the land from the burden of having others use their own distinct rights that affected the land (e.g., hunting rights which would have impaired farming). As such, it was a rental of distinct things that were not parcelled up in the ownership of the land itself, although connected with the full enjoyment of the land, and formally it was a sort of buy back rather than a tax. Where a true tax can be varied by the taxer, and must be paid on pain of penalties that can be varied by the taxer without formal limit, the only sanction for not paying a feudal quit rent was that the alternative burdens would return — which imposed a ceiling on how much could be demanded in payment of a quit rent in practice. Where the sanctions for non-compliance are limited in this way, a quit rent is a rent in fact as well as in form and name, and not a tax; where they are not so limited, a quit rent is not a rent in fact but only in form and name, being rather a tax in fact. The latter is the usual case today, as the former was in earlier times. In post-feudal times, quit rents have continued to be imposed by some governments, usually attached to land grants as a form of land tax.  The quit rent system was used frequently by colonial governments in the British Empire. Many land grants in colonial America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries carried quit rent. Quit rents went on to be used in British colonies, protectorates, etc. in Asia and elsewhere in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Examples: Some governments have now abolished the quit rent system and relieved those with a nominal quit rent obligation from the requirement to pay it, replacing quit rents with a uniform system of land tax. However, in other countries, such as Malaysia, quit rent remains an important means of raising revenue from landowners. References. Also quitrent,one word. (See ""Black's Law Dictionary"".) "

wikipedia-2266055," Emil Brunner  Heinrich Emil Brunner (born December 23, 1889 in Winterthur, Switzerland; died April 6, 1966 in Zurich, Switzerland) was a Swiss Protestant (Reformed) theologian. Along with Karl Barthsee Relationship with Karl Barth belowhe is commonly associated with neo-orthodoxy or the dialectical theology movement. Biography. Emil Brunner was born in Winterthur, near Zurich, Switzerland.  He studied at the universities of Zurich and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in theology from Zurich in 1913, with a dissertation on ""The Symbolic Element in Religious Knowledge."" Brunner served as pastor from 1916 to 1924 in the mountain village of Obstalden in the Swiss Canton of Glarus. In 1919–1920 he spent a year in the United States studying at Union Theological Seminary in New York.  In 1921, Brunner published his ""Habilitationsschrift"" (a post-doctoral dissertation traditionally required in many countries in order to attain the position of a fully tenured professor) on ""Experience, Knowledge and Faith"" and in 1922 was appointed a ""Privatdozent"" at the University of Zurich. Soon after, another book followed: ""Mysticism and the Word"" (1924), which was a devastating critique of the liberal theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher. Brunner was rewarded for his literary efforts with his appointment in 1924 as Professor of Systematic and Practical Theology at the University of Zurich, a post which he held until his retirement in 1953. Following this appointment Brunner's reputation as a theologian continued to increase, particularly after the publication of two further important works in 1927, the first being ""The Philosophy of Religion from the Standpoint of Protestant Theology"" and second ""The Mediator"". After accepting various invitations to deliver lectures across Europe and the United States, in 1930 Brunner published ""God and Man "" and in 1932 ""The Divine Imperative."" Brunner continued his theological output with ""Man in Revolt"" and ""Truth as Encounter"" in 1937. In the same year he was a substantial contributor to the World Conference on Church, Community, and State in Oxford, a position which was reflected in his continued involvement in the ecumenical movement. In 1937–1938 he returned to the United States for a year as a visiting professor at Princeton Theological Seminary.  Brunner's ecclesiastical positions varied at differing points in his career. Before the outbreak of the war Brunner returned to Europe with the young Scottish theologian Thomas Torrance who had studied under Karl Barth in Basel and who had been teaching at Auburn Theological Seminary, New York (and who would subsequently go on to distinguish himself as a professor at the University of Edinburgh). Following the war, Brunner delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, Scotland in 1946–1947 on ""Christianity and Civilisation."" In 1953 he retired from his post at the University of Zurich and took up a position of Visiting Professor at the recently founded International Christian University in Tokyo, Japan (1953–1955), but not before the publication of the first two volumes of his three volume magnum opus ""Dogmatics"" (volume one: ""The Christian Doctrine of God"" (1946), volume two: ""The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption"" (1950), and volume three: ""The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and Consummation"" (1960)). While returning to Europe from Japan, Brunner suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and was physically impaired, weakening his ability to work. Though there were times when his condition would improve, he suffered further strokes, finally succumbing to death in 1966. Brunner holds a place of prominence in Protestant theology in the 20th century and was one of the four or five leading systematicians. Theology. Brunner rejected liberal theology's portrait of Jesus as merely a highly-respected human being. Instead, Brunner insisted that Jesus was God incarnate and central to salvation.  Some claim that Brunner also attempted to find a middle position within the ongoing Arminian and Calvinist debate, stating that Christ stood between God's sovereign approach to humankind and free human acceptance of God's gift of salvation. However, Brunner was a Protestant theologian from German-speaking Europe (a heritage which did not lay nearly as much weight on the Calvinist-Arminian controversy as Dutch- or English-speaking theology). Thus, it may be more accurate to describe his viewpoint as a melding together of Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of soteriology; the Lutheran accent in particular was dominant in Brunner's affirmation of single predestination over against both the double predestination of Calvin and the liberal insistence on universal salvation, a view he charged Barth with holding.  In any event, Brunner and his compatriots in the neo-orthodox movement rejected ""in toto"" Pelagian concepts of human cooperation with God in the act of salvation, which were prominent in other humanist conceptions of Christianity in the late 19th century. Instead, they embraced Augustine's views, especially as refracted through Martin Luther. Although Brunner re-emphasized the centrality of Christ, evangelical and fundamentalist theologians, mainly those from America and Great Britain, have usually rejected Brunner's other teachings, including his dismissal of certain miraculous elements within the Scriptures and his questioning of the usefulness of the doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible. This is in accord with the treatment that conservatives have afforded others in the movement such as Barth and Paul Tillich; most conservatives have viewed neo-orthodox theology as simply a more moderate form of liberalism, rejecting its claims as a legitimate expression of the Protestant tradition. Relationship with Karl Barth. Brunner was considered to be the chief proponent of the new theology long before Barth's name was known in America, as his books had been translated into English much earlier. He has been considered by many to be the minor partner in the uneasy relationship. Brunner once acknowledged that the only theological genius of the 20th century was Barth. "
wikipedia-2266087," Bramall Hall  Bramall Hall is a Tudor manor house in Bramhall, within the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is a timber-framed building, the oldest parts of which date from the 14th century, with later additions from the 16th and 19th centuries. The house, which functions as a museum, and its of landscaped parkland with lakes, woodland, and gardens are open to the public.  Dating back to Anglo-Saxon England, the manor of Bramall was first described in the ""Domesday Book"" in 1086, when it was held by the Masseys. From the late 14th century it was owned by the Davenports who built the present house, and remained lords of the manor for about 500 years before selling the estate of nearly 2,000 acres in 1877 to the Manchester Freeholders' Company, a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estate's potential for residential building development. The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres was sold on by the Freeholders (though not the lordship of the manor) to the Nevill family of successful industrialists. In 1925 it was purchased by John Henry Davies, and then, in 1935, acquired by the local government authority for the area, Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Bramall Hall is now owned by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which describes it as ""the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area"". History. Early history. The name ""Bramall"" means ""nook of land where broom grows"" and is derived from the Old English noun ""brōm"" meaning broom, a type of shrub common in the area, and the Old English noun ""halh"", which has several meanings – including nook, secret place and valley – that could refer to Bramall. The manor of Bramall dates from the Anglo-Saxon period, when it was held as two separate estates owned by the Anglo-Saxon freemen Brun and Hacun. The manor was devastated during William the Conqueror's Harrying of the North. After William subdued the north-west of England, the land was divided among his followers and Bramall was given to Hamon de Massey in around 1070.  The earliest reference to Bramhall was recorded in the ""Domesday Book"" as ""Bramale"" at which time the manor was part of the Hamestan Hundred in Cheshire. With Cheadle and Norbury, Bramall was one of three places described in the ""Domesday Book"" that today lie within the modern-day Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. Whereas its value was 32 shillings before 1066, it was worth only 5 shillings by 1086.  In the first part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a follower of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed. Early Davenports. The Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north-west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the Norman conquest. Orm de Davenport lived close to what is now Marton, and his name derives from the Norman French ""Dauen-port"" meaning ""the town on the trickling stream"", referring to his home on the River Dane. In 1160, the family became responsible for Macclesfield Forest, and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant. The family's coat of arms includes a man's head with a rope around the neck, which is said to represent the family's power over life and death during this period. The Davenports acquired land throughout the area, notably at Wheltrough, Henbury, Woodford and lastly at Bramhall through marriage. The Davenports held the manor for around 500 years, and it is likely that after their accession they built the current house. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, and one of the first recorded trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building. The third William Davenport, who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541, took part in what later became known as The Rough Wooing, a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by Henry VIII. He was knighted in Scotland for his efforts at the burning of Edinburgh in May 1544. The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name, and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years. The first marriage in Bramall's chapel was recorded in 1599, between William (aged 15), eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy, and Frances Wilbraham (aged 11). On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by James I at Newark (where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London) and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield. During the tenure of the fifth William, many alterations were made to the building, including the addition of a room above the Great Hall (which would later become the Withdrawing Room), and a long gallery. The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits. The sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the English Civil War broke out. He was a Royalist, though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one. Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers, and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers, mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war, and using the house for quartering soldiers. Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers, who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war. William Davenport was at one point charged with delinquency, and ordered to pay a fine of £750 (equivalent to £ as of ), and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience. Later Davenports. The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter, who was followed by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria. Humphreys, a Naval captain, had married Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton. Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was rented out to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall. Later history. John Davenport returned to Bramall in 1876 at the age of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned, while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a Manchester property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £ as of ). According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing, for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing the coachman and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family. Thomas Nevill, Charles' nephew and adopted son, inherited the estate in 1916, but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after the First World War. In 1923, many items of furniture were auctioned off, but there was no interest in purchase of the house. During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States; this may have been popularised by the autobiography of Kate Douglas Wiggin which described the author's visit to Bramall in 1890. In 1925, the house was auctioned, with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off. At one point the neighbouring local authority, Stockport County Borough Council, offered to buy the estate, but Nevill rejected their offer as ""unacceptable"". The auction received no acceptable offers. However, one of those present, John Henry Davies, president of Manchester United, later offered £15,000 (about £ as of ) for the house; this was accepted. He lived in the house until his death in 1927, and his widow Amy remained there until 1935, when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council for £14,360 (worth about £ as of ) with the intention that the house and park be open to the public. Under council ownership, the house was occupied by a caretaker, though most of the building was open to the public. The house and grounds were used for various functions, such as the proclamation of George VI succeeding his brother King Edward VIII to the throne. At that time, the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture. One of the Council's earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel, which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century. It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall, and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed. In 1947, an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up, primarily to find furnishings for the house, but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds. Over the years, many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned, including portraits of the occupants. The estate is now the property of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which acquired it in 1974, following local government reorganisation. Present day. The house and grounds are open to the public and are run by SMBC. Visitors may take an official tour of the house or wander the grounds freely. Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year, and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era. The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, and has been used as a background for television series and films, including ""Prank Patrol"", ""Cash in the Attic"", ""Coronation Street"" and ""The Last Vampyre"". Although the house and the park are known by the name ""Bramall"", both have been spelled as ""Bramhall"", ""Bramal"" and other variations over the years. The ""Domesday Book"" used the spelling ""Bramale"", which led Charles Nevill to prefer ""Bramall"", a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property and continued by Stockport Council. There remains, however, confusion over spelling, most often with the house being referred to as ""Bramhall"", the name of the village in which Bramall Hall is situated. House. There has been a settlement at Bramall since Saxon times. According to Alfred Burton, who wrote about Bramall in the late 19th century, the house has not always been in the present location, and was originally at Crow Holt Wood. This theory was rejected by another historian, Frederick Moorhouse, who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted. There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory. Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides, which two streams run through. It is a grade I listed building, and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century, with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries. It was originally accessed from the east side – the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream, then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side, reaching the courtyard on the other side. The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard, in the west, because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888. The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building, in the courtyard: the service wing is on the left, the Great Hall is in the centre, and the Banqueting Hall is on the right. Before the 19th century, the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819, because of its being neither required nor in vogue. The house is built with stone foundations, and the main structure is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years. Ground floor. The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall. As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the business of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A long gallery was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows, common throughout the building. William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel ""Rookwood"". He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as "" best specimen of its class ... its class, in our opinion, is the best ... to be met with in Cheshire"". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside. The Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall. Its walls are panelled with oak, and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era. The Banqueting Hall, which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west, is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house. Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house, not having been renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls. The Nevills used this room as a billiards room. The Chapel, opposite the Banqueting Hall, was the only place of public worship in Bramhall for many years. Its existence was first recorded in 1541, when it was described in the will of the second William Davenport. It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890, and was restored by the council following their purchase of the property in 1935, and religious services began to be held there again. On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library, showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall. The Ten Commandments are written on the west wall. Underneath the Commandments, an older, pre-Reformation Passion painting, is visible. Such depictions were banned during the Reformation, and whitewashed over. It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings, but very little of this particular painting survives. First floor. The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme ""Ride a cock horse"", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century. North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name ""paradise"" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in a 1882 newspaper as ""a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown"". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports. The northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen, scullery, butler's pantry, dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants' bedrooms in the attic. Grounds. The house is set in around of parkland, only a part of the estate originally attached to the house, which was, at one time, about in extent. The park was used for hunting, and the grounds were home to cattle, deer and horses, until the 17th century, when it was used as agricultural land. Two water courses run through the park: the Ladybrook, which, a little beyond the Park, becomes the Micker Brook, before flowing into the River Mersey, and a stream known as the Carr Brook. In the 1880s, Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste, altering the course of the Ladybrook, adding considerably to the trees in the park and creating artificial ponds The ponds were stocked with trout (though they are no longer fished). In 1888, a new drive was made through the park, a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive, and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces.  The park is open to the public and features woodland, open grass areas, gardens, a café, a bowling green, and children's play areas. "
wikipedia-2266113," Meir Dagan  Aluf Meir Dagan (; born 30 January 1945) is a former Israel Defense Forces officer and former Director of the Mossad. Biography. Meir Huberman (later Dagan) was born on a train between the Soviet Union and Poland during the Holocaust to Polish Jewish parents who had fled Poland for the Soviet Union. His maternal grandfather Ber Erlich Sloshny, was killed by the Nazis. In 2009, the Israeli newspaper ""Yedioth Ahronoth"" published two photos of Nazi soldiers standing next to a kneeling Sloshny shortly before they shot him. During his term as Director-General of the Mossad, Dagan kept one of the photographs hanging in his office. Meir and his parents survived the Holocaust, and in 1950, the family made aliyah to Israel. During the ship's approach to Israel, it encountered a storm, during which Meir stood on the stern, praying to reach the shore safely. The family initially lived in an immigrant camp in Lod before settling in Bat Yam, where Meir grew up and his parents ran a laundry business. Dagan is a vegetarian and an amateur painter, who studied painting and sculpture at Tel Aviv University. He is married with three children. Military and intelligence career. Dagan was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1963. He was considered for the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, but ended up joining the Paratroopers Brigade. He completed his compulsory service in 1966, but was called up as a reservist in 1967, and fought in the Six-Day War as an officer, commanding a paratrooper platoon on the Sinai front. In the early 1970s, he commanded an ad hoc undercover commando unit, known as Sayeret Rimon, whose task was to combat the increasing violence in the Palestinian territories. In 1971, he received a Medal of Courage for tackling a wanted terrorist who was holding a live grenade. Dagan later fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War as an officer on the Sinai front, and participated in the crossing of the Suez Canal. During the 1982 Lebanon War, he commanded the Barak Armored Brigade, and was one of the first brigade commanders to enter Beirut. In the 1990s, he held a series of high-level positions in the IDF command, eventually reaching the rank of Major General before retiring from the army in 1995, after 32 years of service. Dagan later served as a counterterrorism adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he initially served as a National Security Adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Sharon appointed him Director-General of Mossad in August 2002, replacing outgoing Director Efraim Halevy. As Mossad director, Dagan was allegedly aggressive in ordering killings of terrorists. According to Mossad veteran Gad Shimron, ""Israel is in the paradoxical situation of not having a death penalty but allowing itself to target Arab terrorists outside its borders with almost complete impunity. Meir Dagan fully subscribes to this thinking, unlike some of his predecessors"". By November 2004, at least four Arab terrorists had already been killed in suspected Mossad operations, and three major terrorist attacks planned against Israeli civilians abroad had been foiled. Ehud Yatom, a member of the Knesset Subcommittee on Secret Services, stated that ""as someone who is privy to the facts but not at liberty to divulge them, I can say this with complete authority. The Mossad under Meir Dagan has undergone a revolution in terms of organization, intelligence and operations."" Under Dagan's watch, Mossad tripled its recruitment efforts, launching a website where people can apply to join. Reportedly, much of its annual budget of $350 million was diverted from traditional intelligence gathering and analysis to field operations and ""special tasks"". Dagan was reconfirmed as Mossad director until the end of 2008 by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in February 2007, and in June 2008, Olmert again extended his tenure until the end of 2009. In mid-2007, Dagan had a ""spat"" with the Deputy Director N, who was thought to be a candidate for replacing Dagan in late 2008. Dagan restored his former deputy T to the post and Dagan was thought likely to recommend T as his replacement. He was re-appointed in 2009 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to serve until the end of 2010. In June 2010, a report from Channel 2 stated that Netanyahu had denied a request by Dagan for another year as Mossad director, though this was quickly denied by the Prime Minister's Office. In November 2010, Tamir Pardo was announced as his replacement.  Following his departure, Dagan made several controversial public statements concerning the prudence of an Israeli military attack on Iran's nuclear facilties. He called it a ""stupid idea"" in a May 2011 conference. After Dagan voiced criticism of the prime minister, he was asked to return his diplomatic passport before its expiration date. Dagan repeated the opinion in a March 2012 interview with Lesley Stahl of CBS News' ""60 Minutes"", calling an Israeli attack of Iran before other options were exhausted ""the stupidest idea"" and saying he considered the Iranians ""a very rational regime."" Business career. As of 2011, Dagan serves as the director of the Israel Port Authority. In 2011 he was also appointed chairman of Gulliver Energy Ltd. (TASE:GLVR), which announced that it intends to mine uranium at a license in the Dead Sea area and drill in search of gold near Eilat. 2012 illness. On October 17, 2012, it was reported that Dagan had been suffering from a previously-undisclosed illness, and had undergone a successful liver transplant in Belarus ten days before. As criteria for a liver transplant in Israel dictates that the patient must be no older than 65, the 67-year-old Dagan had to seek treatment abroad. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman helped facilitate the operation. On October 27, 2012, Dagan returned to Israel and was immediately hospitalized upon his return. He was discharged from Ichilov Hospital and began recuperating. Dagan was accompanied throughout his ordeal by Rabbi Avraham Elimelech Firer, with whom he developed a close relationship, and later reciprocated by helping Firer raise funds for a new rehabilitation center.

wikipedia-2266144," Songs of Freedom  The original release edition was one million individually numbered collectors items Songs of Freedom is a four-disc box set containing music by Bob Marley and the Wailers, from Marley's first song ""Judge Not"" recorded in 1961, to a live version of ""Redemption Song"", recorded in 1980 at his last concert.  The song ""Iron Lion Zion"" was first released on this compilation, in what is often considered the original mix (although the original is said to not have included the harmony vocals from the I-Threes). The single releases (and subsequent compilation releases) use a remix which was created for the single using modern production, which sounds very different. ""Why Should I"" was remixed for this compilation and released as a single. The original wasn't released until the JAD/Universal box set Man To Man in 2004. The original was recorded in 1971 and features Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer's backing vocals, which were replaced by The I-Threes on the remix. It is said to be complimentary to the greatest hits compilation ""Legend"", in the sense that any of the tracks with the same names are presented in different versions from the normal single mixes on ""Legend"" - as an example see the number of 12"" mixes in the track listing below. The exception is the original version of Get Up Stand Up. "
wikipedia-2266146," Cape Doctor  ""Cape Doctor"" (usually The Cape Doctor or ""die Kaapse dokter"" in Afrikaans) is the local name for the strong, persistent and dry south-easterly wind that blows on the South African coast from spring to late summer (September to March in the southern hemisphere). It is known as the Cape Doctor because it has long been held to clear Cape Town of pollution and 'pestilence'. Although the wind smites a wide area of the sub-continent, it is notorious especially in and around the Cape Peninsula, where it can be unpleasantly strong and irritating. The 'Cape Doctor' is to some extent an obsolescent term; many now simply call it the ""South-Easter"". An ironic fact is that the meteorological records for Cape Town show that the north-west winds of winter can be far stronger and more destructive than the South-Easter. Although usually accompanied by fair weather, if the SE wind is accompanied by a cut-off low as occasionally happens in the spring and autumn months, this can cause heavy rains to fall over the Western Cape. This phenomenon is popularly known as a black South-Easter. The Laingsburg flood of 24 and 25 January 1981 is an example of this. "
wikipedia-2266150," Vinorelbine  Vinorelbine (trade name Navelbine) is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is given as a treatment for some types of cancer, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Pharmacology. Vinorelbine is the first 5´NOR semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid. It is obtained by semi-synthesis from alkaloids extracted from the rosy periwinkle, ""Catharanthus roseus"". It is marketed in India by Abbott Healthcare under the brand name Navelbine. History. Vinorelbine was invented by the pharmacist Pierre Potier and his team from the CNRS in France in the 1980s and was licensed to the oncology department of the Pierre Fabre Group. The drug was approved in France in 1989 under the brand name Navelbine for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It gained approval to treat metastatic breast cancer in 1991. Vinorelbine received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1994 sponsored by Burroughs Wellcome Company. Pierre Fabre Group now markets Navelbine in the U.S., where the drug went generic in February 2003. In most European countries, vinorelbine is approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Uses. As stated above, Vinorelbine is approved for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. It is also active in rhabdomyosarcoma. Oral formulation. An oral formulation has been marketed and registered in most European countries for the same settings. It has similar efficacy as the intravenous formulation, avoids venous toxicities of an infusion and is easier to take. Side effects. Vinorelbine has a number of side-effects that can limit its use: Lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, anaemia, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, numbness or tingling in hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy), tiredness and a general feeling of weakness (asthenia), inflammation of the vein into which it was injected (phlebitis). Seldom severe hyponatremia is seen. Less common effects are hair loss and allergic reaction. "
wikipedia-2266155," Telescopic handler  A telescopic handler, or telehandler, is a machine widely used in agriculture and industry. It is similar in appearance and function to a forklift but is more a crane than forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On the end of the boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, muck grab, or winch. In industry the most common attachment for a tele-handler is pallet forks and the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift. For example, telehandlers have the ability to remove palletised cargo from within a trailer and to place loads on rooftops and other high places. The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient. In agriculture the most common attachment for a tele-handler is a bucket or bucket grab, again the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a 'conventional machine' which in this case is a wheeled loader or backhoe loadal. For example, telehandlers have the ability to reach directly into a high-sided trailer or hopper. The latter application would otherwise require a loading ramp, conveyor, or similar. The advantage of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between the front of the wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400lb (225kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often refereed to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a Telehandler and small crane. Telehandlers were pioneered by the Matbro company at Horley in Surrey, England, UK who developed them from their articulated cross country forestry forklifts. At first they had a centrally mounted boom on the front section, with the driver's cab on the rear section, as in the Teleram 40, but the rigid chassis design with a rear mounted boom and cab to the side has become more popular.

wikipedia-2266172," Miss Macao  Miss Macao was a Catalina seaplane owned by Cathay Pacific and operated by a subsidiary. On 16 July 1948 she became the victim of the first hijacking of a commercial aircraft. Piracy for robbery and ransom was the motive. The lone survivor, Huang Yu (, Hanyu Pinyin: ""Huáng Yù"", Cantonese: Wong Yu), was the admitted leader of the hijacking plot, and survived by jumping out the emergency exit just before the crash. He was brought to court by the Macau police, but the Macau court suggested that the prosecution should be brought in Hong Kong instead, since the plane was registered in Hong Kong and most of the passengers were from there. However, the British colonial government in Hong Kong stated that the incident happened over Chinese territory in which the British have no jurisdiction. Since no state claimed authority to try him, Huang was released without trial from Macau prison on June 11, 1951, and was then deported to China (by then the People's Republic of China). "
wikipedia-2266193," SEAT 850  The SEAT 850 was a car launched in 1966, based upon the Fiat 850. Originally only available with the same 2-door sedan body as used in Italy, two different 4-door versions also appeared in 1967. The very rare ""corto"" (short) used the bodywork developed by Francis Lombardi for the Fiat 850 ""Lucciola"", while the ""largo"" (long) version used a floorpan lengthened by 15 cm and bodywork developed specifically by SEAT. The car was produced in Spain from April 1966 to 1974 and it was quite popular during that time. At the 1971 Paris Motor Salon, the 850 ""Especial Lujo"" (Special deLuxe) was presented, only available with the 4-door ""largo"" body. Production ended in late 1974, having been replaced by the SEAT 133, essentially an 850 rebodied in the style of the 127. Sedans and the standard coupé received 843 cc four-cylinder engines with either . After Fiat 850 production ceased in Italy in 1972, the SEAT version was sold in European countries through Fiat dealers for a couple of years. These cars had a Fiat badge which had ""costruzione SEAT"" underneath it. Production figures. The total production per year of SEAT 850 cars is shown in the following table : SEAT 850 Sport. The SEAT 850 Sport model was based on the Fiat 850 Coupé and Spider versions and was also available in two variants: The Sport Coupé and Spider versions were also built in Spain, although they were never exported. They were equipped with a 52 PS 903 cc engine as opposed to the lower powered, 843 cc standard cars. "
wikipedia-2266198," Vultee XP-54  The Vultee XP-54 ""Swoose Goose"" was a prototype fighter built by the Vultee Aircraft Company for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Design and development. Vultee had submitted a proposal in response to a U.S. Army Air Corps request for an unusual configuration. The Vultee design won the competition, beating the Curtiss XP-55 Ascender and the Northrop XP-56 Black Bullet. Vultee designated it Model 84, a descendant of their earlier Model 78. After completing preliminary engineering and wind tunnel tests, a contract for a prototype was awarded on 8 January 1941. A second prototype was ordered on 17 March 1942. Although it appeared to be a radical design, its actual performance was lackluster and the project was subsequently canceled. The XP-54 was designed with a pusher engine in the aft part of the fuselage. The tail was mounted rearward between two mid-wing booms, with the 12-ft propeller between them. The design included a ""ducted wing section"" developed by the NACA that enabled installation of cooling radiators and intercoolers in the inverted gull wing. The Pratt & Whitney X-1800 engine was initially proposed as the powerplant but after its development was discontinued, the liquid-cooled Lycoming XH-2470 was substituted.  In September 1941, the XP-54 mission was changed from low altitude to high altitude interception. Consequently, a turbo-supercharger and heavier armor had to be added, and the estimated empty weight increased from 11,500 to 18,000 lb (5,200 to 8,200 kg). The XP-54 was unique in numerous ways. The pressurized cockpit required a complex entry system: the pilot’s seat acted as an elevator for cockpit access from the ground. The pilot lowered the seat electrically, sat in it, and raised it into the cockpit. Bail-out procedure was complicated by the pressurization system and necessitated a downward ejection of the pilot and seat in order to clear the propeller arc. Also, the nose section could pivot through the vertical, three degrees up and six degrees down. In the nose, two 37 mm T-9 cannon were in rigid mounts while two .50 cal machine guns were in movable mounts. Movement of the nose and machine guns was controlled by a special compensating gun sight. Thus, the cannon trajectory could be elevated without altering the flight attitude of the airplane. The large nose section gave rise to its whimsical nickname, the Swoose Goose, inspired by a song about Alexander who was half swan and half goose: ""Alexander was a swoose."" Operational history. Flight tests of the first prototype, ""41-1210"", began on 15 January 1943. Initial trials showed performance substantially below guarantees. At the same time, development of the XH-2470 engine was discontinued and, although it appeared possible to substitute the Allison V-3420 engine without substantial airframe changes, the projected delay and costs resulted in a decision not to consider production buys.  The prototypes continued to be used in an experimental program until problems with the Lycoming engines and lack of spare parts caused termination. The second prototype, ""42-108994"" (but mistakenly painted as ""42-1211"") equipped with an experimental GE supercharger, only made one flight before it was relegated to a ""parts plane"" in order to keep the first prototype in the air.

wikipedia-2266227," SEAT Ronda  The SEAT Ronda (codenamed ""022A"") was a small family car produced by the Spanish automaker SEAT from 1982 to 1986, and styled by Rayton Fissore in collaboration with the Technical Centre in Martorell. The Ronda was also briefly sold in the United Kingdom as the SEAT Málaga hatchback.  The SEAT Ronda was a restyled SEAT Ritmo which in its turn derived from the Fiat Ritmo, however the Arbitration Chamber of Paris declared in 1983 that differences between those cars were important enough so as not to consider the Ronda as a rebadged Ritmo. The most visible external design differences between a Ritmo and a Ronda are rectangular headlights on the Ronda in place of the round ones featured on the Ritmo, different tail lights and panels, and changed door handles. Mechanically, there were also some differences. The Ronda featured a boot capacity of 370 litres which could be increased to 1,250 litres by folding rear seats. Powertrain. The engines were: Petrol Diesel The dispute with Fiat. In 1982 took place the end of the co-operation between SEAT and the automaker Fiat which had lasted almost 30 years. Conforming to the end of partnership agreement signed by the two automakers, SEAT had to quickly restyle its entire model range in order to be able to offer its models on sale, so that its cars would be now more distinct to those of the Italian firm. This would be marked by a change in SEAT's own logo and the first car under the new SEAT logo without Fiat involvement appeared that same year in 1982 : this was the SEAT Ronda. The launch of that model though sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against SEAT, as the former claimed the car was still too similar to a car in Fiat's own range, the Fiat Ritmo. In defence of SEAT, the then president of SEAT, Juan Miguel Antoñanzas, showed a Ronda to the press with all the parts different from the Fiat Ritmo painted in bright yellow, to highlight the differences. An El País journalist who covered the trial claimed that the result was spectacular. The case was eventually taken to the ICC International Court of Arbitration in Paris which in 1983 declared that differences between the cars were sufficiently substantial for the Ronda not to be judged as a rebadged Ritmo, ending the dispute in favour of SEAT. This also meant that SEAT was free to export the Ronda, although the car never sold particularly well outside of Spain. Rumour at the time had it that Fiat was angry because the Ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the Fiat Ritmo, which they had to scrap. "
wikipedia-2297065," Sniper Alley  ""Sniper Alley"" () was the informal name primarily for Ulica Zmaja od Bosne (Dragon of Bosnia Street), the main boulevard in Sarajevo which during the Bosnian War was lined with snipers' posts, and became infamous as a dangerous place for civilians to traverse. The road connects the industrial part of the city (and further on, Sarajevo Airport) to the Old Town's cultural and historic sites. The boulevard itself has many high-rise buildings giving sniper shooters extensive fields of fire. Mountains surrounding the city were also used for sniper positions, providing a safe distance and giving an excellent view on the city and its traffic. Although the city was under constant Serbian siege, its people still had to move about the city in order to survive, thus routinely risking their lives. Signs reading ""Pazi – Snajper!"" (""Watch out – Sniper!"") became common. People would either run fast across the street or would wait for United Nations armored vehicles and walk behind them, using them as shields. According to data gathered in 1995, the snipers wounded 1,030 people and killed 225 - 60 of whom were children.  "
wikipedia-2297089," The Ghost and Mrs. Muir  The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) is a romantic fantasy film starring Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison. It is based on a 1945 novel written by Josephine Leslie under the pseudonym of R. A. Dick. In 1945, 20th Century Fox bought the film rights to the novel, which had been published only in the United Kingdom at that time. It was shot entirely in California. Plot. In early 1900s England, a young widow, Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney), moves to the seaside village of Whitecliff and into Gull Cottage with her daughter Anna (Natalie Wood) and her maid Martha (Edna Best), despite the fierce disapproval of her mother- and sister-in-law. She rents the house despite discovering that the house is haunted. On the first night, she is visited by the ghostly apparition of the former owner, a roguish, but harmless sea captain named Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison), who reluctantly promises to make himself known only to her; Anna is too young for ghosts. When Lucy's investment income dries up, he dictates to her his memoirs, entitled ""Blood and Swash"". His racy recollections make the book a bestseller, allowing Lucy to stay in the house. During the course of writing the book, they fall in love, but as both realise it is a hopeless situation, Daniel tells her she should find a real (live) man. When she visits the publisher in London she becomes attracted to suave Miles Fairley (George Sanders), a writer of children's stories known as ""Uncle Neddy"" who helps her obtain an interview. Despite a rocky beginning, the publisher agrees to publish the captain's book. Fairley follows her back to Whitecliff and begins a whirlwind courtship. Captain Gregg, initially jealous of their relationship, decides finally to disappear and cease being an obstacle to her happiness. He convinces her that he was all a dream whilst she sleeps. Shortly thereafter while visiting her publisher in London, Lucy pays a surprise visit to Fairley's home and discovers that not only is Miles already married with two children, but that this sort of thing has happened before with other women. Lucy leaves heartbroken and returns to spend the rest of her life as a single woman in Gull Cottage with Martha to look after her. About ten years later, Anna (Vanessa Brown) returns with her Navy lieutenant fiancé and tells her mother that she knew about Captain Gregg and Miles Fairley all the time, rekindling faint memories in her mother of the captain (it is also revealed that Fairley has become fat and bald and that his wife and children finally left him). Lucy spends a long peaceful life at the cottage. Captain Gregg appears before her at the moment of her death – reaching out, he lifts her young spirit free of her body. The two walk out of the front door arm in arm, into the mist. Awards. ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" received a 1947 Academy Award nomination for Cinematography. Adaptations to other media. ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the December 1, 1947 broadcast of ""Lux Radio Theater"" with Charles Boyer and Madeleine Carroll, and was also adapted on the August 16, 1951 ""Screen Director's Playhouse"" with Boyer and Jane Wyatt. From 1968 to 1970, a TV sitcom entitled ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" starring Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare aired on NBC and ABC with the same premise as the book and film, but with a contemporary American setting. Mrs. Muir's first name was changed from 'Lucy' to 'Carolyn' for the series. DVD release. The film was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

wikipedia-2297090," Tied Test  A tied Test refers to a rare result in Test cricket when the side batting second is bowled out for the second time, with scores level. Only two ties have occurred in the 2,000 Tests played since 1877. The first was in 1960 and the second in 1986. On both occasions, the aggregate scores of both sides (teams) were equal at the conclusion of play and the side batting last had completed its final innings: 10 batsmen had been dismissed or, from the perspective of the side bowling, 10 wickets had been taken. In other words the runs, wickets and innings were exactly the same. In cricket, a tie is distinct from a draw, which occurs when play concludes without victory by either team (except where a Test has been formally abandoned). Both tied Tests involved the Australian cricket team. Both ended in the last possible over of play on the last day with a ball to spare, meaning that within the space of several minutes all four normal Test Match results were possible: a win for the batting side, a win for the fielding side, a draw or a tie. Bob Simpson is the only person to be involved in both tied Tests — as a player for Australia in the first, and as the Australian team coach in the second. First tied Test, 1960. The first tied Test was played between the West Indies and Australia. The match was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, known as ""The Gabba"", in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, between 9 and 14 December 1960.  Wes Hall was bowling, with the clock showing 5:56. Australia stood at 227–7, needing six runs to win from the 8-ball over (the standard for Tests in Australia at the time) with three wickets in hand. Australia were all out for 232 and the match ended in the first tie in 84 years of Test Cricket. Second tied Test, 1986. The second tied Test was the first Test of a three Test series, played between Australia and India, at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras, in India between 18 and 22 September 1986. The conditions were said to be extremely hot and humid. Greg Matthews was bowling to Ravi Shastri, with India's last man Maninder Singh at the bowler's end. India needed four runs to win from the 6-ball over with only one wicket remaining. India were all out for 347, Matthews having taken 5–146 (10–249 in the match) and Ray Bright 5–94, and the match was the second tie in Test cricket. Dean Jones and Kapil Dev were joint Men of the Match. Draws with scores level. In addition to the two tied Tests, there have been two Test matches which ended when time expired with the scores level in the fourth innings, but with the batting side still having wickets in hand. These matches are considered to be draws, rather than ties. These matches were: "
wikipedia-2297130," Abdominal examination  ♙ The abdominal exam, in medicine, is performed as part of a physical examination, or when a patient presents with abdominal pain or a history that suggests an abdominal pathology.  The abdominal exam has conventionally been split into different stages: When accompanying other physicians or students, medical staff typically report as they examine a patient. An example normal examination may include: Positioning and Environment. Position is patient should be supine and the bed or examination table should be flat. The patient's hands should remain at his/her sides with his/her head resting on a pillow. If the neck is flexed, the abdominal musculature becomes tensed and the examination made more difficult. Allowing the patient to bend his/her knees so that the soles of their feet rest on the table will also relax the abdomen. Lighting is adjusted so that it is ideal. Draping is patient should be exposed from the pubic symphysis below to the costal margin above - in women to just below the breasts. Some surgeons would describe an abdominal examination being from nipples to knees. Although physicians have had concern that giving patients pain medications during acute abdominal pain may hinder diagnosis and treatment, separate systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Rational Clinical Examination refute this. Inspection. The abdominal exam typically begins with the examiner inspecting the patient, paying particular attention to any signs of liver disease. These signs (stigmata) may include The patient is also examined for: Auscultation. Auscultation refers to the use of a stethoscope by the examiner to listen to the abdomen.  Auscultation is performed prior to palpation of the abdomen as it is least likely to elicit pain.  The doctor warms the diaphragm of the stethoscope, and listens to the bowel sounds. Some controversy exists as to the length of time required to confirm or exclude bowel sounds, with suggested durations up to five minutes. Bowel obstruction may present with grumbling bowel sounds or high-pitched noises. Absence of sounds may be caused by peritonitis. The examiner also typically listens to the two renal arteries for bruits, by placing the bell of the diaphragm adjacent and below the umbilicus. Palpation. The examiner typically palpates all nine areas of the patient's abdomen. This is typically performed twice, lightly and then deeply. On light palpation, the examiner tests for any palpable mass, rigidity, or pain.  On deep palpation, the examiner is testing for and organomegaly, including enlargement of the liver and spleen.  Reactions that may indicate pathology include: Percussion. The examiner, mindful of areas of discomfort, begins by palpating areas of no pain. Percussion is performed by knocking the middle finger against the phalanx of the middle finger of the opposing hand, which rests against the surface of the abdomen in each of the nine areas tested. Percussion can elicit a painful response in the patient, and may also reveal whether there is abnormal levels of fluid in the abdomen. Organomegaly may also be noted, including gross splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver), and urinary retention. The examiner, when percussing for organomegaly, percusses in a particular manner: Examination of the spleen Other & Special Maneuvers. Special manevures may also be performed, to elicit signs of specific diseases. These include "
wikipedia-2297133," Murphy's sign  In medicine, Murphy's sign refers to a maneuver during a physical examination as part of the abdominal examination and a finding elicited in ultrasonography. It is useful for differentiating pain in the right upper quadrant. Typically, it is positive in cholecystitis, but negative in choledocholithiasis, pyelonephritis and ascending cholangitis. During physical examination. Classically Murphy's sign is tested for during an abdominal examination; it is performed by asking the patient to breathe out and then gently placing the hand below the costal margin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line (the approximate location of the gallbladder). The patient is then instructed to inspire (breathe in). Normally, during inspiration, the abdominal contents are pushed downward as the diaphragm moves down (and lungs expand). If the patient stops breathing in (as the gallbladder is tender and, in moving downward, comes in contact with the examiner's fingers) and winces with a 'catch' in breath, the test is considered positive. In order for the test to be considered positive, the same maneuver must not elicit pain when performed on the left side. Ultrasound imaging can be used to ensure the hand is properly positioned over the gallbladder Predictive value. Murphy's sign has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value; however, the specificity is not high. In the elderly the sensitivity is markedly lower; a negative Murphy's sign in an elderly person is not useful for ruling out cholecystitis if other tests and the clinical history suggest the diagnosis. History. The sign is named for American physician John Benjamin Murphy (1857–1916), a prominent Chicago surgeon from the 1880s through the early 1900s, who first described the hypersensitivity to deep palpation in the subcostal area when a patient with gallbladder disease takes a deep breath.

wikipedia-2297139," Margaret H. Marshall  Margaret Hilary Marshall (born September 1, 1944) was the 24th chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and the first woman to hold that position. She was chief justice from 1999 to 2010. On July 21, 2010, she announced her retirement. Early life. Marshall was born in Newcastle, South Africa, where she led a student organization for three years called the National Union of South African Students, which was dedicated to ending oppressive minority rule and achieving equality for all South Africans. According to Marshall, ""There was no access to justice in South Africa...There were a few courageous barristers who agreed to represent people charged with political crimes, but, by and large, if you were a black South African, you had no justice. The death penalty was imposed in vastly disproportionate numbers. Many of the offenses were applicable to black South Africans only."". In 1984, she married then-""New York Times"" columnist Anthony Lewis. Legal career. From 1976 to 1989, she was an associate and a partner in private practice at the Boston law firm of Csaplar & Bok. From 1989 to 1992, she was a partner in the Boston law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart. Also from 1991 to 1992, she was president of the Boston Bar Association, the oldest bar association in the United States. From 1992-1996, she was general counsel to Harvard University. Marshall was appointed to be an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1996 by Republican Governor William F. Weld. She was named as chief justice in September 1999 by Republican Governor Paul Cellucci, to begin her term on October 14, 1999. She is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court, the oldest appellate court in the Western Hemisphere, and the first to serve as chief justice in its more than 300 year history. In the course of her term, she wrote more than 200 opinions. Marshall wrote the decision in ""Goodridge v. Department of Public Health"" that declared that the Massachusetts constitution does not permit the state to deny citizens the right to same-sex marriage. On July 21, 2010, Marshall announced her decision to retire from the court, effective at the end of October. Marshall said her decision was prompted by a desire to spend more time with her husband, former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease. Marshall formerly served as a member of the Yale Corporation, the governing body of Yale University. "
wikipedia-2297168," Chemical oxygen generator  A chemical oxygen generator is a device releasing oxygen created by a chemical reaction. The oxygen source is usually an inorganic superoxide, chlorate, or perchlorate. A promising group of oxygen sources are ozonides. The generators are usually ignited mechanically, by a firing pin, and the chemical reaction is usually exothermic, making the generator a potential fire hazard. Potassium superoxide was used as an oxygen source on early manned missions of the Soviet space program, for firefighters, and for mine rescue. In commercial airliners. Commercial aircraft provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In wide body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen. The oxidizer core is sodium chlorate (NaClO3), which is mixed with less than 5 percent barium peroxide (BaO2) and less than 1 percent potassium perchlorate (KClO4). The explosives in the percussion cap are a lead styphnate and tetrazene mixture. The chemical reaction is exothermic and the exterior temperature of the canister will reach . It will produce oxygen for 12 to 22 minutes. The two-mask generator is approximately in diameter and long. The three-mask generator is approximately in diameter and long. Accidental activation of improperly shipped expired generators caused the ValuJet Flight 592 crash. An ATA DC-10, Flight 131, was also destroyed while parked at O'Hare Airport, on August 10, 1986. The cause was the accidental activation of an oxygen canister, contained in the back of a broken DC-10 seat, being shipped in the cargo compartment to a repair station. There were no fatalities or injuries because the plane contained no passengers when the fire broke out. Oxygen candle. A ""chlorate candle"", or an ""oxygen candle"", is a cylindrical chemical oxygen generator containing a mix of sodium chlorate and iron powder. When ignited, the mixture smolders at about , producing sodium chloride, iron oxide, and about 6.5 man-hours of oxygen per kilogram of the mixture. It releases oxygen at a fixed rate. The mixture has an indefinite shelf life if stored properly; candles stored for 20 years have shown no decrease in oxygen output. The oxygen is released by thermal decomposition. The heat is supplied by the burning iron. The candle must be wrapped in thermal insulation to maintain the reaction temperature and to protect surrounding equipment. Potassium and lithium chlorate, and sodium, potassium and lithium perchlorates can also be used in oxygen candles. An explosion caused by one of these candles led to the deaths of two Royal Navy sailors on HMS Tireless, a nuclear-powered submarine, under the Arctic on March 21, 2007. The candle had become contaminated with hydraulic oil, which caused the mixture to explode rather than burn. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generators. Advances in technology have provided industrial oxygen generator systems for use where air is available and a higher concentration of oxygen is desired. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen. Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the oxygen generator, producing an oxygen-enriched gas. Nitrogen separation membrane equipment is also used. Uses. Chemical oxygen generators are used in aircraft, breathing apparatus for firefighters and mine rescue crews, submarines, and everywhere a compact emergency oxygen generator with long shelf life is needed. They usually contain a device for absorption of carbon dioxide, often a filter filled with lithium hydroxide; a kilogram of LiOH absorbs about half a kilogram of CO2. "
wikipedia-2297173," Master of Philosophy  The Master of Philosophy (M.Phil. or MPhil, sometimes Ph.M.) is an advanced postgraduate research degree. The prerequisites required for a Master of Philosophy make it the most advanced research degree before the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). An M.Phil. is in most cases thesis-only, and is regarded as a senior or second Master's degree, standing between a taught Master's and a Ph.D. An M.Phil. may be awarded to graduate students, after completing several years of original research but before the defence of a dissertation, and can serve as a provisional enrollment for a Ph.D. In the United States. Some American universities award the M.Phil. under certain circumstances. At those institutions (most notably Yale University, Columbia University, and the CUNY Graduate Center), the degree is awarded to Ph.D. candidates when they complete their required coursework and qualifying examinations prior to the completion and defense of a doctoral dissertation. This recognizes achievement beyond the Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees conferred after 1–2 years of graduate study and formalizes the more colloquial ""All But Dissertation"" status; as such, defense of a dissertation proposal is sometimes required for conferral. Many Ph.D. candidates at these universities view the M.Phil. as a formality and elect not to receive it in order to avoid the paperwork and costs involved. However, some programs do not offer an en route M.A. or M.S., so the M.Phil. is the first opportunity to receive a degree between the bachelor's and Ph.D; others may elect not to take the nominally lower M.A. or M.S. degree in favor of the M.Phil. or the Ph.D itself. Some colleges and universities, such as the College of the Atlantic, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Utah, offer a standalone M.Phil. degree in various fields. As per WES, the M.Phil program is treated as one year advanced graduate program. In Canada. Very few Canadian universities offer M.Phil degrees. Among their number, however, is Memorial University of Newfoundland's interdisciplinary two-year M.Phil in Humanities. In the United Kingdom. In most UK universities, completion of a M.Phil. typically requires two years of full-time or five years or more of part-time study (being five or seven years from initially entering university) and the submission of a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate. It is common for students admitted into a Ph.D. (or D.Phil.) program at a UK university to be initially registered for the degree of M.Phil., and then to transfer onto the Ph.D. upon successful completion of the first (or sometimes the second) year of study: this will often involve the submission of a short report or dissertation by the student, and possibly an oral examination or presentation. In addition, most universities allow examiners to recommend award of a M.Phil. if a Ph.D. candidate's thesis is deemed not to be of the requisite length or standard for a doctorate. However many students register for a M.Phil. with no intention of upgrading to a Ph.D., due to personal circumstances, due to their chosen research project having insufficient scope for a Ph.D or due to desiring to complete a slightly shorter qualification both in length and duration. At a few UK universities, a M.Phil. research degree can be achieved after only one year of study and is viewed as being equivalent to a taught M.A. or M.Sc. degree. However, in some institutions, such as University College London and the University of Aberdeen, a clear set of requirements must be met for the award of a M.Phil, under which candidates are required to submit and defend a thesis against external and internal examiners, a process which may in itself take up to a year, and, as such, the award may be regarded as a mini-PhD. For example, the degree of Master of Philosophy of the University of Aberdeen requires the submission of a thesis of up to 70,000 words plus a viva examination; this is a considerably larger piece of work than is required for the same qualification at other institutions.[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/education/programmes/research-dergrees-MPhilPhD.shtml Furthermore, at the University of Manchester, the candidate shall be required to attend an oral examination on the subject of the thesis and matters relevant thereto at the examiners’ discretion. The candidate may also be required by the examiners to undergo a written or other examination. The oral examination shall be attended by the candidate and the examiners and, if required, an independent chair. Each candidate shall be examined by two or more examiners of whom at least one shall be an external examiner. Oxford & Cambridge Universities. At Oxford University, the M.Phil. is a usually two-year Master's degree, although some programs are one-year. The M.Phil. requires both a lengthy thesis and more examinations than a one-year Masters degree (such as M.Sc., M.St.). Cambridge University offers the M.Phil. as a one-year Master's degree program. This is to distinguish it from the Oxbridge M.A. degree, to which B.A. graduates usually proceed after a certain period of time without any further study (a procedure which has been followed at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin since the seventeenth century). The Cambridge M.Phil. can be either a taught degree or a research-based degree, depending on the course. Ancient Scottish universities. The ancient Scottish universities, who for historical reasons award the Scottish M.A. degree upon completion of four-year first degree programs in arts and humanities subjects, differ in their use of M.Phil. or M.Litt. for postgraduate research degrees, but are slowly standardizing to the M.Phil. as a research degree and the M.Litt. as a taught degree. In the Netherlands and Belgium. In the Netherlands and Belgium the M.Phil. is a special research degree and only awarded by selected departments of a university (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archaeology, Philosophy and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career. After finishing these programs, students normally enroll for a Ph.D. program. The Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science has decided not to recognize the MPhil degree. Accordingly, some Dutch universities have decided to continue to grant the MPhil degree but also offer a legally recognized degree such as MA or MSc to those who receive the MPhil degree. In Norway. In Norway, the degree of MPhil is a 'standard' Master's degree (120 ECTS credits) at a level equivalent to an MA or MSc. Upon completion, the MPhil qualifies for acceptance to a PhD program, but is most often taken as a stand-alone qualification. The MPhil is not a common degree in Norway; most universities award MA (in humanities or social sciences) or MSc (in technical and scientific subjects) degrees. In Finland. In Finland, the regular (first) Master's degree ""filosofian maisteri"" translates to ""Master of Philosophy"". However, the term ""philosophy"" is to be understood to the maximum extent, because this is the name of the basic Master's degree in all natural sciences and humanities. It does not imply a specialization in theoretical philosophy or even other than introductory studies. In fact, most of the students majoring in philosophy get a degree with a different name (Master of Sociology or Politics). These degrees are regular Master's degrees, not special ""higher"" degrees (cf. Licentiate and Doctor of Philosophy). In the past, ""filosofian maisteri"" signified that the degree was earned through actual studying, in contrast to honorary Master's degrees that could be granted by application to Bachelors. In Malaysia. In Malaysia, the M.Phil. degree is not well known. There are only a handful of universities in Malaysia that offer M.Phil. program, such as Universiti Malaya, Wawasan Open University, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC), Monash University Sunway Campus (MUSC) and others. In most cases, M.Phil. is a pure research degree and from case to case basis, it will result in viva voce examination before the degree is awarded. For UNMC and MUSC, the Faculty of Engineering offer standalone M.Phil. degree which will lead the path to Ph.D. and normally regarded as a more prestigious Master degree than typical taught master degree such as M.Sc. or M.Eng.. In the case for University Malaya, if the desired field of research does not belong to any of the specialized faculties, it is normally categorized under the M.Phil. supervised by the Postgraduate Institute. In November 2012, Malaysian Qualifications Agency has issued programme standards for postgraduate studies in which MPhil is attributed to Master programme by research and mixed mode (coursework and research).

wikipedia-2297189," Hans-Jörg Butt  Hans-Jörg Butt (; born 28 May 1974) is a German retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper.  Known for taking penalty kicks, he scored 26 goals in the Bundesliga. He played for Hamburger SV, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich in his country, having arrived at Munich already aged 34. During his career, Butt scored three times from the penalty spot against Juventus with three different clubs. He represented Germany in two World Cups and Euro 2000. Personal life. Butt was born in Oldenburg and raised in nearby Großenkneten, where his father Jochen ran a company manufacturing loading ramps and industrial doors. As a youngster, he played for the junior teams of his local football club, TSV Großenkneten, as a striker. Butt is married to Katja. As of November 2010, the couple had three children – a daughter and two sons. Club career. Hamburg/Leverkusen. Butt started his professional career with modest VfB Oldenburg, achieving promotion to the second division. He moved to Hamburger SV in the 1997 summer and, in his second season, scored seven goals for the team – all from the penalty spot – adding nine in similar fashion the following campaign. Butt joined Bayer 04 Leverkusen on a free transfer in 2001, being the side's undisputed starter in the subsequent campaigns (he only missed one Bundesliga match in his first five seasons combined and added seven goals), and appeared in all the games (17) for a team that lost to Real Madrid in the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League final, scoring a penalty in a 3–1 home win against Juventus F.C. in the second group stage. In 2003–04, after scoring a penalty in an away match against FC Schalke 04 on 17 April 2004, Butt turned away from midfield and began to enthusiastically celebrate with his teammates. Immediately after he raised his hand to signal readiness (while still jogging back toward his net), Schalke player Mike Hanke shot the ball from the halfway line and scored on the oblivious keeper. Benfica. After losing Leverkusen's nets to the young René Adler during the 2006–07 season, Butt decided to cancel the contract that linked him to the club until 2009, activating a clause that allowed him to leave the club should he fail to appear in less of the games during the second half of the campaign. In July 2007, he signed a two-year deal with Portuguese giants S.L. Benfica.  Butt made his ""Reds"" debut in the summer tournament of ""Torneio de Guadiana"", held between Benfica, Sporting Clube de Portugal and Real Betis. In the competition, he saved a penalty against Betis, helping Benfica with the final win. At the Lisbon outfit, however, he played understudy to Portuguese international Quim, being used in the domestic cup matches. He only made one league appearance for Benfica, coming on as a substitute after Quim was sent off against C.S. Marítimo in October 2007 – in this match, he saved a penalty from Ariza Makukula with his first touch of the game, and his team eventually won 2–1. Bayern Munich. On 4 June 2008, Butt signed a two-year contract with reigning champions FC Bayern Munich and was expected to act as backup to Oliver Kahn's heir, highly-rated young Michael Rensing. He made his official debut for the club in the Champions League round-of-16 second leg against Sporting Lisbon in a 7–1 home drubbing, on 10 March 2009. With Rensing dropped to the bench following a 5–1 loss at Vfl Wolfsburg, he also started the remaining games of the season, as the initial first-choice was also nursing a hand injury.  After the team's poor start to the 2009–10 season with Rensing in goal, Butt was reinstated as the first-choice. On 8 December 2009, he scored his first goal for the club, a crucial penalty in the club's last Champions League group stage match at Juventus, coming from behind to a 4–1 victory – after this feat, he managed to score a goal against Juventus in the Champions League for all three major German clubs he represented.  On 30 January 2010, Butt missed out on the opportunity to score his first league goal for Bayern as his penalty was saved by 1. FSV Mainz 05's Heinz Müller, but it proved to be of no detriment to the club as it won 3–0. On 16 February, he was rewarded for an outstanding season with a contract extension until 2011. He was also in goal for the Champions League final, where his team was denied an historic treble after losing 0–2 to F.C. Internazionale Milano. Midway through the 2010–11 season, 36-year old Butt lost his starting place to another club youth graduate, Thomas Kraft. However, a series of unconvincing displays by the youngster, including a 2–3 home loss against Inter Milan in the Champions League quarterfinals on 15 March 2011, and a 1–1 away draw with 1. FC Nürnberg on 9 April, paved the way for the veteran to return to the starting line-up, which happened on 17 April, in a 5–1 home victory over former club Bayer Leverkusen, and he still appeared in 30 official games during the campaign (23 in the league), as his team finished in third position. On 3 May 2011, Butt signed a one-year extension to his contract with Bayern, backing up newly signed Manuel Neuer. He retired at the end of the season at the age of 38, after a friendly with the Netherlands on 22 May 2012 in which he acted as captain. International career. Butt was Germany's third-choice goalkeeper, behind Kahn and Jens Lehmann, at both the UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup, remaining an unused substitute in both tournaments.  He won three international caps for Germany in friendly matches, his debut coming against Liechtenstein on 7 June 2000, where he appeared for the second half of an 8–2 routing. On 6 May 2010, Butt, Neuer and Tim Wiese were chosen as Germany's goalkeepers for the 2010 World Cup, with the Bayern man taking the place of former Leverkusen team-mate Adler, who had to withdraw due to a rib injury. He made his first competitive international appearance on 10 July, appearing in the 3–2 win against Uruguay in the tournament's third-place playoff. Post-retirement. Butt was appointed head of the Bayern Munich Junior Team on 1 July 2012. He left the position on 7 August, stating ""I misjudged this field of activity, for which I’ve had responsibility for a few weeks now. I approached my new appointment with great enthusiasm, but I have realised that the task does not offer the satisfaction and passion I wanted. This is the reason for my decision. I would like to thank FC Bayern for their understanding."" Club statistics. ""Statistics accurate as of 28 April 2012"" "

The band released four singles in 1982 and 1983: ""John Wayne is Big Leggy"", ""Holy Joe"", ""Shiny Shiny"", and ""Sister Friction"", and an album, ""Battle Hymns For Children Singing"". The original plan had been for Garner to perform alone. The band made a crude video performance and sent that instead of a demo tape to record companies. Their outfits were often designed by Garner. The two singers looked like distorted mirror images of each other, with similar hair and make-up. In a 1983 interview with David Maples on the Los Angeles-based TV show ""MV3"", Jeremy Healy accused the singer known as Boy George (George O'Dowd) of stealing his infamous look. Boy George later put the record straight: ""When Jeremy saw my locks he was livid. Both he and Kim stopped speaking to me. They thought I had stolen their look. It wasn't their look to steal..."" After Haysi Fantayzee, Garner appeared alongside Bananarama in the music video for ""Who's That Girl"" by the Eurythmics. She had a brief solo career after the break-up of Haysi Fantayzee, and then pursued a career in photography in Los Angeles, California. Healy released the single ""When Malindy Sings"" in 1984, and later became a DJ and album mixer for other artists, including his former schoolfriend, Boy George. He recorded on George's More Protein record label under the name E-Zee Possee. Caplin now runs Caplin Systems, an internet software company. "
wikipedia-2297262," Deep vein  A deep vein is a vein that is deep in the body. This contrasts with superficial veins that are close to the body's surface. Deep veins are almost always beside an artery with the same name (e.g. the femoral vein is beside the femoral artery). Collectively, they carry the vast majority of the blood. Occlusion of a deep vein can be life threatening and is most often caused by thrombosis. Occlusion of a deep vein by thrombosis is called ""deep vein thrombosis"". Deep veins are these blood vessels which are embedded far into the flesh, and if needing operation, it can be difficult.  "

wikipedia-2297312," Tel Aviv Light Rail  The Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area Mass-Transit System is a long planned mass transit system for the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. The system will include different types of rapid transit like light rail (which will run underground in some areas), bus and more. Work on the Red Line, the first in the project, started on September 21, 2011, following years of preparatory works and numerous delays. History. The first proposals for a tramway in the area were made by the Lebanese engineer George Franjieh in November 1892, about nine weeks after the inauguration of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. The plan called for a main line between southern and northeastern Jaffa, with spurs to the harbor and the eastern orchards. The plan was considered uneconomical and was shelved. A later plan called for a light railway from Jaffa to the nearby settlements of Rishon LeZion, Petah Tikva and Wilhelma. A Decauville light railway was built in Jaffa and Tel Aviv in World War I, connecting the port with the Yarkon River. It was used for about a decade after the war, and dismantled at a later date. A subway system was first planned in the mid-1960s, and in 1967 a station at the Shalom Meir Tower was inaugurated in the presence of then Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. However, financial difficulties forced the abandonment of the project, and Shalom Meir remains the only subway station in Tel Aviv, disconnected from other transport links. Back on track. In 2000, the plan for a subway was changed to one for light rail, and more plausible plans for a mass transit system in Tel Aviv were unveiled. The first Red Line has been approved, and excavation began in late 2009. The Red Line is expected to become operational in 2016. In December 2006, the MTS group was awarded a BOT contract for the Red Line of the light rail, by which they are to build and operate the line for its first 32 years. MTS consists of Africa Israel, Siemens of Germany, the Egged Bus Cooperative, Chinese infrastructure company CCECC, the Portuguese infrastructure firm Soares da Costa, and the leading Dutch transportation company HTM. After many years of delays due to MTS financing issues, in December 2010 the government revoked MTS' concession and nationalized the project, putting it under the authority of NTA, the government agency which was in charge with overseeing the overall development of the rapid transit system in the Tel Aviv metro area. Alstom, which supplied the trams for the Jerusalem Light Rail, plans to bid to supply trams, as well as signals, and electrical and control systems. A significant portion of the Tel Aviv Light Rail will be underground, so Tel Aviv may be viewed as the fifth city in the Middle East to boast a subway system. Haifa was first with the Carmelit in 1959, while the Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, the Tehran Metro opened in 1999, the Dubai metro was the fourth when it opened in 2009. Current status. Right to 2010, only the Red Line has been under construction, but the construction which has been completed and is in progress is only infrastructural. The construction has been finished on some portions of the overground phase of the line and the underground phase hasn't been started yet. The advanced phases of construction are two years late as the owner of the line, MTS, has had financial difficulties and postponed some of the portions. The Israeli government wants to deny the ownership to MTS due to the postponements and construct the line on its own. The Israeli government plans to construct the Red Line, Green Line and Purple Line simultaneously in order to close the gap which created by MTS. Furthermore, Bombardier Transportation has offered to receive the ownership from MTS and offers to use the Flexity 2 rolling stock to the lines. No decision has been made yet. The NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd. has published a tender for 90 carriages, with the option of buying 30 more. NTA will begin reviewing bids from companies starting June 2013. Planned lines. The blueprint includes eight lines: two in planning stages, one under approval, one under construction, and four more planned for the future. The first four lines will cover 100 km (62 mi) around the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, with future plans to BRT lines and feeders in addition. Red Line. About of the Red Line is to be built underground, with the remaining overground segment constructed in as a light rail/tram. It is to have 33 stops, 10 of which would be underground, with an average distance of 500 metres between them. The average distance between the overground stops would be 1 km. The line would run from Bat Yam in the southwest, through Jaffa and central Tel Aviv, and carry on to Petah Tikva, through Ramat Gan and Bnei Brak. An interchange is planned for Tel Aviv Central railway station. It has been forecast that by 2020, 100 million people would be using this line annually. Stations (underground in ""italics""): Nissenbaum, HaAmal, Kaf Tet BeNovember, Yoseftal, Bar Ilan, Balfour, Jabotinsky, Rothschild, HaAztmaut, Machrozet, HaBaashat, Issakov, Erlich, Ben Tzvi, Salame, Elifelet, ""Allenby"", ""Carlebach"", ""Yehudit"", ""Shaul HaMelech"", ""Arlozorov"", ""Abba Hillel"", ""Bialik"", ""Ben-Gurion"", ""Aharonowitz"". From Aharonowitz, one branch continues to Shenkar, Rabin, Beilinson, Dankner, Orlov, Pinsker, Petah Tikva Central Bus Station (Terminal); another continues to ""Em HaMoshavot"" and the Kiryat Aryeh Maintenance Depot. Green Line. The second or Green Line, in the approval phase, is a line with 58 stops that would run from the west of Rishon LeZion northwards through Holon through central Tel Aviv and will split into two branches: One to Herzliya in the north, and one to Ramat HaHayal neighborhood in Tel Aviv in the northeast. Only its central Tel Aviv segment would be underground, from Levinski Street through Ibn Gabirol Street until the Yarkon River. Four of the fifty-eight stations will be underground. The expected annual passenger forecast is 65 million. NTA is including the design and boring of the Green Line's tunnels as part of Red Line's tunnels overall contract so that work on the Green Line's underground portion can commence immediately following the completion of the Red Line tunnels. Purple Line. The third, or Purple Line, also in the planning phase, is envisaged as a line with 56 stops and will connect Petah Tikva Sgula to Sheba Hospital through Giv'at Shmuel and Kiryat Ono, and will connect Arlozorov in Tel Aviv to Yehud and Or Yehuda through Ramat Gan. There are considerations to make the central part of the line (From Sheba Hospital to Arlozorov) underground. Yellow Line. This line is being planned. It will begin in Kfar Saba then continue on to Hod Hasharon, Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon on Sokolov Street, before joining Ben-Gurion Street in Ramat Gan, then Yitzhak Rabin Street in Givataim, then Moshe Dayan Street in Tel Aviv, Mikveh Israel, it will end in Holon after crossing Ariel Sharon Park. This line was designed initially as a bus rapid transit, however, currently the possibility of making it a light rail line is being considered. Blue Line. The fifth, or Blue Line, is the first line of the BRT system and the first line not to pass via Tel Aviv. The line will begin in Rehovot and continue to HaRishonim Railway Station in Rishon LeZion via Ness Ziona and end at the Holon junction. Brown Line. The sixth, or Brown Line, is a planned BRT line that will serve the southern metropolitan area, beginning in Moshe Dayan Railway Station at western Rishon LeZion in a connection with the Red Line and the Green Line, continues east via central Rishon Lezion, Bypasses Assaf HaRofeh Medical Center, and continues to Ramle where it splits into two branches: One continues to Lod in the northeast, and the second continues to eastern Ramle in the east. There is a possibility of making it a light rail line eventually. Pink Line. The seventh, or Pink Line, is a planned BRT line that will serve the northern metropolitan area, beginning in northeastern Kfar Saba and continues through its main streets until, crossing Highway 4 to Ra'anana and continues through Ahuza Street until western Ra'anana and continues to Herzliya and crosses it until the Marina area, where it terminates. There is an alternative service of the line through Highway 4 and Highway 2 to Tel Aviv, that splits from the main service in the Kfar Saba-Ra'anana border. Orange Line. The eight and last to date, or Orange Line, is a planned BRT line that will be the only line which is isolated from the system. It will serve only the city of Netanya in the northern metropolitan area. It will be a circular line that connects the both sides of the city, crossing Highway 2. Current route of the line is still unknown. The line will be connected to the system only through other transport means, like Israel Railways and buses. "
wikipedia-2297321," Superficial vein  Superficial vein is a vein that is close to the surface of the body. This differs from deep veins that are far from the surface. Superficial veins are not paired with an artery, unlike the deep veins, which typically have an artery with the same name close by.  Superficial veins are important physiologically for cooling of the body. When the body is too hot the body shunts blood from the deep veins to the superficial veins, to facilitate heat transfer to the surroundings. Superficial veins can be seen under the skin. Those below the level of the heart tend to bulge out. An immediate way to see this by looking at your hand: raise it above your heart and the blood should drain--lower it below your heart it will fill. Veins become more visually prominent when lifting heavy weight, especially after a period of proper strength training. Physiologically, the superficial veins are not as important as the deep veins (as they carry less blood) and are sometimes removed in a procedure called vein stripping, which is used to treat varicose veins.

Skyhawks. In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee determined that the then-current Stonehill College mascot, the chieftain, was politically incorrect as it was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. The committee ruled that a new mascot be named as the institution's athletic identity. Therefore, in the following year the college held open forums in which students, alumni, and faculty were asked to submit ideas for the new identity, vote on suggestions, and gauge popularity. Among popular choices were The Stonehill Summit, The Stonehill Skyhawks, The Stonehill Saints, The Stonehill Wolfpack, The Stonehill Crusaders, The Stonehill Mission, The Stonehill Shovelmakers, and The Stonehill Blizzard.  During the fall semester of the 2005 academic year Stonehill College officially changed the name of its athletic teams to the ""Stonehill Skyhawks,"" with a brand new mascot known as 'Ace', an anthropomorphic purple hawk wearing a scarf, goggles, bomber jacket, and an aviator cap. The actual name 'Skyhawks' is not a reference to either a bird or animal. It is instead an homage to a type of airplane that Frederick Ames allowed to land on his property (what is now the main campus) during World War I. The name is linked closely to the school's history in this way. "
wikipedia-2297349," Ichigo Kurosaki  Ichigo's character was created to replace Rukia as the lead character from the series as Kubo noted that Rukia was unsuitable to be the protagonist. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has also been released, including toys, clothing, and action figures. Ichigo's character has been well received among both fans and reviewers, and people all over the world. Ichigo is also featured in ""Weekly Shōnen Jump"" character popularity polls, consistently ranking as one of the most popular characters in ""Bleach"", while the 2007 Japanese ""Newtype"" magazine polls ranked him as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have also remarked favorably on his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti-hero. Appearances. In the ""Bleach"" manga and anime series. Ichigo Kurosaki is a 15-year-old boy who attends Karakura High School. At the age of nine, Ichigo witnessed his mother’s death at the hands of the Hollow Grand Fisher who later was killed by Ichigo's father. One day his family was attacked by a Hollow, and a Shinigami (死神, literally “Death God”) named Rukia Kuchiki gives her Shinigami powers to Ichigo, so he can save his family. For a few months, Ichigo acts as a Shinigami replacement and protects Karakura Town from Hollows. Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai from Soul Society come to take Rukia back because the transference of Shinigami powers to a human is a capital offense. Ichigo loses his powers in the process and trains with Kisuke Urahara to regain them. During his training, Ichigo learns the name of his zanpakutō, Zangetsu (斬月, literally “Slaying Moon”). He regains his Shinigami powers but also indirectly gains Hollow powers then heads off to Soul Society with Orihime Inoue, Uryū Ishida, Yasutora Sado, and Yoruichi Shihōin to save Rukia. In Soul Society, Ichigo is joined by Ganju Shiba and fights Ikkaku Madarame, the 3rd seat of the 11th Division. Ichigo defeats Ikkaku and learns that Kenpachi Zaraki, the captain of the 11th Division, intends to fight him. Along the way, Ichigo and Ganju take Hanatarō Yamada hostage and he shows them the way to Rukia. Ichigo fights Renji for a second time and defeats him in order to continue on. After the fight, Ichigo is healed by Hanatarō and then encounters Kenpachi Zaraki. Ichigo struggles to cut the captain at first but then Zangetsu helps him find his resolve and defeat Kenpachi. Yoruichi tends to Ichigo’s injuries then Ichigo goes to save Ganju and Hanatarō from Byakuya Kuchiki. Yoruichi, knowing Ichigo cannot win, incapacitates him and promises Byakuya that she’ll make Ichigo stronger in three days. Ichigo learns his Bankai Tensa Zangetsu (天鎖斬月, literally “Heaven Chain Slaying Moon”) and saves Rukia before she is executed. Ichigo fights Byakuya with temporary help from his inner Hollow, resulting in a tie and the realization of Byakuya that what Ichigo had been truly fighting is laws of Soul Society instead of him. While Soul Society is in chaos, Sōsuke Aizen reveals himself as a traitor and steals the Hōgyoku from Rukia’s body. Ichigo learns that Aizen was the mastermind behind the events going on in Soul Society and then is easily defeated by the former captain. After Aizen escapes, Ichigo is made a Substitute Shinigami by Jūshirō Ukitake and returns to the Human World.  Eventually, with the Hōgyoku, Aizen employs an army of Arrancars with his Espadas attacking Ichigo and his friends in the human world. In order to fight the Espada, Ichigo is taught how to control his Hollow powers with the aid of the Visards that were members of the Soul Society until Aizen's actions forced them to live among humans. As a result of defeating his inner Hollow, Ichigo can call upon his Hollow powers at will don a Hollow mask through a limited time. Although they fend off the Arrancars with the bolstered defenses, they are unable to prevent the abduction of Ichigo's friend, Orihime Inoue. When Soul Society refuses to save her, Ichigo and his friends go to Hueco Mundo to rescue her on their own. Ichigo manages to keep her safe after several fights against the Arrancars, leaving that it was distraction as he almost became a complete Hollow during his battle with the Espada Ulquiorra Schiffer. Going to Karakura Town to protect it from Aizen, Ichigo is disillusioned to learn that Aizen knew of him from the beginning and everything he went through was arranged. However, snapped out of it by his father Isshin, revealed to be a Soul Reaper, Ichigo learns an attack that weakens Aizen at the expense of his Soul Reaper powers. As Ichigo's powers fade away, Urahara seals Aizen within a kidō barrier.  Seventeen months later, Ichigo becomes a senior in high school. He meets Kūgo Ginjō from the group Xcution who presents Ichigo with a chance to regain his Soul Reaper powers in return of helping Ginjō and his group be free of their own ""Fullbringer"" powers. With their help, Ichigo unlocks his own Fullbring powers through his Substitute Soul Reaper Badge. However, when Ichigo is attacked by Shūkurō Tsukishima, one of Ginjō's allies who changed his memories to trick Ichigo, his Fullbring powers are stolen. The Soul Society's forces then restore his Soul Reaper powers as an act to repay Ichigo's deeds to the Soul Society. Ichigo then engages Ginjō in combat, killing him in the aftermath. Following these events, Ichigo assists a Soul Reaper named Ryūnosuke Yuki in a fight with some Hollows. Ichigo is later attacked by an Arrancar with Quincy abilities. He is then is informed of Sasakibe's death at the hands of the Vandenreich, and also of their invasion of Hueco Mundo. Ichigo returns to Hueco Mundo with his friends to liberate it from the Vandenreich. While fighting the Quincy Kirge Opie, Ichigo discovers that the Soul Society is under attack, and defeats his opponent. Ichigo then heads to Soul Society, arriving just after Yamamoto's death. While in Soul Society, Ichigo encounters the leader of the Vandereich, Juhabach. Juhabach tells Ichigo that he knows nothing about himself, not even about his own mother, implies that Ichigo has Quincy blood in him, and that he has inherited his mother's, a Quincy's, powers.  When the Royal Guard arrive, they take Ichigo, Renji, Rukia and Byakuya with them. After Ichigo and Renji are healed they meet Ōetsu Nimaiya, inventor of the Zanpakuto, to have their broken Zanpakuto reforged. However, feeling that Ichigo must know his roots first, Nimaiya sends Ichigo back to the Land of the Living. There, Ichigo learns of how his father and mother, respectively a Soul Reaper captain and a Quincy, met. Ichigo also learns that Masaki's near Hollowification is the reason for his abilities as a Visard and a Fullbringer. Afterwards, Nimaiya brings Ichigo back and, after Ichigo passes his test, decides to reforge Zangetsu. In other media. Ichigo appears in the featured films of series; protecting a Soul Reaper named Senna in ', aiding in the search for Tōshirō Hitsugaya in ', and investigating a mysterious incident, involving Rukia Kuchiki being erased from everyone's memory in ', and going into Hell in order to rescue Yuzu in '. He also appears in both of the original video animations; fighting against a hollow called the Grand Fisher in the first one and combating the rogue Soul Reaper Baishin in the second one. In the ""Bleach"" video games, Ichigo is a playable character in every game, including the and series. In some games, his hollow form and ""bankai"" state are available as separate characters. In ""Rock Musical Bleach"", a musical based on the ""Bleach"" series, he is played by Tatsuya Isaka. His character is featured in two volumes from the ""Bleach Beat Collection"" CD soundtrack series which features themes composed by his Japanese voice actor, Masakazu Morita. These include the first of them in which he is the only character and the fourth season's fourth volume along with Rukia. Creation and conception. When creating the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first character he created, did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo to be the series protagonist. When designing Ichigo's appearance, Kubo had thought of several types attributes of the character that were never added to the story. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and kind eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at that time. In latter chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. Along with Orihime Inoue, Ichigo has the hardest face to draw for Kubo. When making illustrations featuring Ichigo, he found one weird as it featured him with a cheerful smile. Kubo considered Ichigo's greatest strength to be that he is considerate and thoughtful as he always thinks about other people's needs. However, he also saw that as his greatest weakness, since worrying about his friends tends to put him in danger. Kubo was asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus in the love triangle between him, Rukia and Orihime, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he did not want to focus in romance. Kubo thinks Ichigo is very popular among fans because he ""looks cool"". He also mentioned that as fans read more about him they discover that underneath he is warm and kind hearted, which attracts them. Following over fifty volumes of the manga released, Kubo believes that Ichigo was the character that was developed the most. He emphasized how every action Ichigo changes the course in the story as well as how he feels attached to the character. When the Arrancar arc ended, Kubo tried rebooting the series which resulted in Ichigo losing his Soul Reaper powers. In the same way Ichigo became a Soul Reaper during the series' first chapter, he starts searching for methods to recover his original powers. Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while as a child he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While enjoying Ichigo as one his best roles, Morita notes that voicing him can be difficulty as a result of the character's thoughts before his actions. Bosch has liked Ichigo's character due to how he wants to protect people. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in the episodes in which Ichigo shouts for a long time. Reception. Amongst the ""Bleach"" reader base, Ichigo has been highly popular, having always ranked within the top 5 in the ""Weekly Shōnen Jump"" popularity polls for the series. He has usually taken first place, though in early 2008 he dropped to 3rd place. His ""zanpakutō"", Zangetsu, also ranked 3rd in the ""zanpakutō"" popularity polls. His character also appeared in the 2007 Japanese ""Newtype"" magazine polls ranked him as one of the best anime male characters. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Ichigo ranked as the third best male character. The Japanese music distributor Recochoku has made two annual survey of which anime characters that people would like to marry. Ichigo ranked tenth in the category ""The Character I Want to Be My Groom"" from the 2008 survey and eight in the 2009 poll in the same category. Wizard Entertainment considered Ichigo the best hero from 2007, commenting that he does not try to be a hero as he just fights in order to protect his friends or to return a debt. He was also 20th in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with comments focused on his design and personality. Ichigo has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007, Masakazu Morita won in the category ""Best Rookie Actor"" for his role as Ichigo Kurosaki. Ichigo's voice actor in the English adaptation, Johnny Yong Bosch, has also been praised for his voice work on Ichigo's character by Anime News Network (ANN), which favorably compared Bosch and Morita's work. Various merchandise based on Ichigo's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key-chains. Since the series was released, replica models of Ichigo's ""zanpakutō"" and ""bankai"" have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans.  Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Ichigo's character. Mania Entertainment reviewer Chris Beveridge commented that Ichigo's history about how he becomes a Soul Reaper in the series could be ""obvious"", but it is avoided by how Ichigo tries to avoid his role. Additionally, he commented that Ichigo does have ""awkward moments"" when fighting with hollows or handling his ""zanpakutō"", making him a more normal person. ANN's Melissa Harper commented that Ichigo's initial rebellious actions make him almost a stereotypical anti-hero, but note that he is soon revealed to be a more complex character with a sad past. ""Los Angeles Times""s Charles Solomon comments Ichigo's persona has little in common with protagonists from other series due to his bad temper and how he tends to fight. However, he added that readers from the series still ""love"" Ichigo. Although the way Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper was found to be relatively common by Carlos Alexandre from popcultureshock.com he noted that was unimportant, and then added Ichigo's character of a ""tough guy with a heart of gold"" had already been done in several series. Charles White from IGN praised Ichigo's climactic fight against Byakuya Kuchiki as one of the best fights in the ""Bleach"" series, and later Ramsey Isler gave additional praise to both the design and voice acting for Ichigo's inner hollow. Ichigo's development during the story arc in which he sets to rescue Rukia Kuchiki from being executed have been praised by ANN's Theron Martin with the scenes in which he manages to stop her execution and his subsequent demonstration of his ""bankai"" as one of the ""eminently satisfying landmark moments in the series"". Wired News's Corrina Lawson stated that she liked Ichigo's strong sense of responsibility, and commented it was one of the reasons of the series' popularity. "
wikipedia-2297360," Median cubital vein  In human anatomy, the median cubital vein (or median basilic vein) is a superficial vein of the upper limb. It connects the basilic and cephalic vein and is often used for venipuncture (taking blood). It lies in the cubital fossa superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis. There exists a fair amount of variation of the median cubital vein. More commonly the vein forms an H-pattern with the cephalic and basilic veins making up the sides. Other forms include an M-pattern, where the vein branches to the cephalic and basilic veins. "
wikipedia-2297371," Getter Robo G  People familiar with Mattel's popular Shogun Warriors toy collection will remember all three of Getter Robo G's robot formations in that toy line: Getter Dragon (Dragun), Getter Liger (Raider) and Getter Poseidon (Poseidon). As a result of the popularity of these toys in the US, Jim Terry included this series in his Force Five anime lineup under the title of Starvengers. Some Starvengers episodes were redubbed and released by FB Productions under the Robo Formers title. The original ""Getter Robo"" series, however, has yet to appear in the US (although the Shin Getter Robo OVAs have appeared). In the UK, Starvengers episodes were released on video by Krypton Force under the name Formators. Plot. After the final defeat of the Dinosaur Empire and the death of Musashi Tomoe in the original Getter Robo series. Dr. Saotome, (Dr. Copernicus in 'Starvengers') creator of Getter Robo, fears that the peace the Getter Robo team has won will be short lived and that even greater enemies will appear. Dr. Saotome's fears are justified when the Hundred Demon Empire (""Hyakki Teikoku"", also known as the Pandemonium Empire in 'Starvengers') appears. Composed of horned, devil-like alien humanoids, and possessing a technology advanced enough to build giant demonic robots, this militaristic organization intends to steal Saotome's Getter Generator to fulfill their own goals of world domination. But Dr. Saotome is prepared with the creation of an even more powerful Getter Robo, Getter Robo G and a new Getter Robo base. Also, with Musashi dead, Dr. Saotome needs a third pilot which he finds in baseball player Benkei Kuruma. Getter Machines. Like its predecessor, Getter Robo G is composed of three jet-like vehicles piloted by one of the three pilots. Dragon is the red jet, controlled by the pilot of Getter Dragon. Liger, the blue jet, is used by Getter Liger's pilot. Getter Poseidon's operator uses Poseidon, the yellow machine. All three are armed with missiles, but are generally very weak and never used in combat unless absolutely necessary. They also appear when the pilots use the Open Get (Break Formation in the English Version) verbal command to break up the current form, so that they can change into another or so they can dodge an enemy's attack.

wikipedia-2297376," Basilic vein  The basilic vein is a large superficial vein of the upper limb that helps drain parts of the hand and forearm. It originates on the medial (ulnar) side of the dorsal venous network of the hand and travels up the base of the forearm, where its course is generally visible through the skin as it travels in the subcutaneous fat and fascia lying superficial to the muscles. Near the region anterior to the cubital fossa, in the bend of the elbow joint, the basilic vein usually connects with the other large superficial vein of the upper extremity, the cephalic vein, via the median cubital vein (or median basilic vein). The layout of superficial veins in the forearm is highly variable from person to person, and there is a profuse network of unnamed superficial veins that the basilic vein communicates with.  As it ascends the medial side of the biceps in the arm proper (between the elbow and shoulder), the basilic vein normally perforates the brachial fascia (deep fascia) above the medial epicondyle, or even as high as mid-arm. There, around the lower border of the teres major muscle, the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral veins feed into it, just before it joins the brachial veins to form the axillary vein.  Along with other superficial veins in the forearm, the basilic vein is an acceptable site for venipuncture. Nevertheless, IV nurses sometimes refer to the basilic vein as the ""virgin vein,"" since with the arm typically supinated during phlebotomy the basilic vein below the elbow becomes awkward to access, and is therefore infrequently used. Vascular surgeons sometimes utilize the basilic vein to create an AV (arteriovenous) fistula or AV graft for hemodialysis access in patients with renal failure. "
wikipedia-2297390," Brachial veins  In human anatomy, the brachial veins are venae comitantes of the brachial artery in the arm proper. Because they are deep to muscle, they are considered deep veins. Their course is that of the brachial artery (in reverse): they begin where radial veins and ulnar veins join (corresponding to the bifurcation of the brachial artery). They end at the inferior border of the teres major muscle. At this point, the brachial veins join the basilic vein to form the axillary vein.  The brachial veins also have small tributaries that drain the muscles of the upper arm, such as biceps brachii muscle and triceps brachii muscle. "
wikipedia-2297409," Queen of Outer Space  Queen of Outer Space is a 1958 American CinemaScope science fiction feature film starring Zsa Zsa Gabor, Eric Fleming, and Laurie Mitchell in a tale about a revolt against a cruel Venusian queen. The screenplay by Charles Beaumont was based on an outline supplied by Ben Hecht. The film was directed by Edward Bernds, has been broadcast on television, and has been released to VHS and DVD. Plot. Capt. Patterson (Eric Fleming) and his space crew (Dave Willock, Patrick Waltz, and Paul Birch) crash land on Venus and are captured. They learn the planet is under the dictatorship of cruel Queen Yllana (Laurie Mitchell), a masked woman who has banished men from the planet. In the palace, the astronauts are aided by a beautiful courtier named Talleah (Zsa Zsa Gabor) and her friends (Lisa Davis, Barbara Darrow, and Marilyn Buferd). The women long for the love of men again and plot to overthrow the evil Queen. When Patterson has the opportunity to remove the Queen's mask, he discovers she has been horribly disfigured by radiation burns caused by men and their wars. In a fury, the Queen decides to destroy Earth and its warlike peoples but she dies in the attempt. The Venusians are free again to enjoy the love of men. Cast. Cast includes Guy Prescott as Col. Ramsey (uncredited), Gerry Gaylor as Base commander, Ralph Gamble as Officer in anteroom (uncredited), and Joi Lansing as an astronaut's girlfriend (uncredited). Venusians are played by Tania Velia, Norma Young, Marjorie Durant, Brandy Bryan, Ruth Lewis, and June McCall. Production notes. The Three Stooges and The Bowery Boys director Edward Bernds recalled that after famed producer Walter Wanger was released from prison for shooting agent Jennings Lang in the groin for having an affair with his wife Joan Bennett, Wanger could only find work at Allied Artists. In 1952 Wanger brought a ten page idea for a screenplay by Ben Hecht called ""Queen of the Universe"" that was a satirical look at a planet run by women. Several years later, with the idea of science fiction films being more common, Allied Artists revived the project with Wanger replaced on the film by Ben Schwalb who was then producing the Bowery Boys films. Screenwriter Charles Beaumont didn't think there was much in the Hecht screenplay, but Schwalb suggested spoofing the idea and had former Three Stooges screenwriter Ellwood Ullman touch up Beaumont's screenplay. Allied Artists retitled the film ""Queen of Outer Space"" as they thought the original title sounded more like a beauty pageant. The film recycled many ideas such as a planet ruled by women from other science fiction films of the era as ""Abbott and Costello Go to Mars"", ""Cat-Women of the Moon"" (both 1953) and the British ""Fire Maidens from Outer Space"" (1955). ""Queen of Outer Space"" also recycled many props and costumes, most prominently the C-57D crewmen's uniforms and Altaira's wardrobe from ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956), models, sets, and special effects from Bernds's ""World Without End"" (1956), the usual stock footage of an Atlas and a rocketship model (and stock footage) built for the film ""Flight To Mars"". The model was eventually used by The Bowery Boys in ""Paris Playboys"" (1954) that was co-written by Bernds and Ullman. The facial makeup of the deformed Queen strongly resembles the effect of being hit by a pie thrown by The Three Stooges.

wikipedia-2297434," Polylactic acid  Polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the United States), tapioca roots, chips or starch (mostly in Asia), or sugarcane (in the rest of the world). In 2010, PLA was the second most important bioplastic of the world in regard to consumption volume. The name ""polylactic acid"" does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, and is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid (polyelectrolyte), but rather a polyester. Production. There are several industrial routes to usable (i.e. high molecular weight) PLA. Two main monomers are used: lactic acid, and the cyclic di-ester, lactide. The most common route to PLA is the ring-opening polymerization of lactide with various metal catalysts (typically tin octoate) in solution, in the melt, or as a suspension. The metal-catalyzed reaction tends to cause racemization of the PLA, reducing its stereoregularity compared to the starting material. Another route to PLA is the direct condensation of lactic acid monomers. This process needs to be carried out at less than 200 °C; above that temperature, the entropically favored lactide monomer is generated. This reaction generates one equivalent of water for every condensation (esterification) step, and that is undesirable because water causes chain-transfer leading to low molecular weight material. The direct condensation is thus performed in a stepwise fashion, where lactic acid is first oligomerized to PLA oligomers. Thereafter, polycondensation is done in the melt or as a solution, where short oligomeric units are combined to give a high molecular weight polymer strand. Water removal by application of a vacuum or by azeotropic distillation is crucial to favor polycondensation over transesterification. Molecular weights of 130 kDa can be obtained this way. Even higher molecular weights can be attained by carefully crystallizing the crude polymer from the melt. Carboxylic acid and alcohol end groups are thus concentrated in the amorphous region of the solid polymer, and so they can react. Molecular weights of 128-152 kDa are obtainable thus. Polymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides usually leads to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), which is amorphous. Use of stereospecific catalysts can lead to heterotactic PLA which has been found to show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, and to a lesser extent on the type of catalyst used. Apart from lactic acid and lactide, lactic acid ""O""-carboxyanhydride (""lac-OCA""), a five-membered cyclic compound has been used academically as well. This compound is more reactive than lactide, because its polymerization is driven by the loss of one equivalent of carbon dioxide per equivalent of lactic acid. Water is not a co-product. The direct biosynthesis of PLA similar to the poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s has been reported as well. Manufacturers. As of June 2010, NatureWorks was the primary producer of PLA (bioplastic) in the United States. Other companies involved in PLA manufacturing are PURAC Biomaterials (The Netherlands) and several Chinese manufacturers. The primary producer of PDLLA is PURAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CSM located in the Netherlands. Galactic and Total Petrochemicals operate a joint venture, Futerro, which is developing a second generation polylactic acid product. This project includes the building of a PLA pilot plant in Belgium capable of producing 1,500 tonnes/year. Since 2009, PURAC has been producing lactides D and L - monomers for PLA production - at a plant in Spain with a production capacity of several thousand tons. In February 2012, PURAC opend a 75,000-ton/year lactide plant at their production site in Thailand (Rayong Province). PURAC developed the technology to polymerize these lactides with Sulzer, a Swiss engineering company. Purac collaborates with various PLA production partners to increase production and develop new markets for PLA. Thanks to the availability of D-lactide, PURAC partners will be able to use stereo-complex technologies to produce new PLA grades (HDT) stable up to 180 degrees C. In a tripartite collaboration between PURAC, Sulzer, and Synbra, solutions were developed to allow Synbra to produce PLA and subsequently E-PLA, an attractive biodegradable and potentially bio-based alternative to EPS foam in a variety of application areas. This collaboration was awarded by Frost and Sullivan with the Innovation of the Year Award in 2008. Chemical and physical properties. Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly-L-lactide (PLLA) is the product resulting from polymerization of L,L-lactide (also known as L-lactide). PLLA has a crystallinity of around 37%, a glass transition temperature between 60-65 °C, a melting temperature between 173-178 °C and a tensile modulus between 2.7-16 GPa. However, heat resistant PLA can withstand temperatures of 110 °C. PLA is soluble in chlorinated solvents, hot benzene, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane. PLA has similar mechanical properties to PETE polymer, but has a significantly lower maximum continuous use temperature. Polylactic acid can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber (for example using conventional melt spinning processes) and film. The melting temperature of PLLA can be increased 40-50 °C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60°C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 50:50 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 3-10% of PDLA, there is still a substantial improvement. In the latter case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent, thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA. There is also poly(L-lactide-""co""-D,L-lactide) (PLDLLA) – used as PLDLLA/TCP scaffolds for bone engineering. Applications. Poly(lactic acid) can be processed by extrusion, injection molding, film & sheet casting, and spinning, providing access to a wide range of materials. Being able to degrade into innocuous lactic acid, PLA is used as medical implants in the form of screws, pins, rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down within the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. PLA can also be used as a compostable packaging material, either cast, injection molded, or spun. Cups and bags have been made of this material. In the form of a film, it shrinks upon heating, allowing it to be used in shrink tunnels. It is useful for producing loose-fill packaging, compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware. In the form of fibers and non-woven textiles, PLA also has many potential uses, for example as upholstery, disposable garments, awnings, feminine hygiene products, and diapers. Racemic and regular PLLA has a low glass transition temperature, which is undesirable. A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures lending it more mechanical strength. It has a wide range of applications, such as woven shirts (ironability), microwavable trays, hot-fill applications and even engineering plastics (in this case, the stereocomplex is blended with a rubber-like polymer such as ABS). Such blends also have good form-stability and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra, a long lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for lipoatrophy of cheeks. Progress in biotechnology has resulted in the development of commercial production of the D enantiomer form, something that was not possible until recently. PLA is also used as a feedstock material in 3D printers such as Reprap and Makerbot. Recycling. Currently, the SPI resin identification code 7 (""others"") is applicable for PLA. In Belgium, Galactic started the first pilot unit to chemically recycle PLA (Loopla). Unlike mechanical recycling, waste material can hold various contaminants. Polylactic acid can be recycled to monomer by thermal depolymerization, or hydrolysis. When purified, the monomer can be used for the manufacture of virgin PLA with no loss of original properties (cradle-to-cradle recycling). "
wikipedia-2297470," Ted Ammon  Robert Theodore Ammon (August 30, 1949 - October 20, 2001) was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 30, 1949. He was an American financier and investment banker. Ammon was murdered in 2001 by Daniel Pelosi, a companion of Ammon's estranged wife. He left a widow, Generosa Ammon, whom he had married on February 2, 1986, and two children: twins Greg Ammon and Alexa Ammon, who had been adopted from the village of Medvedivtsi in the Mukachevo Region of Ukraine in October 1992. At the time of his murder, Ted and Generosa Ammon were near finalization of their divorce. The custody agreement had been signed on October 18, 2001, and the divorce agreement/judgment was expected to be consented to the following week. After Ammon's death, Generosa Ammon married Daniel Pelosi; she died of cancer on August 22, 2003. Early life. Ted Ammon was awarded an academic/Regents diploma from East Aurora High School in upstate New York. He matriculated at Bucknell University (Lewisburg, Pennsylvania) for his undergraduate studies. He majored in economics, was a member of the school's swimming team, and subsequently played on its varsity lacrosse team. He also became an active member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Ammon aspired to purse his career out west, so moved to San Francisco, California after college. There, he worked in a Woolworth’s warehouse, while applying for job vacancies in his field. Several months later, he was accepted into Bank of America’s international banking executive training program. He completed the course, and in December 1973 married Randee Day, a fellow program participant. Shortly thereafter, the couple accepted positions in Chicago. Ammon continued with Bank of America, and his spouse went to work for another financial institution. In December 1974, the pair relocated to England, Ammon agreeing to the move in furtherance of his wife’s career. There, he pursued a career in law. He passed the bar exam in Great Britain, even though he never attended a traditional law school class. Following receipt of his solicitor credential, he undertook employment with Norton, Rose, Botterell & Roche. Much of his work was concentrated in maritime law. Career. After the Ammons moved back to the United States, he secured a position with Lord, Day and Lord. He subsequently went to work at the prominent law firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt. One of this firm’s clients was the then small investment firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR). In 1983, following his legal work on a KKR deal (and his divorce from his first wife), Ammon was recruited by the private equity firm, which specialized in leveraged buy-outs. Ammon served as an Associate at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. from 1984-1989 and as a General Partner from 1990-1992. He worked on many deals, notably the famous $31 billion RJ Reynolds/Nabisco takeover. He joined his colleagues in becoming a multimillionaire and was quoted numerous times in the book """". According to Russ Baker in the May 2002 issue of ""Gotham"", “He was along for the wild ride as KKR grew into one of Wall Street’s most aggressive and storied leveraged buyout outfits.”  In 1992, Ammon left KKR in order to establish his own company, Big Flower Press. The firm became a leader in the printing of advertising inserts for newspapers. Ammon’s goal was to create relationships with newspapers nationwide and then to provide them with other needed commodities. Big Flower was later renamed Vertis Holdings, Inc. Through more than thirty acquisitions, the firm diversified geographically and became a leading international supplier of integrated marketing services, including high value printing, advertising, and imaging technology. Vertis went public in 1995; in 1999, it was acquired by a group of investors, including Ammon, in a private leveraged re-capitalization. Ammon served as Chief Executive Officer from the company’s inception until April 1997 and as Chairman of the Board from the company’s formation through December 2000. With Vertis facing dramatically changing market conditions (e.g., a high debt multiple and a slowing pace of acquisitions), a mutually advantageous separation/payout agreement was worked out between Vertis and Ammon. During his time at Vertis, Ammon had put together a “deal team” and venture capital program, managing an in-house venture business. He also had set up several holding companies, which held the vast share of his ownership interests. These ventures directly invested in both public and nonpublic companies and in such general areas as technology, media, marketing and management services, and the Internet. The specific fields of these companies included print and digital technology, diagnostic radiology, long-distance telephone service, and biopharmaceutical innovation.  After leaving Vertis, Ammon oversaw his team’s venture capital investments through the entities that he had established. Much of the money that Vertis had paid to Ammon provided seed money for his investments. Two the most profitable investments were in Moore Corporation Limited, a Vertis competitor, and in National Imaging Associates, Inc., a provider of health care services. Divorce and murder. Ammon's marriage turned hostile after Generosa found a receipt for a divorce lawyer in his desk. They were days from finalizing their divorce when he was found bludgeoned to death in his East Hamptons vacation home. Because their divorce was not finalized and Ammon's will had not been changed, Generosa inherited 50% of his estate, in accordance with the will, with the balance going to the Ammon Foundation. On January 15, 2002, Generosa married Daniel Pelosi, then sold the properties she had owned jointly with Ammon. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was appointed along with Generosa as co-executor of the estate. Ultimately, Generosa's estate inherited Ted's estate. The estate did not pass until after her death. Pelosi was convicted of Ammon's murder in December 2004 and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Charity. Ammon created the largest scholarship fund at Bucknell University Bucknell. Subsequently, he complemented this endowed program with a challenge/matching grant, resulting in added incentives for others to contribute to his alma mater. He served on the boards of the Municipal Art Society, and the YMCA. He attained to the title of Chairman at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he worked closely with Wynton Marsalis. On October 22, 2012, Greg and Alexa Ammon donated a $1 million gift from the Ammon Foundation to Jazz at Lincoln Center to name the R. Theodore Ammon Archives and Music Library. ""Ted considered the archive and music library essential to the integrity of this institution. The Ammon Archives and Music Library will be accessible to students and lovers of jazz the world over,” said Wynton Marsalis, Managing and Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. “My father’s deep commitment to Jazz at Lincoln Center inspired my sister Alexa and I to continue his legacy with this naming gift for the preservation and perpetuation of the music he loved so much. Wynton’s vision for The Ammon Archive and Music Library aligns with my father’s commitment to enrich people’s lives around the world with jazz.” said Greg Ammon. On November 15, 2012, Jazz at Lincoln Center hosted a private ribbon cutting for The Ammon Archives and Music Library followed by the New York City film premiere of Greg Ammon’s documentary, 59 Middle Lane later that evening. Proceeds from the premiere event benefited Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute. Funeral. Thousands of people attended a Manhattan memorial service for Ammon in Alice Tully Hall, the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Among the Wall Street dignitaries in attendance were Henry Kravis, head of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co, Apollo Capital chief Leon Black, and Roger Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary under U.S. President Bill Clinton. Ammon’s two children sat with the family but without their mother since, at the request of Ammon’s sister, Sandra, Generosa did not attend.  At the service, Wynton Marsalis honored him with a New-Orleans-style jazz send-off. Before playing the funeral march, Marsalis spoke to the congregation. “We want to know the particulars of death—it repulses us, it calls us, it fascinates us…but only the dead know the facts of death, and they never tell. Generosa died of breast cancer in August 2003. She left the majority of her estate to the twins, and legal guardianship of them to their nanny, Kaye Mayne. Full custody of the twins was eventually awarded to Ammon's sister; they spent the remainder of their childhood with her in Huntsville, Alabama. David Sutcliffe played Ammon in the TV movie ""Murder in the Hamptons"" (also known as ""Million Dollar Murder""). "
wikipedia-2297594," Ashok Banker  Ashok Kumar Banker (born 7 February 1964 in Mumbai, India) is an author and former journalist. His writing spans crime thrillers, essays, literary criticism, fiction and mythological retellings. The author of several well-received novels including a trilogy billed as ""India's first crime novels in English"", he became widely known for his retellings of Indian mythological epics, starting with the internationally acclaimed and bestselling eight-volume Ramayana Series, which has been credited with the resurgence of mythology in Indian publishing. The New York Times credited him with making mythology the most successful category in Indian publishing, describing his work as being ""better written than many books in the genre that have followed - introduced the Ramayana to a new generation of readers."" His books have sold 1.8 million copies and have been published in 13 languages in 57 countries. His Epic India Library is an attempt to retell all the myths, legends and itihasa of the Indian sub-continent in one massive story cycle comprising over 70 volumes, ""an epic library of India"". He is frequently nominated and shortlisted as one of India's top thinkers and celebrities. Early life. Parentage. Banker was born to an Anglo-Indian Christian mother and a Gujarati Hindu NRI father. His parents were estranged before he was born and he was subsequently raised by his mother and maternal grandmother but due to his biological father having been a Hindu, he was given the freedom to decide which religion he wished to pursue, if any. His mother entered ""Indian"" in the then-contentious column for Religion/Caste in his birth certificate. As divorce was rarely granted at the time, she was compelled to convert to Islam in order to secure a divorce from her Hindu husband. Banker was raised in an Anglo-Indian Christian atmosphere. Subsequently, Banker has said in numerous interviews that when the time came for him to choose which religion he wished to belong to, he chose simply ""to stay human"". Abuse Due to Racial, Religious and Caste Prejudice. Banker has often commented publicly about abuse he faced growing up on account of his lack of religion, caste or racial identity. Describing himself as a 'post-racial post-religious' Indian. His refusal to identify himself as belonging to a caste, religion or community has caused many conflicts, since it is at odds with India's traditional caste-based social structure and has resulted in his being ostracized by his peers. This culture of segregation and systematic bias has turned him away from his estranged biological father's religion Hinduism, and Banker grew up with little or no exposure to Hindu culture, religion or literature. He identified himself with other minorities and his closest friends were Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Jews. He took Farsi and Urdu lessons for a time and even won a college-level prize for Urdu-Translation in collaboration with a Pakistani friend. The son of an Iranian dissident fleeing the Shah regime stayed briefly with Banker's grandmother in Byculla, exposing Banker further to radical Islamic thought and culture. Among his close friends were the son and daughter of the Rabbi of the Magen David Synagogue in Byculla, who also studied at the same high school. Banker's marriage to his Hindu wife also ended due to differences in belief systems.  Career. Journalism. Ashok Banker worked as a successful freelance journalist and columnist for several years, breaking front-page news for publications such as ""The Times of India"", Mumbai, and cover stories for ""Outlook magazine"", New Delhi. He was earlier also known as a prolific reviewer and commentator on contemporary Indian literature, and as a candid essayist with a particular focus on media hypocrisy in India, and the western racial bias against South Asian writers. He was a prolific literary critic and reviewer, known for his candour and bluntness in reviewing books by Indian authors. His views often veered from the outright derogatory to effusive praise. Literary Contribution. Banker is a contemporary Indian novelist often counted among the significant literary names in post-colonial Indian literature His work is the focus of several academic studies for its cross-cultural themes and realistic portrayals of Indian urban issues. He is one of few contemporary Indian authors writing in English to be included in prestigious anthologies such as ""The Vintage Book of Modern Indian Literature"" and ""The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature"". His work has been the subject of dissertations, course study material, and is frequently included in the syllabi or reading lists of management institutes and studies of modern Indian English Literature. He is credited as having introduced Indian mythology to a new generation of readers with works that have been described as ""better written than many books in the genre that followed"", ""well paced"" and ""breathes humanity into characters that most Indians consider deities. This brings freshness to the old stories and makes their intricate, discursive narratives more accessible to an audience that has been bred on the linear plots of Hollywood and Bollywood movies."" Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror. The stories of his """"Devi"""" series are short works featuring Avatars of the Hindu goddess Devi, and have appeared in various science fiction, fantasy, and horror magazines. Several of these genre publications have claimed that his was the first speculative fiction by an Indian Author writing in English to be published. Due to his early association with the scifi genres, his work is often found on several recommended reading lists and discussed in seminars, conventions, essays and books. His ""Gods of War"" was released by Penguin in 2009. Autobiographical Work. Three of his novels contain autobiographical elements and are closely related to one another. His first novel (though the fifth published) ""Vertigo"" is about a man struggling to make a successful career and home life in Bombay (the former name of Mumbai). ""Byculla Boy"" takes its name from the Byculla suburb of Bombay where he and his mother grew up. ""Beautiful Ugly"" and the complementary documentary of the same title are a tribute to his mother, portraying the tragic events of her life. Mythological Retellings. Banker is best known for his Ramayana Series, a freely imaginative retelling of the ancient Sanskrit epic poem. The series is ranked at No.1 on the ""Internet Book List"". The eight-book Series was published in 56 countries and 7 languages to considerable critical acclaim. In India, the Series continues to enjoy popularity and sales. It is often credited with being either directly or largely responsible for the current resurgence of interest in mythology. It has been called ""super-cool"" (The Hindu), ""a milestone"" (India Today) and ""a magnificent labor of love"" (Outlook) and appeared on most major recommended reading lists during its publication. The first series fiction to find such success in Indian publishing, it has since been followed by numerous imitators, spawning the burgeoning mythology genre. At least one Indian publisher, Westland Books, has capitalized on the success of Banker's Ramayana Series by publishing other authors such as Amish Tripathi and Ashwin Sanghi, finally signing on the ""epic Indian storyteller"" himself in 2012 for his 18-volume Mahabharata Series. eBook Success. One of the first Indian authors to embrace changing technology, Banker began sharing his work online with readers as early as 1995, when public internet access began in India. He has been credited as the author of the first ebook by an Indian author, the first online serial novel, the first multimedia novel, and numerous other early experiments with digital publishing. In response to increasing demand from his readers and the considerable delay by Indian publishers in embracing electronic publishing technologies, Banker began publishing and distributing ebook editions of his own work through his website and later through a dedicated ebookstore. The result was India's first ebook bestsellers and first successful independent ebookstore. As of April 2013, AKB eBOOKS had sold over 50,000 ebooks. As a result, Banker has said he intends to use the knowledge he has acquired in the course of researching and writing his epic mythology series into creating ""informative, interactive books for the iPad"". Bibliography. His previously published works include: "
wikipedia-2297597," Imperial Bank of India  The Imperial Bank of India (IBI) was the oldest and the largest commercial bank of the Indian subcontinent, and was subsequently transformed into State Bank of India in 1955. Origin. The Imperial Bank of India came into existence on 27 January 1921 by J.M. Keynes. when the three Presidency Banks of colonial India, were reorganized and amalgamated to form a single banking entity. The three Presidency banks were the Bank of Bengal, established on 2 June 1806, the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843) Activities. Imperial Bank of India performed all the normal functions which a commercial bank was expected to perform. In the absence of any central banking institution in India until 1935, the Imperial Bank of India also performed a number of functions which are normally carried out by a central bank. Epilogue. The Reserve Bank of India, which is the central banking organization of India, in the year 1955, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India, and the Imperial Bank of India was christened on 30 April 1955 as the State Bank of India, and this transformation from the Imperial Bank of India to the State Bank of India was given legal recognition in terms off an Act of the Parliament of India, which came into force from 1 July 1955. The day on which the Imperial Bank of India (IBI) became the State Bank of India, IBI had 480 branches, sub-offices, and three local head offices; and had under its control and command slightly more than a quarter of the resources of the Indian banking industry. The branch network of State Bank of India has since grown to 9093 branches as on 31 March 2004. In 2007 Reserve Bank of India transferred its stake in State Bank of India to Government of India. "
wikipedia-2297615," Bengie Molina  Benjamin José ""Bengie"" Molina (born July 20, 1974, in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico), nicknamed ""Big Money"", is a former Major League Baseball catcher and currently the assistant hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is the older brother of major league catchers José Molina and Yadier Molina.  Initially regarded as a ""good glove, no hit"" catcher with a strong arm and an exceptional ball blocker, Molina won a Gold Glove as the top defensive player at his position in consecutive seasons in and . But he also developed into a very good contact hitter and free-swinging power hitter. Between 2000 and 2007, he struck out just 331 times, and in 2000 led the American League in average at-bats between strikeouts, with 14.3. However, at 5' 11"" and weighing 225 pounds, he was regarded as one of the slowest baserunners of his day. High school and college. Molina graduated from the Maestro Ladí High School with honors in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, and played shortstop for Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona, in 1991 and 1992. Playing career. Anaheim Angels/Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (1998-2005). Molina entered the major leagues by playing two games for the Anaheim Angels in , and a handful of games in . He became the Angels' regular catcher in 2000 and remained so through the season. Over his last few seasons with the Angels, his backup as catcher was his brother, José Molina. Bengie Molina got his first championship ring in 2002 after the Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in the 2002 World Series. Toronto Blue Jays (2006). Bengie Molina's contract with the Angels expired after the 2005 season, and the team decided not pursue him because of the salary he would demand. He signed a 1-year $5 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a mutual option for a second year. After signing with the Blue Jays, Molina expressed his anger at the Angels over how he parted company with them. ""The way they let me go without a notice, without calling me, that said a lot,"" Molina said. ""That's what really hurts me. I think I built a good relationship with them,"" he said. ""They never let me know. They just threw me like a piece of trash."" Molina's agent, Alan Nero, later confirmed however, that both he and Molina had in fact received calls from the Angels informing them of the team's decisions. Nero suggested that Molina's comments were borne of his disappointment that he was not retained by the Angels. While Molina was expected to catch most of the Jays' season with Gregg Zaun serving as his backup, his difficulties with right-handed pitchers led the Jays to use a platoon system. San Francisco Giants (2007-2010). After the 2006 season, Molina became a free agent and signed a three-year, $16 million deal with San Francisco. Molina hit his 100th home run on September 5, 2007, off Jorge Julio in the sixth inning of a 5–3 victory against the Colorado Rockies. Molina was announced as the Willie Mac Award winner for 2007 (for spirit and leadership) in a pregame ceremony on September 21, 2007. He got the most out of 1,617 votes from the fans. Later in that September 21 game, Molina knocked in career RBI number 500 in the bottom of the first on a single that scored Dave Roberts. They lost the game to the Cincinnati Reds 9–8 in 11 innings. In 2007, Molina walked only 2.9% of the time, the lowest percentage in the NL. On September 26, 2008, Molina became the first player in MLB history to hit a home run and not get credit for a run scored. In the 6th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit a ball off the right field wall at AT&T Park which the umpire called in fair play, and wound up at first base. Emmanuel Burriss immediately ran out to first base to pinch run for Molina before anyone else could intervene, as Giants manager Bruce Bochy discussed the matter with the umpires. However, the umpires used instant replay and subsequently ruled the hit a home run, but refused Bochy the opportunity to reinsert Molina into the game. San Francisco continued the game under protest, but won 6–5 in the 10th inning. Preceding the same game, Molina had received the Willie Mac Award for the second year in a row. In 2009 he led the majors in sacrifice flies (with 11), and received an unintentional walk in only 1.9% of his plate appearances, the lowest percentage in the NL for those with at least 350 PA. On January 19, 2010, Molina re-signed a 1 year $4.5 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. Texas Rangers (2010). Following one of the Giants' longer losing streaks of the season, and the sudden emergence of rookie catcher Buster Posey, Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers on June 30, 2010, for relief pitcher Chris Ray and a player to be named later, which was minor league RHP Michael Main. As two of the Giants' best pitchers commented upon Molina's departure, his contributions to the Giants were very significant. ""He helped me mature and succeed. I've said time and time again that he deserves half of those awards that I've gotten,"" said Tim Lincecum, the reigning two-time National League Cy Young Award winner. ""The things he's done for me – for calling a game, to give me confidence throwing different pitches in different counts – really, really, really benefited me,"" Matt Cain said of Molina. Notorious for his lack of baserunning ability, on July 16, 2010, Molina hit for the cycle against Boston. He had (in order) a single, double, home run (grand slam), and triple. He was then pinch run for and left the game in the top of the 8th inning after hitting the triple, with a leg injury. He is the fifth Texas Ranger to hit for the cycle. He is also the first catcher in MLB history to hit a grand slam and hit for the cycle in the same game. During the 2010 American League Division Series Molina (again despite his poor baserunning ability) stole a base in Game 5, his first in over four years. He also hit a home run in Game 1. In Game 4 of the 2010 American League Championship Series, with 2 outs in the 6th inning and the Rangers trailing the New York Yankees, 3–2, Molina hit a 3-run home run off A. J. Burnett. The home run, arguably one of the most important in Rangers history, proved to be the game-winner for the Rangers and gave the underdog Rangers a commanding 3–1 lead in the series. The Rangers won the ALCS against the Yankees in 6 games, which allowed the Rangers to enter the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Since the Texas Rangers made it to the World Series, along with the San Francisco Giants, Bengie Molina became the sixth player to play for the two World Series teams in the same season. Due to having played for both Giants and Rangers during the 2010 season, Molina was guaranteed to receive a World Series ring regardless of whether his current or former team won the World Series. In the 2010 World Series, Molina batted only .182 with one RBI. The Rangers eventually lost the World Series to the Giants in 5 games. After the season was over, Bengie Molina was released as a free agent. Bengie Molina spent most of the 2011 season on free agency and eventually retired. Coaching career. St. Louis Cardinals (2013-present). After his retirement, Molina accepted the Cardinals' offer on December 14, 2012 to be their assistant hitting coach to John Mabry. "
wikipedia-2297652," Steve Erickson  Stephen Michael Erickson (born April 20, 1950), pen name Steve Erickson, is an American novelist, essayist and critic. He is the recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters's Award in Literature and a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation., and is considered an important representative of the Avantpop movement. Biography. Steve Erickson was born and brought up as an only child in Los Angeles. For many years his mother, a former actress, ran a small theatre in L.A; his father (died in 1990) was a photographer. When he was a child he stuttered badly. Because of his stuttering some teachers believed that he could not read. This motif occasionally has recurred in his novels, such as ""Amnesiascope."" Erickson studied film at UCLA (BA, 1972), then journalism (M.A. 1973). For a few years he worked as a freelance writer for alternative weekly newspapers. His first novel, ""Days Between Stations,"" was published in 1985. Since 1985 Erickson has published nine novels and two non-fiction books, ""Leap Year"" and ""American Nomad"". Erickson himself appears briefly as a fictional character in Michael Ventura's 1996 novel, ""The Death of Frank Sinatra"". Erickson has written on a variety of topics in periodicals including ""The New York Times Magazine"", ""Esquire"" and ""Rolling Stone"" among others. Currently he is a teacher with the MFA Writing Program at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and is the editor of the national literary magazine ""Black Clock"". He has written about film for ""Los Angeles"" magazine since 2001 and twice has been nominated for the National Magazine Award in criticism. Erickson's work has been admired and cited by other authors including Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, Jonathan Lethem and Mark Z. Danielewski. In describing his influences, he states:When I think of writers who have had an impact on me, I come up with people that never get named my reviewers. Faulkner, Henry Miller, the Brontës, Stendahl, Paul Bowles, Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler. I would have to include in that group Márquez, who is one writer that has been cited, and you’ve probably got to include in that group Pynchon, simply because Pynchon is a little like Joyce. His influence is so pervasive these days that you can’t help but be influenced by him. Erickson's novel ""Tours of the Black Clock"" appears on critic Larry McCaffery's list of the ; and in a winter 2008 poll by the National Book Critics Circle of 800 novelists and writers, Erickson's ""Zeroville"" was named one of the five favorite novels of the previous year. In March 2011, ""Variety"" announced that actor-director James Franco had acquired feature rights to ""Zeroville"". He lives with his family in Topanga Canyon, in Southern California. Recurring motifs. Erickson’s novels revolve around concepts that appear in many of his works. One of them is slavery, both actual and metaphorical. ""Arc d'X"" begins with the story of the love affair between Thomas Jefferson and a slave girl, Sally Hemings. In a number of Erickson’s novels the selling, buying, owning and disowning of women appears; as often, the men are the more profoundly trapped by what they seek or purport to possess. In virtually all of his novels, the female protagonist is the catalytic figure who sets events into motion, particularly in ""The Sea Came in at Midnight"" and ""Our Ecstatic Days"" where female characters are dominant. Another important theme in Erickson's novels, particularly in ""Our Ecstatic Days"", is parenthood and the loss of a child. ""Our Ecstatic Days"" follows a mother's search for her missing son over the course of a quarter century. The Occupant from ""The Sea Came in at Midnight"" is left by his wife and child. In ""Days Between Stations"" Adolphe and Maurice Sarre are abandoned by their mother, and Lauren’s son Jules dies. The profound estrangement from his father of ""Zeroville""'s central character, Vikar, leads to his obsession with movies, and later he becomes a paternal figure to the teenage Zazi after her mother dies. In ""These Dreams of You"", the adoptive parents of the four-year-old Ethiopian orphan Sheba set out to find the girl's birth mother. Sometimes Erickson relies on autobiographical information filtered through an unconventional imagination. Erickson's narratives often take place in Los Angeles. ""Amnesiascope"" is almost a memoir in which actual people and events from Erickson’s life mix with his imagination. One recurring theme is filmmaking, presented from the perspective of a director (""Days Between Stations""), screenwriter (""Rubicon Beach""), critic (""Amnesiascope"") and film editor (""Zeroville""). Sometimes the films are transgressive, misunderstood and rejected by the audience. Some of Erickson's novels can be described as apocalyptic. They present the slow obliteration of the world in which his characters live. Often nature turns against people (the long winter in Paris, sand storms in L.A. and the disappearance of water in Venice and the Mediterranean region in ""Days Between Stations""; the earthquake in ""Amnesiascope""; the lake that floods L.A. in both ""Rubicon Beach"" and ""Our Ecstatic Days""). The characters of the novels usually live in metropoles: L.A., New York, Berlin, Paris or Tokyo, in which unexpected natural phenomena cause chaos and show how brittle civilization actually is. Erickson makes occasional use of somewhat supernatural elements such as bizarre artifacts (a bottle with human eyes from ""Days Between Stations"") and the extraordinary gifts of some of his characters (Catherine from ""Rubicon Beach""). The most powerful force of Erickson’s universe is love, often passionate, sensual, overpowering, unstoppable. Lovers hurt each other but at the same time cannot live without each other. When the love is lost, people become empty, bitter or full of hatred. The affection is almost like possession. Erickson’s characters often appear in multiple books. Adolphe Sarre from ""Days Between Stations"" comes back in ""Amnesiascope"" and is alluded to in ""Zeroville"". Lauren from ""Days Between Stations"" appears in ""Arc d'X"". Carl appears in ""Days Between Stations"", ""Tours of the Black Clock"", ""Amnesiascope"" and ""The Sea Came in at Midnight"". Lauren and Jeanine from ""Days Between Stations"" and Catherine and Leigh from ""Rubicon Beach"" are mentioned in ""Tours of the Black Clock"" as characters appearing in the mind of the latter book's protagonist. Wade and Mallory from ""Rubicon Beach"" emerge as major characters in ""Arc d’X"". Viv from ""Amnesiascope"" returns years later as the adoptive mother in search of her daughter's past in ""These Dreams of You"". Kristin features in both ""The Sea Came in at Midnight"" and ""Our Ecstatic Days"". Jainlight from ""Tours of the Black Clock"" reappears, in an altered incarnation but with the same name, in ""Our Ecstatic Days"". "
wikipedia-2297697," Kittatinny Mountains  The Kittatinny Mountains (Lenape: Kitahtëne) are a long ridge traversing across northwestern New Jersey running in a northeast-southwest axis. It is the first major ridge in the far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains, and reaches its highest elevation (the state's highest), 1,803 feet, at High Point in Montague Township. The second ridge is Wallpack Ridge which reaches its highest elevation at 928 feet above sea level. Geology. The name comes from a Lenape Native American word meaning ""endless hill"" or ""great mountain"". The highest peak in the range is High Point at , which is also the highest point in the state of New Jersey. This peak is located in High Point state park and has a road leading to the top. The second highest mountain is Sunrise Mountain, located within Stokes State Forest. The elevation here is and has a road leading almost to the top. At the top there is a shelter with a roof but no sides. The Kittatinny Mountain is of the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate which is mainly composed of quartz. Due to the hardness of the quartz, the mountain is extremely resistant to weathering. Around four hundred fifty million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America. The North American plate went under the chain of islands. The islands went on top of the edge of North America creating the Highlands and the Kittatinny Valley which is the Ordovician Martinsburg Shale. Quartz and other sedimentary conglomerate was transported to the inland sea, which was over part of the Martinsburg Shale. A small continent then collided with North America around four hundred million years ago. Geologic pressure resulted, which caused compression and then folding and faulting resulted. The folding ran perpendicular to the directional forces. During folding, intense heat melted silica which cemented the quartz and other stones together. Also the intense heat allowed the rock layers to bend, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born. Near the base of the west side of the mountain is the Silurian High Falls Formation, which is red and green shale and sandstone. The east side of the mountain near the base is of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation which contains slate, shale and sandstone. The top of the mountain has a fairly even elevation ranging between and . There are two exceptions. One is Culver's Gap, which was created by an ancient stream which was diverted and is now a wind gap. The base of Culver's Gap is at least below the top of the mountain. Culver's Gap is located near Culver's Lake, just west of Branchville. The second is a small gap in the mountain, south of Catfish Pond, which is north of the gap. This gap is about deep. Culver's Gap was a route used by Paleo Indians and the Lenape Native Americans to go through the mountain to trade and hunt. The second is a groove or depression in the mountain ridge near Catfish Pond. This is about deep as the base of the depression is and the top of the mountain at that place is . The top of the mountain ranges from 50 meters wide to nearly wide. West of the Kittatinny Mountain, at the northwestern end is the Port Jervis trough, also called the Minisink Valley. Next to the mountain on the western side is the Flatbrook Valley or Walpack Valley which runs from Steam Mill to Flatbrookville. From the Delaware Water Gap to the New York line is but the ridges continues into New York State where it is known as the Shawangunk Mountain. The ridge continues to nearly Kingston, New York. The Wisconsin glacier covered the entire mountain about 21,000 BC, and melted about 13,000 BC. The terminal moraine is located near Belvidere. The glacier has left end moraines, periglacial rock fields, and kettles, at the northern end of the mountain in Stokes State Forest. The area was a Tundra biome after the glacier melted and then became a Taiga biome as the climate warmed. At that time coniferous trees such as spruce and pine inhabited the area. The area warmed more around 8000 BC so oak, maple, birch, willow, and other deciduous trees began to grow. Paleo Indians. Paleo Indians inhabited the Delaware River Valley around 10,500 BC. after the Wisconsin Glacier melted. They hunted, fished and gathered plants to eat in the Delaware Valley and on Kittatinny Mountain. They had no permanent camps and traveled often in search of food. The area was coniferous and deciduous forests mixed with grasslands in the valleys. The Marshall Creek Mastodon found just north of the Gap was dated at 10,210BC ±180 years. Other big game existed at the time such as caribou and muskox. Native Americans. The Lenape Native Americans that came to the area two thousand years ago traveled on the mountain in search of plant foods and game. They collected acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts, beech nuts, chestnuts, and butternuts from the deciduous forest, and collected water from fresh streams. The Lenapes also hunted deer, elk, and bear on the mountain. Waterfalls, cliffs and lakes. There is one waterfall on the western side of the mountain known as Buttermilk Falls. This is about south of Route 206, in which a dirt road leads to the base of it. A wooden staircase has been built near it, so people can climb to the top. A second falls is seasonable during heavy rains next to Route 80 near the Big Cliffs. Water slides over the rocks and drops over a small ledge before going under Route 80. There are several cliffs on the mountain. The largest is located at the Delaware Water Gap. The cliff is up to high and starts at Route 80 and extends about 400 meters along the mountain The second largest cliff is located north of the Gap, on the eastern side. Small rock faces exist on the western face and eastern face along the mountain. The southeastern face of the mountain has a steeper pitch than the northwestern face. The top of the mountain has 14 lakes and ponds. Sunfish Pond, Catfish Pond, Mountain Ridge Lake, Blue Mountain Lake, Long Pine Pond, Lake Success, Crater Lake, Hemlock Lake, Kittatinny Lake, Steeny Kill Lake and Lake Marcia are some of them. Lake Marcia is the lake with the highest elevation on the mountain, (479 meters) above sea level. This lake is located in High Point State Park which is at the northern end of Kittatinny Mountain. Flora and fauna. The mountain is a northern deciduous forest of various oaks, hickories, maples, birches, walnut, elm, ash, birch, sycamore, cherry, beech, chestnut, and sweet gum. Wild blueberries and rhodendrum also grow on the mountain. Animals such as whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, gray fox, beaver, black bears as well as a large variety of birds inhabit the mountain. Turkey Vultures and Red Tail Hawks are also common. Fish such as trout, pickerel, and bass are also in the lakes. Mining. Copper mining began in the 1750s at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine, which is north of the Gap, off Old Mine Road.  This mine is located in the Silurian High Falls Formation on the west side of the mountain. This sandstone is very hard and made mining very difficult. The copper was between 2 to 3 percent in the ore which made mining unprofitable. Mining was done in the 1800s, by various companies which went bankrupt. The mine sold several times.  Silver mining began in the 1880s with John Snook digging a mine at the northern end and western face of the Kittatinny mountain in an area now known as Stokes State Forest. He extracted silver ore for a short time and the silver ore was depleted. The mine is now flooded with water. Kittatinny and Flatbrook Valleys. To the east of the Kittatinny Mountain, is the Great Kittatinny Valley. This is drained by the Paulinskill river in the south and the Wallkill River in the north. The Big Flatbrook drains the mountain on the northwestern end beginning at Steam mill swamp and flows in a southwesterly direction which drains into the Delaware River near Flatbrookville. This area is known as the Flatbrook Valley.  The Port Jervis trough is at the northwestern end of the mountain. The Delaware River flows near the mountain at the south end, finally cutting across the ridge at the Delaware Water Gap just south of Mount Tammany. The Kittatinnies are a far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. In Pennsylvania, the ridge forming the Kittatinnies becomes known as Blue Mountain and runs southwest for , nearly to Maryland. In Franklin County, Pennsylvania, however, a parallel ridge to Blue Mountain is named ""Kittatinny Mountain""; the Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels through both ridges (a very short distance apart) with the western tunnel named ""Kittatinny Mountain"" and the eastern one ""Blue Mountain."" To the north in New York, the ridge is known as the Shawangunk Mountains which goes to Kingston, New York. "
wikipedia-2297825," Ramming  In warfare, ramming is a technique that was used in air, sea and land combat. The term originated from battering ram, a siege weapon used to bring down fortifications by hitting it with the force of the ram's momentum. Thus, in warfare ramming refers to hitting a target by running oneself into the target. Today, hand-held battering rams are one tool among many used by law enforcement and military personnel for door breaching. Forcible entry by criminals has been implemented using such methods as vehicles rammed into buildings. Naval warfare. The ram was commonly used in antiquity, and was an important part of the armament of the galleys of Imperial Rome. The ancient Greeks used their trireme vessels for ramming as well. In ancient China, rams were largely unknown as the lack of a keel and the flat shape of the junk's bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur. The ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the American Civil War, at the battle of Hampton Roads, when the armoured Confederate warship ""Virginia"" rammed the Union frigate , sinking her almost immediately.  Another significant success of the ram in wartime was at the 1866 battle of Lissa, between Italy and Austria. The Italian ironclad ""Re d'Italia"" had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian ""Ferdinand Max"", the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral Tegetthoff. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank. During the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian ironclad ""Huáscar"" repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette ""Esmeralda"", sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship. During World War I, rammed and sunk German submarine . This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British luxury ocean liner RMS Olympic rammed SM U-103 in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to scuttle and abandon ship.  In World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed destroyers took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the Royal Navy from early 1943, after the was dry-docked for three months following sinking ""U-357"" in December 1942 and was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of ""U-444"" in March 1943. USS Buckley (DE-51) rammed U-66; and HMS Easton rammed U-458.  On 29 January 1943, the Japanese submarine I-1 was rammed and wrecked by the New Zealand naval trawlers, ""Kiwi"" and ""Moa"" in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, Guadalcanal during Operation Ke. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each.  On 5 November 1942, the Finnish submarine Vetehinen rammed the Soviet submarine Щ 305 in the Sea of Åland and sank it. Vetehinen was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact Vetehinen launched a torpedoes, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. Vetehinen then opened fire with its deck guns. Deck guns managed to damage the Soviet submarine which by now had started an emergency dive. The Captain of Vetehinen, determined not to let the submarine escape ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel which at last was a success. During anti-submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water. The tactic was used by the famous British anti-submarine specialist, Captain Frederic John Walker from December 1941 to the end of the war.  Superannuated British destroyer was disguised as a German ship for the purpose of ramming the lock gates of the U-boat base at St. Nazaire on 28 March 1942. A large explosive time bomb charge in the bow of the ship exploded the next day, putting the dock out of commission for five years. ""PT-109"" was rammed and crushed by a Japanese destroyer, though the incident was at night and the PT-boat was idling to avoid detection, making it doubtful the destroyer's actions were intentional. In 1988, two US naval ships, destroyer and cruiser , were lightly rammed by Soviet Mirka II class light frigate (FFL 824) and Burevestnik class frigate ""Bezzavetny"" (FFG 811) inside contested Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, near the port of Foros. None of the ships involved suffered significant damage. During the ""Cod Wars"" between Britain and Iceland, unarmed fishing trawlers found themselves opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as Royal Navy coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, ocean-going tugs and lightships to protect them and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences. Air warfare. Ramming in air combat is a last-ditch tactic that was used when all else had failed. The ramming pilot could use his entire aircraft as a ram or he could try to destroy the enemy's controls using the propeller or wing to chop into the enemy's tail or wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition yet was still eager to destroy an enemy, or when his plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most ramming occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as by pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones or by single-engine aircraft against multiple-engine bombers. Defenders rammed more often than invaders. A ramming attack was not considered suicidal in the same manner as ""kamikaze"" attacks—the ramming pilot stands a chance of surviving, though it was very risky. Sometimes the ramming aircraft itself could survive to make a controlled landing, though most were lost due to combat damage or the pilot bailing out. Ramming was used in air warfare in the first half of the 20th century, in both World Wars and in the interwar period. In the jet age, as air combat speeds increased, ramming became obsolete—the probability of successfully executing (and surviving) a ramming attack approached impossibility. Ground warfare. Already in 750 BCE, the main striking force of the Assyrian army was the corps of horse-drawn, two-wheeled chariots. Their mission was to smash their way through the ranks of enemy infantry. During World War II, the tanks crews would sometimes use their own vehicles to run over enemy positions (personnel, artillery etc.) instead of firing upon it. This tactic was especially popularised in Soviet Union. Facing the German Tiger or Panther tanks, the crewmen of T-34 tanks, who lacked the firepower to break their thick armour, sometimes preferred to use the speed and manouverability of their tanks to drive straight into Germans, gambling that the impact will break the enemy's tracks and immobilize it. Moreover, the attack could end with jamming the Tiger's turret, either by blocking it with T-34's own body or by damaging the turret's drive, eliminating the risk to the remaining Soviet units. However there was a serious risk of being destroyed by German guns before reaching the enemy tanks. In addition, sometimes (especially if the T-34 ran into the enemy's back), the ramming would rupture a Tiger's or a Panther's fuel tank and cause a fire, destroying both vehicles. "

wikipedia-2297841," Batou  While his name is officially romanized as ""Batou"", in some copies of the first film's subtitles and credits, it is spelled ""Bateau"" (the French word for ""boat""). Personality. Shirow's characterization of Batou in the manga, and indeed the other members of Section 9, is notably more light-hearted than the characterization used in Mamoru Oshii's films of the same name. He frequently jokes with Motoko, Togusa, the Tachikomas, and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cyber-criminal named Koil Krasnov. Batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up Section 9 Chief Aramaki, demanding an explanation for Yano's death, then storms off announcing (in the English translation), ""That…Koil is dead meat!"" Batou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make Section 9 fix the mess of another organization, such as the AI hijacking of the Jigabachi choppers in the SAC series. However in the Ghost in the Shell movie he appears more stoic and silent than his TV and Manga counterpart. Particularly in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, Batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter.Saito: ""Batou! It's okay. I'm used to it."" (Bandai, English) -  In addition, he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned. Appearances. Manga. Batou originally appeared in the manga authored by Masamune Shirow, serialized in Kodansha's """"Young Magazine Pirate Edition"""" from 1989 to 1991. Unlike ""S.A.C."", where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-C.I.A. operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress varies considerably over the series' run. In """", Batou makes only a cameo appearance, and is hardly recognizable. His head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, ""Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,"" to which Batou remarks, ""A persimmon maybe?"" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an ultimatum: ""If you can't be serious you can leave the room."" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the Puppet Master, but his request is denied. Films. The portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. In ""Ghost in the Shell"" and its sequel, """", Batou is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. He is depicted having a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. In the films, as in the anime series, Batou is voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese and Richard Epcar in the English dubbed versions. Batou is the central character of ""Innocence"", which centers around his reaction to the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in ""Innocence"" is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the ""Innocence"" DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a Basset Hound named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of Togusa and his family. Ishikawa, Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major, however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.  After shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched prosthetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other ""Ghost in the Shell"" incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a ""Jericho 942,"" based on the real Jericho 941 made by IMI but chambered for .50AE. In ""Innocence"", he is also seen with a compact S&W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The ""Innocence"" prequel novel, ""After the Long Goodbye,"" notes that Batou's S&W pistol is chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge. ""Stand Alone Complex"" series. In ', Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film ' more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous. Batou had served in a military special forces unit and often states that he was a Ranger with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his cybernetic body has little to gain from exercise, Batou often lifts weights and jogs. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts, and is widely regarded as the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, whom he later spars with while undercover on a mission. Batou is the favorite superior of the Tachikomas, because he regularly showers them with care and affection (in episode 2.15 it is also apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer). He has even dubbed one as his ""personal"" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with organic oil, both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the Tachikomas' AI starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, as Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI. Batou is often seen driving a yellow Lancia Stratos coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car, and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa uses Batous' love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In ""Solid State Society"", Batou drives a yellow Ford GT with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that ""his tastes had changed."" Design. ""Stand Alone Complex"" character designer Hajime Shimomura said that Batou's image was based on the Minotaur. The name ""Batou"" also means ""eight-headed"" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since ""Kusanagi"" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.

wikipedia-2297876," Michele Ferrari  Michele Ferrari (born 26 March 1953) is an Italian physician, cycling coach and author. On 10 July 2012 the United States Anti-Doping Agency issued Ferrari a lifetime sports ban for numerous anti-doping violations including possession, trafficking, administration and assisting doping. Biography. Ferrari was born in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, where he still lives.  In 1978, he obtained his degree in Medicine and Surgery at the University of Ferrara. His doctoral thesis concerned the measurement of anaerobic threshold in the sport of running. Ferrari was a consultant to the Italian Track and Field Federation (FIDAL) from 1977 to 1980. He became a specialist in sports medicine at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1981. He was co-author of more than 20 papers in journals of sports physiology. He studied parameters of athletes in a variety of sports, such as track and field, cycling, swimming, skiing, and speed-skating. Subsequently, until 1983, he was the sports physician of the National Italian Biathlon team (FISI). Eventually he settled on his lifelong interest in the development of training programmes for professional cyclists. One of Ferrari's earliest successes was coaching Francesco Moser to achieve the hour record in 1984, crushing the great Eddy Merckx's mark by more than a mile.  Initially Ferrari worked with Prof. Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara, who developed testing techniques for human performance, using methods such as monitoring the heart rate during exercise and recovery. Another controversial Italian doctor, Luigi Cecchini, is their common disciple. They have shared the care for some cyclists throughout their careers.  From 1984 onwards Ferrari achieved extraordinary improvements in the fitness of many cyclists. Ferrari popularised the use of VAM, a parameter now used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed. Cycling team doctor and increasing prominence. In 1994, Ferrari was the team doctor for Gewiss. The team had an excellent season, winning many races. In the Flèche Wallonne, the team realized a historic triple victory. Concerned by the domination of the Italian team, some observers pointed a finger of suspicion at the team doctor. Far from calming this controversy, Ferrari compared erythropoietin to orange juice. ""EPO is not dangerous, it's the abuse that is. It's also dangerous to drink 10 liters of orange juice"". This statement cost him his job as team physician. But his reputation was made, and his name thereafter was associated with use of EPO in particular. In 1995, Ferrari started his own private medical practice. Clientele. Professional bicycle racers who were clients, in some capacity, of Ferrari include: Lance Armstrong, Michael Rogers, Alexander Vinokourov, Michele Scarponi, Denis Menchov, Giovanni Visconti, Yaroslav Popovych, Alessandro Bertolini, Gianluca Bortolami, Gianni Bugno, Mario Cipollini, Claudio Chiappucci, Cadel Evans, Armand de Las Cuevas, Fernando Escartín, Gianni Faresin, Giorgio Furlan, Ivan Gotti, Andreas Kappes, Kevin Livingston, Eddy Mazzoleni, Axel Merckx, Thomas Dekker, Abraham Olano, Daniele Pontoni, Tony Rominger, Paolo Savoldelli, Filippo Simeoni, Pavel Tonkov, Enrico Zaina and Beat Zberg. Perhaps the most famous athlete to have been coached or advised by Ferrari is Lance Armstrong. Ferrari claims they were introduced to each other by Eddy Merckx in 1995. Ferrari was involved with the US Postal Service Cycling Team until October 2004, helping Armstrong train during several of his seven consecutive Tour de France victories. Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's teammate who later confessed to doping, worked with Ferrari for one year, according to his own account in a television interview. Sporting fraud trial. In October 2004, Michele Ferrari was sentenced to one year prison (suspended) and a fine of 900 euros, for sporting fraud and abusive exercise of the profession of pharmacist.  Ferrari's conviction in Italian court was based partly on testimony from Italian bicycle racer Filippo Simeoni. Admitting he had been doped since 1993, Simeoni told how he became affiliated with Ferrari in 1996. Simeoni testified that, in addition to a prescription of EPO hormone, ""we spoke about Andriol (testosterone), which I was to use after hard training sessions, with the aim of increasing my muscular power. Dr. Ferrari recommended I use Emagel the morning before controls, and another product to decrease my hematocrit."". Ferrari argued, in his defense: ""Andriol is easily detectable for several days in a normal urine test, so, it is impossible that I suggested he take one Andriol 20 hours before another race."" Lance Armstrong responded to Ferrari's guilty verdict for malpractice in the Italian Court case: Ferrari then announced his intention to appeal his sentence. Ferrari was acquitted of all charges against him on May 27, 2006, because, according to the court, ""the facts do not exist"" to support the charges. 2012 USADA indictment and lifetime ban. On 13 June 2012, Ferrari was officially charged by USADA with administration and trafficking of prohibited substances. As Ferrari did not formally contest this indictment, he was issued a lifetime ban from professional sport in July 2012. In December 2012, Ferrari still protested his innocence in an interview with Al Jazeera. He notably stated about Lance Armstrong in that interview: “So, either he was clean – and in my opinion, he was clean and he says he was clean – or the tests are not powerful,” Ferrari added, before laughing: “Or the UCI was corrupt.” In January of 2013, after Lance Armstrong had confessed to using PEDs, Ferrari claimed on his blog that the cyclist could have achieved similar blood values and performance with altitude training.

wikipedia-2297909," Antiestablishmentarianism  Antiestablishmentarianism (or anti-establishmentarianism) is a policy that views a nation's or society's power structure as corrupt, repressive, exploitive or unjust. Antiestablishmentarians adhere to the doctrine of opposition to the social and political establishment. Their purpose is to subvert from within. This doctrine holds that establishments lose connection with the people and have their own agendas which frequently destroy the things they blindly don't address. Antiestablishmentarianism has ties to anarchism but should not be confused with antifederalism or antifeudalism. In a country with an established religion (e.g. England), ""antiestablishmentarianism"" can mean support for the end of the special status of the established religion. In the 19th century, some English people opposed a movement to ""disestablish"" as the church exclusively recognized by the government as the official religion of the country. That countermovement was antidisestablishmentarianism. Antidisestablishmentarianism is usually cited as the longest word in the English language, but according to some definitions it is exceeded by many others. Modern day use. The modern use of the anti-establishment label became widespread in the 1960s.  The mindset this label describes prospered under the anxiety and frustration/anger with the United States government during the Vietnam war, as well as many other national governments during a similar time frame. Anxiety over the draft led to doubts concerning the implicit purpose of the war effort, and the moral legitimacy of that implicit purpose. The same attitude of doubt and independent moral scrutiny was, during this time period, applied to many established institutions of the day: race relations, gender relations, sexuality, cultural norms, musical creativity, drugs and drug prohibition, as well as various socio-economic concerns.  In this connotation, the phrase has at times been applied retroactively to historical phenomena that occurred before the 1960s; for example, the attitudes of both the German Nazi and Communist parties in the early 1930s; or the American radical movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Hungry Generation. In India the group of writers and painters during 1960s who called themselves Hungryalists are the most important contributors to antiestablishment literature. "
wikipedia-2297912," Mueller calculus  Mueller calculus is a matrix method for manipulating Stokes vectors, which represent the polarization of light. It was developed in 1943 by Hans Mueller, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In this technique, the effect of a particular optical element is represented by a Mueller matrix—a 4×4 matrix that is a generalization of the Jones matrix. Light which is unpolarized or partially polarized must be treated using Mueller calculus, while fully polarized light can be treated with either Mueller calculus or the simpler Jones calculus. Many problems involving coherent light (such as from a laser) must be treated with Jones calculus, because it works with amplitude rather than intensity of light, and retains information about the phase of the waves.  Any fully polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized state of light can be represented by a Stokes vector . Any optical element can be represented by a Mueller matrix (M). If a beam of light is initially in the state formula_1 and then passes through an optical element M and comes out in a state formula_2, then it is written If a beam of light passes through optical element M1 followed by M2 then M3 it is written given that matrix multiplication is associative it can be written Matrix multiplication is not commutative, so in general Below are listed the Mueller matrices for some ideal common optical elements: "

wikipedia-2297943," Pushkar Lake  Pushkar Lake or Pushkar Sarovar () is located in the town of Pushkar in Ajmer district of the Rajasthan state of western India. Pushkar Lake is a sacred lake of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures describe as it as ""Tirtha-Raj"" – the king of pilgrimage sites related to a water-body and relate it to the mythology of the creator-god Brahma, whose most prominent temple stands in Pushkar. The Pushkar Lake finds mention on coins as early as the 4th century BC. Pushkar Lake is surrounded by 52 bathing ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, especially around Kartik Poornima (October–November) when the Pushkar Fair is held. A dip in the sacred lake is believed to cleanse sins and cure skin diseases. Over 500 Hindu temples are situated around the lake precincts. Tourism and deforestation in the surroundings have taken a heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme. Geography. Pushkar Lake around which the Pushkar town has developed is in the Ajmer district in the state of Rajasthan, India amidst the Aravalli range of hills. The mountain range known as ""Nag Parbat"" (""snake mountain"") separates the lake from the city of Ajmer. The valley is formed between the two parallel ranges of the Aravalli hills (in elevation range of running south-west to north-east. Situated at northwest from Ajmer, the artificial Pushkar Lake created by building a dam is surrounded by deserts and hills on all three sides. The lake is categorized as a ""Sacred Lake"" under the list of ""Classification of Lakes in India"". The soil and topography in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use pattern in the Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30% of the area under shifting sand dunes, 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural. Climate. The region experiences semi-arid climatic conditions with dry and hot summers and cool winters. The summer months of May and June are the hottest, with a maximum temperature of around . During the winter months, the maximum mean temperature is in the range of . Rain mainly occurs during a short spell of two months during July and August. The recorded average rainfall is in the range of . Rainfall is also recorded some times during winter months of January and February. From April to September, strong winds blowing in the southwest to northeast direction add to the formation of sand dunes. Hydrology. The Pushkar Lake drains a catchment of the Aravalli hills covering an area of . The lake has a water surface area of . It is a perennial lake sourced by the monsoon rainfall over the catchment. The depth of water in the lake varies from season to season from . The total storage capacity of the lake is 0.79 million cubic metres (1.03 million cu yd). As the lake periphery is encircled by 52 ghats of various sizes, the surface water flow from the catchment into the lake is channelled through a series of arches under a foot bridge, long at the southern end. The foot bridge facilitates the ""parikrama"" (circumambulation) that is performed by pilgrims around the lake covering all the 52 ghats (covers an area of ). Flora and fauna. Pushkar Lake, when full, is rich in fish and other aquatic life. The depth of the lake has substantially shrunk – to less than from a maximum of – resulting in the death of large fish weighing , caused due to the viscous water and the lack of oxygen for the fish to survive. Since the region where the lake and its valley is situated is arid, the flora and fauna recorded relate to desert plants, including cactus and thorny bushes, as well as desert animals like camels and cattle. Man-eating crocodiles used to be a menace in the Puskhar Lake, resulting in the deaths of people. Pilgrims were aware of this fact, yet many considered it as lucky to be eaten by crocodiles. The crocodiles were caught with nets by the British and shifted to a nearby reservoir. History. Pushkar Lake's history dates back to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The inscriptions found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route. In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveller Fa Xian made reference to the number of visitors to Pushkar Lake. A story tells of a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parikar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was astonished to see that the Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems. The creation of Pushkar Lake, as an artificial lake, is also credited to the 12th century when a dam was built across the headwaters of the Luni River. The 10th Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh (1666–1708), is said to have recited the Sikh sacred text ""Guru Granth Sahib"" on the banks of the lake. During the Mughal rule, there was a short break in the lake's importance due to the levy of a pilgrim tax and a ban on religious processions. In 1615–16, the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) built his hunting lodge (seen now in total ruins) on the shores of the Pushkar Lake to celebrate his victory over the local Rajput Rana (king). He came to this lodge 16 times for hunting during his stay in Ajmer, about from Pushkar. This act violated the local tradition of not killing any animals in the precincts of the sacred lake. He also committed an idolatrous act by breaking the image of Varaha – the boar Avatar of the god Vishnu, as it resembled a pig and symbolically hurt Islamic sensitivity. Thereafter, Jahangir's grandson emperor Aurangzeb (1618–1707) destroyed and desecrated several temples, which were later rebuilt. However, during the rule of Jahangir's father, Emperor Akbar (1542–1605), there was a revival of not only the lake but also the Ajmer's Dargah dedicated to sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti, of whom Akbar was a devout follower. The Rajput rulers of Amber, Bundi, Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts to restore the importance of the lake and its surrounding temples. Credits given for modern additions to the building of ghats and the renovation/construction of temples go to Maharaja Man Singh I of Amber for the Raj Ghat and Man temple; Rana Pratap for the Varaha temple; Daulat Rao Scindia for Kot Tirth Ghat, the Marathas-Anaji Scindia to the Koteshwar Mahadev temple and Govind Rao, the Maratha governor of Ajmer for Shiva Ghat; to the British rule for combining the religious pilgrimage with a cattle fair to generate taxes for improving the lake and its surroundings; and gifting of the Jaipur Ghat and the Main Palace on the ghat in 1956 by the Maharaja of Jaipur. Religious significance. There are various legends from Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata and the Puranic scriptures which mention the Pushar Lake and the town of Pushkar surrounding it. According to the Hindu scripture ""Padma Purana"", Brahma saw the demon Vajranabha (Vajranash in another version) trying to kill his children and harassing people. He immediately slew the demon with his weapon, the lotus-flower. In this process, the lotus petals fell on the ground at three places, where springs emerged creating three lakes: the Pushkar Lake or Jyeshta Pushkar (greatest or first Pushkar), the Madya Pushkar (middle Pushkar) Lake, and Kanishta Pushkar (lowest or youngest Pushkar) lake. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the flower (""pushpa"") fell from Brahma's hand (""kar"") as ""Pushkar"". It is also said that the sacred Sarasvati River emerged at Pushkar as five streams. The three lakes were assigned their presiding deities as the Hindu Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, respectively. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the lotus fell as 'Pushkar'. Brahma then decided to perform a yagna at the place, at the main Pushkar Lake. However, his wife Savitri (called Sarasvati in some versions) could not be present at the designated time to perform the essential part of the yagna. Brahma, therefore, married a Gujjar,a dominant agricultural race named Gayatri and completed the yagna with his new consort sitting beside him. However, when Savitri finally arrived at the venue, she found Gayatri sitting next to Brahma in her rightful place. Agitated, she cursed Brahma that he would be worshipped only in Pushkar. As a result of this, yagna performed in the presence of all the gods, it is said that a dip in the lake created at this place is credited with holiness, assuring salvation from all sins. It is now one of the five holiest centres of pilgrimage for Hindus. Ramayana and Mahabharata refer to Pushkar Lake as ""Adi Tirtha"", or the ""original sacred water-body"". The famous Sanskrit poet and play-writer Kalidasa also referred to this lake in his poem Abhijñānaśākuntalam. The Ramayana mentions that Vishwamitra performed penance at Pushkar Lake for a thousand years. In spite of Brahma appearing before him and granting him the higher status of a rishi instead of a royal-sage (""rajarishi""), Vishwamitra continued his penance, but, the celestial nymph apsara, Menaka came to the lake to take a bath. Vishwamitra was enamoured by her beauty and they decided to live together in pursuit of pleasure for ten years. Then, Vishwamitra realized that his main activity of penance was disturbed. He, therefore, took leave of Menaka and went away to the north to continue his meditation. Vishwamitra was also described as building the Brahma temple at Pushkar after Brahma's yagna. Mahabharata mentions that Pushkar is a holy place of the god Vishnu, considered as the Adi Tirtha where millions of tirthas united during sunrise and sunset, and visiting the lake and taking a holy bath in the lake would wash off all sins. According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes collectively called ""Panch-Sarovar"" ('Sarovar' means ""lake""). Namely, Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar; hence, Pushkar is considered one of the most sacred places in India. It is also the belief of devotees that a dip in the waters of the lake on Kartik Poornima would equal the benefits that would accrue by performing yagnas (fire-sacrifices) for several centuries. Pushkar is often called ""Tirtha-Raj"" – the king of pilgrimage sites related to water-bodies. The scriptures also mention that doing parikrama (circumambulation) of the three lakes (the main Pushkar, Madya Pushkar where there is a Hanuman temple and an old Banyan tree, and Kanistha Pushkar where a Krishna temple exists), which cover a distance of , during the Kartik Poornima day would be highly auspicious. ""International Business Times"" has identified Pushkar as one of the ten most religious places in the world and one of the five sacred pilgrimage places for the Hindus, in India. Cultural attractions. Pushkar Lake and its precincts offer a plethora of monuments of national importance, such as the Pushkar city, the Brahma temple at Pushkar and the ghats on the periphery of the lakes. The lake is the central divine theme for the popularity of all the monuments seen in the town and the fairs held here. Pushkar city. Pushkar city, with a population of 14,791 as of the 2001 census, is one of the oldest cities in India. The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a ""darshan"" (sight) of god Vishnu. Thus, its uniqueness lies in the fact of its historic-religious-cultural background, and as a result it attracts approximately 100,000 visitors every month, apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair. However, the Pushkar Lake is central to its sustenance as a religious centre. The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16.12 million (said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan), out of which the foreign tourists were about 63,000. Temples. Apart from the sacred Lake, Pushkar is said to have over 500 temples (80 are large and the rest are small); of these many old temples were destroyed or desecrated by Muslim depredations during Aurangzeb's rule (1658–1707) but were re-built subsequently. The most important of these is the Brahma temple. Though the current structure dates to the 14th century, the original temple is believed to be 2000 years old. Pushkar is often described in the scriptures as the only Brahma temple in the world, owing to the curse of Savitri, but also as the ""King of the sacred places of the Hindus"". Although now the Pushkar temple does not remain the only Brahma temple, it is still one of very few existing temples dedicated to Brahma in India as well as the most prominent. Hindu pilgrims, including holy men and sages visit this temple after taking a ceremonial sacred bath in the Pushkar Lake. Other notable temples around the lake include Varaha temple – dedicated to Varaha (the boar incarnation of god Vishnu), Savitri temple and Gayatri temple, dedicated to the consorts of Brahma. Ghats. Ghats (stone steps laid on a gradual bank slope to descend to the lake edge) at Pushkar are integral to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats on the periphery of the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument) have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further improvements as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power. While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (""Varaha""). Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display. A coinage known as ""Puskar Passport"" used by visitors to the lake and the ghats denotes the red thread that is tied on the wrists of pilgrims by the priests (for a dakshina – an unspecified fee). This indicates that the pilgrim has visited Pushkar Lake and is usually not approached by priests again for further rites and fees. Pushkar Fair. Pushkar Lake and its precincts become very heavily populated during the annual Pushkar Fair or ""Pushkar mela"", which has both a religious as well as an economic aspect. During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October–November), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair. The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels. In this fair held on the banks of the lake, camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake. Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes. The fair on Kartik Poornima, the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake. It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan. The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances, music, camel races and the cattle fair. The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair. This event is held between the Rajasthanis and foreigners; locals invariably win the event. Status and conservation issues. The natural environment of Pushkar Lake and its precincts has become increasingly degraded in the last few decades. The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the deforestation of the surrounding area. The critical issues related to the conservation of the lake have been identified as: In recent years, storage in the Pushkar Lake has been reduced alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the situation became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks near one of the upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake. Water quality issues. The lake does not meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high concentration of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation. Restoration works. To supplement water supply to the lake, even as early as in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water supply to the lake. However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake on a list of five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased. Development plans are under various stages of implementation to address the critical issues related to the lake. They aim to improve water quality, increase water storage capacity, prevent encroachment of the lake periphery, improve the ambience around the lake, as well as to introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes. Sewage outfalls into the lake are proposed to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders into the lake and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation in the bed of feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation to reduce the risk of death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.

""longifolia"" L., ""M. sylvestris"" L., ""M. tomentosa"" D'Urv, ""M. incana"" Willd.) is a species in the genus ""Mentha"" (mint) native to Europe, western and central Asia (east to Nepal and the far west of China), and northern and southern (but not tropical) Africa. It is a very variable herbaceous perennial plant with a peppermint-scented aroma. Like many mints, it has a creeping rhizome, with erect to creeping stems 40–120 cm tall. The leaves are oblong-elliptical to lanceolate, 5–10 cm long and 1.5–3 cm broad, thinly to densely tomentose, green to greyish-green above and white below. The flowers are 3–5 mm long, lilac, purplish, or white, produced in dense clusters (verticillasters) on tall, branched, tapering spikes; flowering in mid to late summer. It spreads via rhizomes to form clonal colonies. There are seven subspecies: It has been widely confused with tomentose variant plants of ""Mentha spicata""; it can be distinguished from these by the hairs being simple unbranched, in contrast to the branched hairs of ""M. spicata"". Like almost all mints, ""Mentha longifolia"" can be invasive. Care needs to be taken when planting it in non-controlled areas. "
wikipedia-2284275," Republic of Korea Navy  The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN; ; Hanja: 大韓民國 海軍; Revised Romanization: ""Daehanminguk Haegun""), also known as the ROK Navy, is the naval warfare service branch of the South Korean armed forces, responsible for conducting naval operations and amphibious landing operations. The ROK Navy includes the Republic of Korea Marine Corps, which is a quasi-autonomous organization. The ROK Navy is the oldest branch of the South Korean armed forces, and celebrated its 65th anniversary in 2010. Since the Korean War, the ROK Navy concentrated its efforts to build naval forces to counteract the North Korean navy, which has littoral naval capabilities. As South Korea's economy grew, the ROK Navy was able to build larger and better equipped fleets to deter aggression, to protect national maritime rights and to support the nation's foreign policies. As a part of its mission, the ROK Navy has engaged in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century. The ROK Navy has about 68,000 regular personnel including 27,000 Republic of Korea Marines (as of 2010). There are about 170 commissioned ships (with a total displacement of about 181,000 tons ) in the ROK Navy, including some 20 destroyers and frigates, 12 submarines, 100 corvettes and fast attack craft as of 2011. The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The ROK Marine Corps has about 400 tracked vehicles including self-propelled artillery. The ROK Navy aims to become a blue-water navy by 2020. Duties and objectives. The objectives of the ROK Navy as maritime forces for the National Security are: History. Origins. Korea has a long history of naval activity. In the late 4th century during the Three Kingdoms Period, Goguryeo defeated Baekjae, fielding amphibious forces of 40,000 men in the process. In the 9th century, Commissioner Chang Bogo of Unified Silla established a maritime base called Cheonghaejin on an island to foster trading with China and Japan, and to cope with pirates. In 1380, naval forces of the Goryeo Dynasty defeated 500 invading Japanese pirate vessels by deploying shipboard guns, devised by Choi Moosun. This is reportedly the first use of shipboard guns in naval history. In 1389 and 1419, Korean naval forces invaded Tsushima Island to suppress Japanese piracy. In the early years of the Joseon Dynasty, the naval force reached its peak of 50,000 personnel, in order to combat the ongoing piracy issue. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the Korean naval force commanded by Admiral Yi Sunshin, who later became the head of the Navy, cut off the invaders' naval lifeline and defeated the Japanese fleet, reversing the war in favor of Joseon. Admiral Yi is also credited with the creation of the Turtle Ship. By the end of 19th century, the Joseon Navy had no significant naval force other than coastal defense fortresses. Although there was an attempt to modernize the navy by establishing a royal naval school, the Joseon Navy was brought to an end in 1895. In 1903, the government of the Korean Empire purchased its first modern war ship, the ""Yangmu"". Korean naval tradition was disrupted after Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. During the Japanese occupation period, the Imperial Japanese Navy built a naval base - Chinkai Guard District in southern Korea (at present-day Jinhae). Founding years and Korean War. Shortly after Korea was liberated from the Empire of Japan on August 15, 1945, Sohn Won-yil, a former merchant mariner and son of the independence activist Sohn Jung-do, led the Maritime Affairs Association, which evolved into the Marine Defense Group on November 11, 1945 (later became Navy Foundation Day) and later became the Korean Coast Guard, which was formed in Jinhae. After the new Republic of Korea government was established on August 15, 1948, the Korean Coast Guard was formally renamed the Republic of Korea Navy, and Sohn became the first Chief of Naval Operations of the ROK Navy on September 5, 1948. On April 15, 1949, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC) was founded in Jinhae. In October 1949, the ROK Navy purchased a 600-ton submarine chaser, the former , on the American civil market with funds raised among its personnel. She was renamed ROKS ""Baekdusan"" (PC 701) (PC-701 백두산, named after Baekdu Mountain), and became ""the first significant warship of the newly independent nation"". The Korean War started with the North Korean army's surprise attack on Sunday, June 25, 1950. The ROK Navy confronted threats from the North Korean navy: ""Perhaps the most aggressive and effective, if smallest, member of the South Korean armed services during the first year of the Korean War was the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN). At the outset of the conflict, the 6,956-man ROKN, with ""6·25전쟁 발발 당일, 우리 해군의 함정 척수 및 병력"". 해군 vol. 2003 9-10. Republic of Korea Navy. Retrieved October 21, 2007. naval vessels of various types, was outnumbered by the 13,700 men and 110 naval vessels of the North Korean navy."" With its UN allies, dominated by U.S. forces, the ROK Navy was able to gain control in the seas surrounding the country. On July 27, 1953, the three year-long war was brought to an end when an armistice agreement was signed. During the war, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Philippines, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States contributed naval vessels as UN allies; Denmark sent the hospital ship ""Jutlandia"". Commander-in-Chief Republic of Korea Fleet, the highest operational command, was established in September 1953. Building the Navy. Starting in the 1950s, the ROK Navy built up its surface fleet mainly with older warships transferred from the United States Navy. In May 1963, the ROK Navy acquired its first destroyer ROKS ""Chungmu"" (DD 91 and later DD 911), the former , a ""Fletcher"" class destroyer. Starting from 1972, nine former USN ""Allen M. Sumner"" class and ""Gearing"" class destroyers were transferred and added to the ROK Fleet inventory. During the Vietnam War, the ROK Navy dispatched a naval transport squadron called ""Baekgu"", which was composed of 3 LSTs and 2 LSMs. The Republic of Korea Marine Corps sent into a combat brigade called ""Cheongnyong"" to Vietnam. On January 19, 1967, ROKS ""Dangpo"" (PCEC 56), the former USS Marfa (PCE-842), was sunk by North Korean coastal artillery north of the demarcation line off the east coast of Korea In June 1970, a navy broadcast vessel (ROKS ""I-2"") was captured by North Korean patrol craft in the vicinity of Yeonpyeong Islands in the West Sea (Yellow Sea). In the 70s, the ROK Navy, through the Park Chung-hee Administration's """"Yulgok"" Plan"" (an eight-year national defense plan ""to build up self-reliant, national defense capability""), began to build naval forces with indigenous technology; this initiated the ROK Navy effort to build a fleet of locally built ships. The first 2,000-ton frigate ROKS ""Ulsan"" (FF 951) was launched in 1980 and the first 1,000-ton corvette ROKS ""Pohang"" (PCC 756) was launched in 1982, both featuring indigenous technology. The ROK Navy continued to carry out other new shipbuilding projects such as mine sweepers, logistic support ships and amphibious landing ships in the 80s and 90s. In 1973, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps, once a separate branch of the armed forces, became a part of the Navy. Modernizing the Navy. Since the 90s, the ROK Navy has been steadily upgrading its naval forces. In 1995, Admiral An Pyongtae, the Chief of Naval Operations, presented his plan for the future of the ROK Navy, which included building a blue-water navy. As a part of a plan to strengthen the surface combatant forces, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship of the ""Gwanggaeto the Great"" class destroyer in 1996 to replace the former U.S. Navy destroyers. For building up a submarine force, the ROK Navy purchased its first submarine (other than midget submarines), the ""Chang Bogo"" (SS 061), from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft of Germany in 1992. In order to replace its antiquated S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare airplanes, South Korea purchased a squadron of P-3C ""Orion"" maritime patrol aircraft. These were delivered to the ROK Navy starting in 1995. Establishment of a regional navy. The ROK Navy continues to put its efforts to build a blue-water navy. In 2001, then-President Kim Dae-jung announced a plan for building up the Strategic Mobile Fleet. In 2002, the lead ship (ROKS ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" (DDH-975)) of the 5,500-ton ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" class destroyer was launched. In 2005, the 18,800-ton amphibious landing ship, ROKS ""Dokdo"" (LPH 6111) was launched. In 2006, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship (SS 072) of the 1,800-ton ""Sohn Wonyil"" class submarine, which was named after the first Chief of Naval Operations, equipped with an Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) system. In May 2007, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship (DDG 991) of the 11,000-ton ""Sejong the Great"" class destroyer, built around the American-made AEGIS combat system and the SPY-1D(v) multi-function phased array radar. As a part of its mission, the ROK Navy participated in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century. On March 26, 2010, ROKS ""Cheonan"", a ""Pohang"" class corvette was sunk by a North Korean torpedo, resulting in death of 46 sailors near Baengnyeong Island, in the vicinity of the Northern Limit Line (NLL). Command and organization. The Republic of Korea Navy includes the Republic of Korea Navy Headquarters, Republic of Korea Fleet, Republic of Korea Marine Corps, Naval Education and Training Command, Naval Logistics Command, and Naval Academy. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is the highest-ranking officer of the ROK Navy. Senior leadership. As of November 2011, the following people were in office: Organization. Republic of Korea Navy Headquarters. The ROK Navy is led by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). The Republic of Korea Navy Headquarters located within the Gyeryongdae complex, the tri-service headquarters in Gyeryong, includes the office of the Chief of Naval Operations and various agencies and staff functions. The CNO is a four-star admiral and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CNO oversees the administration of recruiting, organizing, training, equipping, supplying, and mobilizing the ROK Navy. Republic of Korea Fleet. Commander-in-Chief Republic of Korea Fleet (; CINCROKFLT) is responsible for naval operations, and based at Busan Naval Operations Base with a command headquarters. CINCROKFLT also serves as Commander Naval Component Command (CNCC) of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command (CFC) in peacetime, or as the Deputy Commander Combined Naval Component Command (DCCNCC) in wartime. The Republic of Korea Fleet has three numbered fleets each assigned to the seas east, west, and south of South Korea: For various types of naval operations, the ROK Navy has two surface flotillas, a naval aviation force, a submarine flotilla, special warfare (UDT/SEAL) forces, and a training squadron under the command of the CINCROKFLT: As a part of ""Defense Reform 2020,"" which was proposed by the Roh Moo-hyun Administration, the ROK Navy has been directed to reform its submarine operations command into a fleet submarine force. Numbered fleets. The three numbered fleets, each led by a Rear Admiral (Upper Half), are responsible for protecting the green-water around South Korea: The First Fleet is for the eastern naval sector, the Second Fleet is for the western naval sector and the Third Fleet is for the southern naval sector including Jeju Island. Each fleet mainly includes squadrons of patrol forces composed of ""Kwanggaeto the Great"" class destroyers, ""Ulsan"" class frigates, ""Pohang"" class corvettes and ""Chamsuri"" class patrol boats. Mobile Task Flotilla. When taking command of the Navy in 1995, Admiral An Pyongtae, then Chief of Naval Operations, proposed to build a blue-water navy for the Republic of Korea. In the year 2001, President Kim Dae-jung announced a plan for creating a task force called ""strategic maneuver fleet"" (전략기동함대; ""Jeollyak Gidong Hamdae""), which will ""protect national interests in the five oceans and contribute to world peace"" . As part of the plan, the ROK Navy established one task group, Commander Maritime Task Flotilla Seven on February 1, 2010, which evolved from Commander ASW Squadron 51 of the Component Flotilla Five. The Maritime Task Flotilla is composed of two ""Sejong the Great"" class AEGIS guided missile destroyers, and six ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" class destroyers. The force is hoped to be able to defend South Korea against any North Korean aggression as well as being able to protect trade routes vital to the ROK. It is also designed to be able to suppress disputes or territorial spats using deterrence and if necessary force. Currently the flotilla is divided into two squardons stationed at bases in Busan and Jinhae. When the new naval base at Jeju Island is completed in 2014 the ROKN will move newly commissioned vessels to the base to strengthen the fleet. In addition to combat operations the ships of the flotilla performs humanitarian operations: A ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" class destroyer of the Task Flotilla is being deployed in response to piracy attacks in shipping lanes off the coast of Somalia. Naval Education and Training Command. The Naval Education and Training Command is one of the two major shore commands of the ROK Navy responsible for training. It is located in Jinhae. Its primary role is to conduct the initial orientation and basic training for new recruits of the Navy and the Korea Coast Guard. One of the major subordinate units is the Naval War College located in Daejeon. Naval Logistics Command. The Naval Logistics Command is the other major shore command of the ROK Navy. It also operates the Naval Ship Yard located in Jinhae. Republic of Korea Naval Academy. The Republic of Korea Naval Academy is a four-year coeducational service academy located in Jinhae. It was established in 1946. Graduates are commissioned as Ensigns in the Navy or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps. The Naval Academy also hosts the Officer Candidate School, which provides training to become commissioned officers for civilian college graduates and candidates with military experience. Location. The ROK Navy operates several naval bases in South Korea: Jinhae, Busan, Donghae, Pyeongtaek, Mokpo, Incheon, Pohang. Naval air stations are in Pohang, Jinhae, and Mokpo. Jinhae has been the major port for the ROK Navy since the establishment of the Korean Coast Guard by hosting vital naval facilities including the Naval Shipyard. Busan has become another major naval base for the CINCROKFLT since its Command Headquarters moved from Jinhae in 2007. Donghae, Pyeongtaek, and Mokpo hosts the command headquarters of the First, Second and the Third Fleet respectively. Incheon hosts a Defense Command under an one-star admiral responsible for littoral waters close to Seoul, the nation's capital. Pohang has a naval base for amphibious forces such as the 1st Marine Division located nearby. The ROK Navy also plans to build a new naval base on the southern coast of Jeju-do for basing a squadron of the Maritime Task Flotilla and two submarine squadrons by 2014. The ROK Navy plans to strengthen its control over the seas around the Korean Peninsula by deploying these forces. Relationship with the U.S. Navy. South Korea has a joint military partnership with the United States as outlined by the Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. Commander U.S. Seventh Fleet (C7F) is designated as Commander Combined Naval Component Command (CCNCC) ""for the defense of the Korean peninsula; in the event of hostilities, all friendly naval forces in the theater would fall under C7F control."" The ROK and US Governments have agreed on the transfer of wartime operational control to the South Korean government in 2015. Commander Naval Forces Korea (CNFK) is a shore command of the United States Navy that serves as the shore support agency for all U.S. Naval activity in South Korea. Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae (CFAC) is a U.S. Naval installation in Jinhae. Personnel. The ROK Navy has about 68,000 personnel, including the 27,000 members of the ROK Marine Corps (as of 2010). Among these members, about 11 percent of them are commissioned officers and about 32 percent of them are non-commissioned officers (including warrant officers). As a part of ""Defense Reform 2020,"" which was proposed by the Roh Moo-hyun Administration, the ROK Navy has been directed to reduce its manpower to 64,000 sailors, airmen, and Marines. Military service is mandatory for all South Korean men. In the ROK Navy, all members are volunteers, with enlisted sailors and airmen serving for 26-month periods, and enlisted Marines serving for 24-month periods; commissioned officer, warrant officer, and non-commissioned officer serving longer terms than those of enlisted men, or as career sailor, airmen, and Marines. In the year 2001, six female ensigns, who had become commissioned officers through the officer candidate school, were assigned to serve on surface ships of the ROK Navy, for the first time ever. Commissioned officers. There are several paths to becoming a commissioned officer in the ROK Navy, including the Naval Academy, Officer Candidate School (OCS), and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC). Officer Candidate School, located at the Naval Academy, Jinhae, provides training for candidates with current or prior enlisted experience in the military and civilian college graduates, which take majority in OCS. Warrant officers. Following the traditions of the British Royal Navy the warrant officer rank in the South Korean armed forces falls in between that of non-commissioned and commissioned officers. In the ROK Navy, warrant officers are mostly former non-commissioned officers who had earned the rating of ""Wonsa"" (Master Chief Petty Officer) and who had been selected for and completed a warrant officer candidate program. Another route to becoming a naval warrant officer is to complete a naval aviation warrant officer candidate program. Warrant officers generally mess in the wardroom with commissioned officers. Petty officers. Petty officers originate from a petty officer candidate program. In the ROK Navy, personnel with ranks of ""Hasa"" through ""Wonsa"" are considered petty officers (i.e. non-commissioned officers) while those at ""Sangsa"" and ""Wonsa"" are further referred to as “CPO” (chief petty officer) collectively. There are the appointments of ""Juim Wonsa"" and ""Juim Sangsa"" equivalent to that of the U.S. Navy's Command Master Chief Petty Officer (CMCPO). The positions are filled by senior ""Wonsa"" and "" Sangsa"" respectively and unlike their U.S. Navy counterparts, the ROK Navy ""Juim Wonsa"" and ""Juim Sangsa"" wear the same standard rate insignia of ""Wonsa"" or "" Sangsa"" and only wear a special identification badge. Every ROK Navy establishment and ship has either ""Juim Wonsa"" or ""Juim Sangsa"". Petty officers wear a combination cap with a white cover and a gold chinstrap. Enlisted. In the ROK Navy, enlisted sailors are referred to as """"Subyeong"""" (수병; 水兵). Normally the enlisted sailors serve in the Navy for 23 months; after this, most of them are transferred from active duty to the naval reserve. Ranks and rates. In the ROK Navy, as in the rest of the ROK Armed Forces, ranks fall into one of four categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer (petty officer), and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority. Commissioned officer ranks are subdivided into """"Janggwan""""-level officers (flag officers), """"Yeonggawan""""-level officers (Lieutenant Commander through Captain), and """"Wigwan""""-level officers (Ensign through Lieutenant). All three branches – the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force) of the ROK Armed Forces share the same names of ranks as written in Hangul. ¹: No one held the rank of ""Wonsu"" in the history of the ROK Armed Forces yet. ²: Senior Captains in command of Squadrons can be referred to as “Commodore” verbally and in correspondence as in the U.S. Navy. Major international activities. The ROK Navy frequently participates in multinational exercises and international activities. Also it has engaged in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century. Anti-piracy operations. In March 2009, the ROK Navy deployed the ""Cheonghae"" task group in response to piracy attacks in shipping lanes off the coast of Somalia. This task group is composed of a ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" class destroyer and about 30 naval special warfare personnel. The group operates as part of the multinational task force, Combined Task Force 151 of Combined Maritime Forces (CMF). The ROK Navy has dispatched five warships to the mission area under the name of ""Cheonghae"" task group. As of September 2010, ROKS ""Wang Geon"" (DDH 978) is carrying out the mission in the area. On January 21, 2011 South Korean naval commandos carried out Operation Dawn of Gulf of Aden, an operation to rescue the crew of the hijacked MV ""Samho Jewelry"" and succeed in rescuing the crew and killing or capturing all of the pirates on board. International fleet review. In October 1998, the ROK Navy hosted its first international fleet review in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Republic of Korea and its armed forces off coast of Busan and Jinhae. 21 ships from 11 countries (Australia, Bangladesh, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States) participated in the fleet review as well as 34 ships and 15 aircraft from South Korea. The ROK Navy hosted its second international fleet review off coast of Busan in October 2008 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the South Korean government. 22 ships from 11 countries (Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States) participated in the fleet review as well as 33 ships and 27 aircraft from South Korea. The Cruise Training Unit – ROKS ""Kwaggaeto the Great"" (DDH 971), ROKS ""Jeju"" (FF 958) and ROKS ""Cheonji"" (AOE 57) participated in International Fleet Review 2002 commemorating the 50th anniversary of JMSDF in Tokyo Bay. The Cruise Training Fleet – ROKS ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin"" (DDH 975) and ROKS ""Cheonji"" (AOE 57) - visited the United Kingdom in order to take part in the International Fleet Review for Trafalgar 200 in 2005. In April 2009, ROKS ""Dokdo"" (LPH 6111) and ROKS ""Kang Gamchan"" (DDH 979) attended an international fleet review to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy in Qingdao. In August 2009, the Cruise Training Flotilla – ROKS ""Choi Young"" (DDH 981) and ROKS ""Daecheong"" (AOE 58) participated in the Indonesian International Fleet Review, which commemorates the 64th anniversary of Indonesian independence. Equipment. There are about 170 commissioned ships (with a total displacement of about 181,000 tons) in the ROK Navy, including some 20 destroyers and frigates, 12 submarines, 100 corvettes and fast attack craft as of 2011. The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Ships. The ROK Navy employs the U.S. Navy-style letter based hull classification symbols to designate the types of its ships and hull numbers to uniquely identify its vessels (e.g. DDH 975). The names are that of the historical figures, provinces, cities, counties, peaks, lakes, islands, and birds. The Chief of Naval Operations selects the names of ships. There are four ship ratings. A first-rate ship (DDG, DDH, Sohn Won-yil class SS, LPH, MLS, AOE, and ARS) is commanded by a captain; a second-rate ship (FF, SS, PCC, LST, and ATS) by a commander; a third-rate ship (SSM, PKG, MSH, and MHC) by a lieutenant commander; and a fourth-rate (PKM and LSF) is commanded by a lieutenant. Major commissioned ships. The ship prefix for all the commissioned ROK Navy ship is ROKS (Republic of Korea Ship) when the names of ships are written in English. Aircraft. Commander Air Wing Six is the name of the ROK Navy that is responsible for all of its aircraft. This Air Wing's operational headquarters is located in Pohang, and its naval air stations are Pohang (K-3), Jinhae (K-10), and Mokpo (K-15). Air Wing Six has about 20 fixed-wing and 50 rotary-wing aircraft as of 2011. Ongoing projects. Ships. The KSS program was a three-phased project to build up the ROK Navy's submarine forces. Before the KSS program, the submarine fleet of the ROK Navy consisted of midget submarines, such as the ""Dolgorae"" class submarine and ""SX 756 Dolphin"" class submarine, which had limited capabilities for inshore operations. Through the first phase, KSS-I, the ROK Navy acquired nine 1,200-ton ""Chang Bo-go"" class submarines. For the second phase, KSS-II, the ROK Navy plans to acquire nine 1,800-ton Type 214 submarines with Air-Independent propulsion (AIP) system; the lead ship of her class, the ""Sohn Won-yil"" (SS 072) was launched at a shipyard of Hyundai Heavy Industries on June 9, 2006. In June 2007, the ROK Navy launched its second 1,800-ton submarine named ""Jeong Ji"", after a military general of the Goryeo Kingdom who defeated Japanese invaders. The Type 214 submarine is expected to play a key role in safeguarding the country's maritime interests as a part of the Navy's Mobile Flotilla. The third phase of the program, KSS-III is scheduled to begin in 2007 and to build the lead ship of her class in 2017. A total of nine 3,000-ton KSS-III submarines are expected to be built in South Korea with indigenous technologies (i.e. not going under license as the previous KSS-I and KSS-II submarines). Korean experimental destroyer program is a three-phased program to modernize the surface fleet by developing and constructing new destroyers for the ROK Navy with advanced combat systems and weaponry. The outcomes of this program include the ""Kwanggaeto the Great""-class destroyers, which are the first ROK destroyers to be armed with surface-to-air missiles; the ""Chungmugong Yi Sunshin""-class ASW destroyers; and the powerful ""King Sejong the Great""-class destroyers, which are equipped with the sophisticated AEGIS combat system for air-defense and anti-missile operations. These new destroyers replaced antiquated destroyers that had been transferred from the U.S. Navy decades ago. In October 2009, the ROK Navy announced plans to build and commission six destroyers of 5,600-ton empty displacement with the AEGIS system (the KDX-II A destroyers) from 2019 to 2026 for beefing up the Maritime Task Flotilla. The FFX project aims to replace the ""Ulsan"" class frigates and ""Donghae""/""Pohang"" class corvettes with new 2,300-ton frigates. The total number of the ships to be built is 20 to 24 by 2020 and the first batch of six new frigates are planned to be commissioned by 2015, and another fourteen commissioned by 2018. Hyundai Heavy Industries will build the lead ship that is planned to enter service in 2011. These frigates will be armed with the American-made Phalanx CIWS system and the rolling airframe missile system, and they will each carry a Westland Lynx anti-submarine warfare helicopter. Through the PKX program, the ROK Navy plans to build a feet of a next generation patrol craft with ""Cooperative Engagement Capability"" and enhanced weaponry such as 76 mm guns and the KSSM anti-ship missiles. There are two variations of ""Geomdoksuri"" class patrol craft: ""Geomdoksuri""-A and ""Geomdoksuri""-B. The ""Geomdoksuri""-A will be a 570-ton patrol craft with anti-ship missiles; ""Geomdoksuri""-B will be a 300-ton patrol craft serving as the platform design for the ""Geomdoksuri""-A variation. It is speculated that 34 ""Geomdoksuri""-As and 18 ""Geomdoksuri""-Bs are planned. The first batch of nine ""Geomdoksuri""-As are expected to enter in service by 2015 and to replace the aging ""Chamsuri"" class patrol craft. On 28 June 2007, the ""Yoon Young-ha"" (PKG 711), the lead ship of her class, was launched at the shipyard of Hanjin Heavy Industries in Busan. She is scheduled to be delivered to the South Korean navy in 2008. The LPX project was the ROK Navy's new amphibious landing ship project for which Hanjin Heavy Industries & Constructions Co. has provided the general design package. The ROK Navy's requirements for the new amphibious landing ships were to enhance Korea's current amphibious operation capability, both in terms of assault and military operations other than war (MOOTW) type operations. On 12 July 2005, ROKS ""Dokdo"" (LPH 6111), the lead ship of her class, was launched at the shipyard of Hanjin Heavy Industries in Busan. She was delivered to the South Korean navy in July, 2007. The first air cushion landing craft (ROKS ""LSF 631"") of LSF-II project was delivered for ROKS ""Dokdo"" in April, 2007. In October 2009, the ROKN revealed that it plans to commission a new 14,500-ton (full displacement 18,800 tons) LPX around 2018. The ROK Navy plans to commission four new amphibious ships of 4,500-ton empty displacement between 2014 and 2017. The ROKN plans to commission an uncertain number of 12,000-ton fast combat support ships (AOE) around 2017 to relieve the 9,000-ton ""Cheonji"" class ships. Through ATS-II project, the ROKN will replace the two ex-USN ""Beaufort"" class ships with two locally built 3500-ton salvage and rescue ships. The ROK Navy plans to commission a new 4,500-ton training ship (ATX) for midshipmen and officer candidates around 2015. The ROKN plans to build and commission an uncertain number of minelayer ships similar to ROKS ""Wonsan"" (MLS 560). The ROKN plans to build and commission an uncertain number of mine countermeasure ships similar to the ""Yangyang"" class. Aircraft. The ROK Navy had acquired eight P-3C aircraft through the maritime patrol aircraft program phase I. Eight more ex-USN P-3CK maritime patrol aircraft had been delivered to the ROK Navy by 2010 after undergoing extensive refubishment and modernization. In May 2013 it was announced that DAPA was commencing a 1 trillion won ($900 million) procurement program to acquire up to 20 new anti-submarine warfare aircraft to replace the existing fleet of 16 P-3Cs. Possible candidates include the C-295 MPA, P-8 Poseidon and the SC-130J Sea Hercules. The ROK Navy had planned to acquire new mine countermeasure helicopters by 2012 with a budget of 480 billion won. AgustaWestland EH-101, NHIndustries NH-90, and Sikorsky MH-60S were being considered as possible candidates for the acquisition program before it decided to hold the project due to global financial crisis that hit the world in 2008.

wikipedia-2284364," Panjshir Valley  The Panjshir Valley (also spelled Panjsheer or Panjsher; - ""Dare-ye Panjšēr""; literally ""Valley of the Five Lions"") is a valley in north-central Afghanistan, 150 km north of Kabul, near the Hindu Kush mountain range. Located in the Panjshir Province it is divided by the Panjshir River. The valley is home to more than 140,000 people, including Afghanistan's largest concentration of ethnic Tajiks. As of April 2004, it became the heart of Panjshir Province. It was the site of the Panjshir offensives fought between the DRA and the Soviets against the mujahideen during the Soviet war in Afghanistan from 1980-1985.  Name. The name ""Panjshir"", literally meaning ""Five Lions"", refers to five Wali (literally, ""protectors""), highly spiritual brothers who were centered in the valley. Local legend has it that the five brothers built a dam for Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the early 11th century AD. The foundations serve today for a modern reservoir. Economy and natural resources. The Panjshir Valley has the potential to become a major center of emerald mining. As early as the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder commented on gemstones from the region. In the Middle Ages, Panjshir was famed for its silver mining and the Saffarids and Samanids minted their coins there. As of 1985, crystals upwards of had been found there, reported to rival in quality the finest crystals of the Muzo mine in Colombia. American reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan has sparked a development boom in the valley with the construction of new modern roads and a new radio tower that allows valley residents to pick up radio signals from the Afghan capital, Kabul. The valley has the potential of being an energy hub for Afghanistan, through construction of several electric dams.Rewat locality can be the site of the first electric dam. The valley can make the region around the Afghan capital electricity self reliant. The construction of an asphalted road to the Badakhshan Province can contribute to the prosperity of the valley. Tourism can constitute another major source of income. Wind farm. Tony Woods, a New Zealand renewable energy specialist, built a 10 turbine wind farm in Panjshir Valley in April 2008. "
wikipedia-2284385," Aleem Dar  Aleem Sarwar Dar (Urdu:علیم سرور ڈار) (born 6 June 1968 in Jhang, Punjab) is a retired Pakistani first-class cricketer and a member of the ICC Elite umpire panel. He won three consecutive ICC Umpire of the Year awards 2009, 2010 and 2011, after being nominated twice in 2005 and 2006. Aleem Dar and Simon Taufel were the only umpires to have received the award from its inception until 2012. He has played for Allied Bank, Gujranwala Cricket Association, Lahore, and Pakistan Railways as a right-handed batsman and a leg-break bowler. Since his retirement as a player, he has gained prominence as one of the leading umpires in international cricket. He was educated at Islamia College, Civil Lines, Lahore. Umpiring career. Dar is best known as an international cricket umpire. He made his international umpiring debut in an ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at Gujranwala on 16 February 2000. In 2002 he became a member of ICC's International Panel of umpires. He impressed the ICC with his accurate decision making, and was chosen to umpire at the ICC Cricket World Cup in early 2003, where he was one of the better-performing umpires. His high standard was again rewarded when he was appointed to stand in his first Test match in October 2003; the match between Bangladesh and England at Dhaka. Over the next six months he was appointed to stand in several more Test matches, and as a neutral umpire in ODI matches away from Pakistan. In April 2004, he became the first Pakistani to be part of the ICC Elite Umpire Panel. Since then he has been regarded as one of the top umpires, being nominated for the ICC Umpire of the year Award in 2005 and 2006, although he was beaten on both occasions by the Australian Simon Taufel, who is also very highly regarded. On 17 October 2007 Dar umpired in his 100th ODI (between India and Australia at Mumbai), making him the tenth umpire in the history of cricket to reach that landmark. He reached the landmark in a record time, taking just seven years, and became the first Pakistani to officiate in a century of One Day Internationals. Dar has stood in numerous high profile matches, including a solitary India-Pakistan ODI match at Karachi 2006 and five Ashes Test matches. He was also one of the on-field umpires for the final of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, standing alongside Rudi Koertzen. However, the highlight of his career so far, has been his appointment to stand in the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup between Australia and Sri Lanka, where he officiated with Steve Bucknor. Dar was also selected to stand in the final of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 between Australia and England. He has, however, never stood in a Test match in Pakistan, because his appointment in the international panel came after the introduction of neutral umpires for Test matches. In January 2005, Dar and his colleague Steve Bucknor, received death threats during a Test match between England and South Africa at Centurion. He was also involved in a controversy during the 2007 Cricket World Cup final where he, along with fellow officials Bucknor, Koertzen, Bowden and Crowe were unaware of the playing conditions regarding the result of a match under the Duckworth-Lewis system, and made Australia bowl three unnecessary overs in near darkness. Consequently the ICC decided to suspend him, along with the other four officials, from duty for the next ICC event, which was the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship.

wikipedia-2284446," Sebastes  Sebastes is a genus of fish in the family Sebastidae (though some include this in Scorpaenidae), most of which have the common name of rockfish. A few are called ocean perch, sea perch or redfish instead. Most of the ""Sebastes"" species live in the north Pacific, although two (""S. capensis"" and ""S. oculatus"") live in the south Pacific/Atlantic and four (""S. fasciatus"", ""S. mentella"", ""S. norvegicus"" and ""S. viviparus"") live in the north Atlantic. The coast off South California is the area of highest rockfish diversity, with 56 species living in the Southern California Bight. The fossil record of rockfish goes back to the Miocene, from California and Japan (although fossil otoliths from Belgium, """"Sebastes"""" ""weileri"", may push the record back as far as the Oligocene). Rockfish are an important sport and commercial fish, and many species have been overfished. As a result seasons are tightly controlled in many areas. ""Sebastes"" are sometimes fraudulently substituted for the more expensive red snapper (""L. campechanus""). Ecology. Rockfish range from the intertidal zone to almost deep, usually living benthically on various substrates, often (as the name suggests) around rock outcrops. Some rockfish species are very long-lived, amongst the longest-living fish on earth, with several species known to surpass 100 years of age, and a maximum reported age of 205 years for ""S. aleutianus"".

wikipedia-2284489," Jay Johnston  Jay Johnston (born October 22, 1968) is an American actor and comedian best known for his work as a writer and cast member on the HBO sketch comedy series ""Mr. Show"" and for playing the role of Officer Jay McPherson on ""The Sarah Silverman Program"". Biography. Johnston was born and raised in Chicago and attended Columbia College Chicago, where he studied acting and comedy alongside other future ""Mr. Show"" alumni such as Dino Stamatopoulos, Scott Adsit and Eric Hoffman. After graduating college, Johnston later joined the Chicago Second City's touring comedy for a number of years and also performed in stage shows at the Annoyance Theater in Chicago. Jay Johnston's contribution to ""Mr. Show"" were generally of the ""evergreen"" variety, dealing with more or less universal themes as opposed to the more political/socially satirical material that his fellow writers/performers contributed to the series. As such, Jay was responsible for many of the show's memorable sketches and characters. Johnston often incorporated physical comedy into the show, most notably in the ""The Story of Everest"" sketch, which features Johnston performing an astounding number of comical pratfalls. Since the conclusion of ""Mr. Show"", Johnston has made guest appearances in a number of television programs such as ""Arrested Development"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", and ""Parks and Recreation"", as well as appearing in films such as """" and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.  In 2006, Johnston regularly appeared as ""The Boss"" on FUEL TV's ""American Misfits"", in the show's intro and outro sketch segments. The show is a half-hour mix of skateboarding and sketches, very much in the mold of the early 1990s skateboarding videos. Johnston starred on all three seasons of Comedy Central's ""The Sarah Silverman Program"" as ""Officer Jay McPherson"", the love interest of Sarah's sister Laura in the series. The series reunited Johnston with several ""Mr. Show"" cast members such as Brian Posehn, Scott Aukerman, B.J. Porter and Paul F. Tompkins. In 2011, Johnston appeared as a sketch regular in season two of the Comedy Central sketch comedy series ""Nick Swardson's Pretend Time"". Johnston, along with fellow ""Mr. Show"" regulars Dino Stamatopoulos and Scott Adsit, were part of the creative team (voicing, writing, directing and producing) behind Adult Swim's stop-motion animation series ""Moral Orel"", which ran from 2005 to 2008. Johnston also provides voices for Stamatopoulos' current Adult Swim series, ""Mary Shelley's Frankenhole"", which began airing in 2010. Johnston currently has a recurring voice role as Jimmy Pesto in the FOX animated series ""Bob's Burgers"". "

wikipedia-2284519," Stepper  A stepper is a device used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) that is similar in operation to a slide projector or a photographic enlarger. Steppers are an essential part of the complex process, called photolithography, that creates millions of microscopic circuit elements on the surface of tiny chips of silicon. These chips form the heart of ICs such as computer processors, memory chips, and many other devices. The stepper's role in photolithography. Elements of the circuit to be created on the IC are reproduced in a pattern of transparent and opaque areas on the surface of a quartz plate called a photomask or reticle. The stepper passes light through the reticle, forming an image of the reticle pattern. The image is focused and reduced by a lens, and projected onto the surface of a silicon wafer that is coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist.  After exposure in the stepper, the coated wafer is developed like photographic film, causing the photoresist to dissolve in certain areas according to the amount of light the areas received during exposure. These areas of photoresist and no photoresist reproduce the pattern on the reticle. The developed wafer is then exposed to acids or other chemicals. The acid etches away the silicon in the parts of the wafer that are no longer protected by the photoresist coating. The other chemicals are used to change the electrical characteristics of the silicon in the bare areas. The wafer is then cleaned, recoated with photoresist, then passed through the stepper again in a process that creates the circuit on the silicon, layer by layer. The entire process is called photolithography or photo engineering. When the wafer is processed in the stepper, the pattern on the reticle (which may contain a number of individual chip patterns) is exposed repeatedly across the surface of the wafer in a grid. The stepper gets its name from the fact that it moves or ""steps"" the wafer from one shot location to another. This is accomplished by moving the wafer back and forth and left and right under the lens of the stepper. Previous generations of photolithographic equipment would expose the entire wafer, all at once; a stepper, working on a limited area, is capable of higher resolution. As of 2008, the most detailed patterns in semiconductor device fabrication are transferred using a type of stepper called a scanner, which moves the wafer and reticle with respect to each other during the exposure, as a way of increasing the size of the exposed area and increasing the imaging performance of the lens. Basic operation. The silicon wafers are coated with photoresist, and placed in a cassette or ""boat"" that holds a number of wafers. This is then placed in a part of the stepper called the wafer loader, usually located at the lower front of the stepper.  A robot in the wafer loader picks up one of the wafers from the cassette and loads it onto the wafer stage where it is aligned to enable another, finer alignment process that will occur later on.  The pattern of the circuitry for each chip is contained in a pattern etched in chrome on the reticle, which is a plate of transparent quartz. A typical reticle used in steppers is 6 inches square and has a usable area of 104mm by 132mm.  A variety of reticles, each appropriate for one stage in the process, are contained in a rack in the reticle loader, usually located at the upper front of the stepper. Before the wafer is exposed a reticle is loaded onto the reticle stage by a robot, where it is also very precisely aligned. Since the same reticle can be used to expose many wafers, it is loaded once before a series of wafers is exposed, and is realigned periodically. Once the wafer and reticle are in place and aligned, the wafer stage, which is moved very precisely in the X and Y directions (front to back and left to right) by worm screws or linear motors, carries the wafer so that the first of the many patterns (or ""shots"") to be exposed on it is located below the lens, directly under the reticle.  Although the wafer is aligned after it is placed on the wafer stage, this alignment is not sufficient to ensure that the layer of circuitry to be printed onto the wafer exactly overlays previous layers already there. Therefore each shot is aligned using special alignment marks that are located in the pattern for each final IC chip. Once this fine alignment is completed, the shot is exposed by light from the stepper's illumination system that passes through the reticle, through a reduction lens, and on to the surface of the wafer. A process program or ""recipe"" determines the length of the exposure, the reticle used, as well as other factors that affect the exposure.  Each shot located in a grid pattern on the wafer and is exposed in turn as the wafer is stepped back and forth under the lens. When all shots on the wafer are exposed, the wafer is unloaded by the wafer loader robot, and another wafer takes its place on the stage. The exposed wafer is eventually moved to a developer where the photoresist on its surface is exposed to developing chemicals that wash away areas of the photoresist, based on whether or not they were exposed to the light passing through the reticle. The developed surface is then subjected to other processes of photolithography. Major subassemblies. A typical stepper has the following subassemblies: wafer loader, wafer stage, wafer alignment system, reticle loader, reticle stage, reticle alignment system, reduction lens, and illumination system. Process programs for each layer printed on the wafer are executed by a control system centering on a computer that stores the process program, reads it, and communicates with the various subassemblies of the stepper in carrying out the program's instructions. The components of the stepper are contained in a sealed chamber that is maintained at a precise temperature to prevent distortions in the printed patterns that might be caused by expansion or contraction of the wafer due to temperature variations. The chamber also contains other systems that support the process, such as air conditioning, power supplies, control boards for the various electrical components, and others. Illumination and the challenges of improving resolution. The greatest limitation on the ability to produce increasingly finer lines on the surface of the wafer has been the wavelength of the light used in the exposure system. As the required lines have become narrower and narrower, illumination sources producing light with progressively shorter wavelengths have been put into service in steppers and scanners.  The ability of an exposure system, such as a stepper, to resolve narrow lines is limited by the wavelength of the light used for illumination, the ability of the lens to capture light (or actually orders of diffraction) coming at increasingly wider angles (called numerical aperture or N.A.), and various improvements in the process itself. This is expressed by the following equation: formula_1 formula_2 is the critical dimension, or finest line resolvable, formula_3 is a coefficient expressing process-related factors, formula_4 is the wavelength of the light, and formula_5 is the numerical aperture. Decreasing the wavelength of the light in the illumination system increases the resolving power of the stepper.  Twenty years ago, the ultraviolet ""g-line"" (436 nm) of the mercury spectrum was used to create lines in the 750 nm range in steppers that employed mercury lamps as their illumination source. Several years later systems employing the ""i-line"" (365 nm) from mercury lamps were introduced to create lines as low as 350 nm. As the desired line widths approached and eventually became narrower than the wavelength of the light used to create them, a variety of resolution enhancement techniques were developed to make this possible, such as phase shifting reticles and various techniques for manipulating the angles of the exposure light in order to maximize the resolving power of the lens. Eventually however, the desired line widths became narrower than what was possible using mercury lamps, and near the middle of the last decade, the semiconductor industry moved towards steppers that employed krypton-fluoride (KrF) excimer lasers producing 248 nm light. Such systems are currently being used to produce lines in the 110 nm range. Lines as low as 32 nm are being resolved by production-capable steppers using argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers that emit light with a wavelength of 193 nm. Although fluoride (F2) lasers are available that produce 157 nm light, they are not practical because of their low power and because they quickly degrade the materials used to make the lenses in the stepper.  Since practical light sources with wavelengths narrower than these lasers have not been available, manufacturers have sought to improve resolution by reducing the process coefficient formula_3. This is done by further improving techniques for manipulating the light as it passes through the illumination system and the reticle, as well as improving techniques for processing the wafer before and after exposure. Manufacturers have also introduced ever larger and more expensive lenses as a means of increasing the numerical aperture. However, these techniques are approaching their practical limit, and line widths in the 45 nm range appear to be near the best that can be achieved with conventional design.  Ultimately, other sources of illumination will have to be put to use, such as electron beams, x-rays or similar sources of electromagnetic energy with wavelengths much shorter than visible light. However, in order to delay as long as possible the vast expense and difficulty of adopting a whole new type of illumination technology, manufacturers have turned to a technique, previously used in microscopes, for increasing the numerical aperture of the lens by allowing the light to pass through water instead of air. This method, called immersion lithography, is the current cutting edge of practical production technology. It works because numerical aperture is a function of the maximum angle of light that can enter the lens and the refractive index of the medium through which the light passes. When water is employed as the medium, it greatly increases numerical aperture, since it has a refractive index of 1.44 at 193 nm, while air has an index of 1. Current production machines employing this technology are capable of resolving lines in the 32 nm range, and may eventually be able to achieve lines of 30 nm. Scanners. Modern scanners are steppers that increase the length of the area exposed in each shot (the exposure field) by moving the reticle stage and wafer stage in opposite directions to each other during the exposure. Instead of exposing the entire field at once, the exposure is made through an ""exposure slit"" that is as wide as the exposure field, but only a fraction of its length (such as a 9x25 mm slit for a 35x25 mm field). The image from the exposure slit is scanned across the exposure area.  There are several benefits to this technique. The field can be exposed with a lesser reduction of size from the reticle to the wafer (such as 4x reduction on a scanner, compared with 5x reduction on a stepper), while allowing a field size much larger than that which can be exposed with a typical stepper. Also the optical properties of the projection lens can be optimized in the area through which the image of the projection slit passes, while optical aberrations can be ignored outside of this area, because they will not affect the exposed area on the wafer.  Successful scanning requires extremely precise synchronization between the moving reticle and wafer stages during the exposure. Accomplishing this presents many technological challenges. See also.

wikipedia-2284563," Taste aversion  Conditioned taste aversion, also known as Garcia effect (after Dr. John Garcia), and as ""Sauce-Bearnaise Syndrome"", a term coined by Seligman and Hager, is an example of classical conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning. Conditioned taste aversion occurs when a subject associates the taste of a certain food with symptoms caused by a toxic, spoiled, or poisonous substance. Generally, taste aversion is caused after ingestion of the food causes nausea, sickness, or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an adaptive trait or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. This association is meant to prevent the consumption of the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. However, conditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs in subjects when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the food (for example, a subject who gets a cold or the flu shortly after eating bananas might develop an aversion to the taste of bananas). Garcia's study. While studying the effects of radiation on various behaviours during the 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively. This finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion. Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa. Notes concerning taste aversion. Taste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop—that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may ""hope"" to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited. Also, taste aversion generally only requires one trial. The experiments of Ivan Pavlov required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening. If the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called latent inhibition. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats. Aversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes. Taste aversion in humans. Taste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until extinction occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to ""cause"" the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats sushi for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus or influenza may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcohol because of vomiting during intoxication. Taste aversion is a common problem with chemotherapy patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food. Applications of taste aversion. Taste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators. In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits. When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey. Stimulus generalization. Stimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating tangerines and clementines because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous.

wikipedia-2284615," Lanfang Republic  The Lanfang Republic () was a Chinese state in West Kalimantan in Indonesia that was established by a Hakka Chinese named Luo Fangbo (羅芳伯) in 1777, until it was ended by Dutch occupation in 1884. Arrival of the Chinese. The sultans of Western Borneo imported Chinese laborers in 18th century to work in gold or tin mines. A number of mining communities (""kongsi"") enjoyed some political autonomy, but Lanfang is the best known thanks to a history written by Yap Siong-yoen, the son-in-law of the last kapitan of the Lanfang ""kongsi"", which was translated into Dutch in 1885. None of the other Chinese mining settlements in western Kalimantan left written accounts (Heidhues 2001:169). Rule of Luo Fangbo. The founding father of the Lanfang Republic was Luo Fangbo who hailed from Meizhou in Guangdong Province. Chinese settlers have long lived in Borneo island, with most engaging in trading and mining. They formed their own companies (""kongsi""), among which was the Southern Company headed by Luo.  As Dutch imperialism encroached upon modern-day Indonesia, Luo established the Lanfang Republic (with its capital in East Wanjin) to protect the Chinese settlers and other indigenous peoples from Dutch oppression. The settlers subsequently elected Luo as their inaugural president. Luo implemented many democratic principles, including the idea that all matters of state must involve the consultation of the republic's citizenry. He also created a comprehensive set of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies. The Republic did not have a standing military, but had a defense ministry that administered a national militia based on conscription. During peacetime, the populace mostly engaged in farming, production, trading, and mining. Lanfang's administrative divisions included three tiers (province, prefecture, and county) with the people electing leaders for all levels.  Although Luo discarded the ancient institutions of monarchism and dynastic succession, he continued to adhere to many Chinese traditions. For example, he established the founding year of the republic as the first year of the calendar. Moreover, he submitted a report to the Chinese emperor notifying him about the Republic's founding and paid tribute to the Chinese Qing Empire.  Luo served as head of state until his death in 1795. Afterwards, Lanfang citizens elected Jiang Wubo (江戊伯) as their next president. Lanfang citizens elected a total of twelve leaders, who helped improve agricultural techniques, expand mine production, develop cultural education, and organize military training. These measures allowed Lanfang to increase its wealth and power, which encouraged the non-Chinese indigenous population to pledge their allegiances to Lanfang. Quickly, the borders of Lanfang expanded to cover the whole of Borneo. The Lanfang Republic also helped the Sultan of Brunei suppress a rebellion. In appreciation of Lanfang's actions, the Bruneian Sultan deferred to Lanfang power.  Although the Republic had both ethnic Chinese citizens (numbering in the tens of thousands) and indigenous subjects (numbering in the hundreds of thousands), the ethnic Chinese were the only ones who voted in presidential elections. Thus, Luo would not dare call himself a king in front of the ethnic Chinese citizens, but was not afraid to do so in front of his indigenous subjects.  Dutch conquest. In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese Qing Empire weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. Thus, Lanfang Republic's vigorous development suffered from the eventual expansion of the Dutch. The Republic's citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Many of Lanfang's citizens and their descendants made their way to Singapore, which subsequently became another ethnic Chinese republic in Southeast Asia. The three campaigns waged by the Dutch East Indies Army against the Chinese ""kongsi"", called the Kongsi Wars, were: This last one resulted in the subjugation of the Chinese and the loss of autonomy.

The Phantom Woman is an introductory episode in the beginning arc of AD Police showing us a rogue boomer that cannot be taken down by normal police and the assistance of the AD Police are called in to help. After killing a few of the advanced police the squad commander orders the boomer to be killed by firing squad, destroying the storefront the boomer worked at in the process. Later it is theorized that one of the AD Police members killed was part of a larger scam but to correct that two AD Police offers agree to help prove it incorrect. After getting new leads that set them on the right path to follow, their visited a hacker who is able to provide them with a list of possible users that have illegally been recycling old boomer parts. The two follow the next lead that helps them to learn the original boomer was part of an underground sex boomer business that unfortunately one of the police officers has stumbled into the heart of and was attacked by one of these such boomers. A fight insures with the lead female detective who delivers the finishing blow via pistol to the rogue boomers head thus concluding the episode.

Two officers of the normal police are cast in this episode to help find the killer and bring it to justice. While the victims all share the same stabbing to the abdomen, they died however from massive cardiac arrest or shock. While one of the normal officers is at the organ bank to replace her eye with a cybernetic replacement because of discomfort she notices an argument from another of the clients, Caroline Evers, a billionaire and business tycoon. After bumping into her, she has a hunch Caroline is somehow connected to the murders. It also comes to light that Ms. Evers had almost her entire lower body converted into cybernetic parts. Later the younger of the officers investigates an abandoned part of Paradise Loop herself and runs into Ms. Evers of all people. When it is unveiled Caroline is “The Ripper” she explains that long ago she had been competing for CEO of her current company, however a man got the job because he concocted a bogus chart that compared her menstrual cycles to her productivity.

After finishing her confession, Ms. Evers moves to kill the officer but the AD Police break through the walls and open fire thus saving her. It is revealed that should more than 70% of the human body become cybernetic your treated as a “boomeroid” and thus can be killed with the same prejudice as a boomer, as such the order comes in to kill Caroline Evers, not to arrest her. The episode concludes with the officer agreeing to throw away some of her humanity for the surgery. This episode stars Billy Fanword, Captain of the AD Police Spacial Mobile Squad.

It is also theorized that he acts like a tank with a human brain; smart & intelligent but with no fear of pain or death he loses touch to his human side and that impacts his performance in the field, an emotional/stimulation issue not mechanical. His ex-lover Jeena progressively tries to get him to remember his human side with no avail. After finding out the prideful doctors plan to let him die in the line of duty to rid herself of his poor performance he helps himself to massive doses of DA-27 that finally do him in. Going on a massive rampage, he kills the doctor and many of his AD Police comrades, viewing it as more like a dream than reality.

wikipedia-2284768," Patroon  In the United States, a patroon (from Dutch ""patroon"", owner or head of a company) was a landholder with manorial rights to large tracts of land in the 17th century Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America. Through the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions of 1629, the Dutch West India Company first started to grant this title and land to some of its invested members. These inducements to foster colonization and settlement (also known as the ""Rights and Exemptions""), are the basis for the patroon system. The deeded tracts were called patroonships and could span 16 miles in length on one side of a major river, or 8 miles if spanning both sides. In 1640 the charter was revised to cut new plot sizes in half, and to allow any Dutch American in good standing to purchase an estate. The title of patroon came with powerful rights and privileges, similar to those of a lord in the feudal period. A patroon could create civil and criminal courts, appoint local officials and hold land in perpetuity. In return, he was commissioned by the Dutch West India Company to establish a settlement of at least 50 families within four years on the land. As tenants working for the patroon, these first settlers were relieved of the duty of public taxes for ten years, but were required to pay the patroon in money, goods, or services in kind. A patroonship had its own village and other infrastructure, including churches (which recorded births, baptisms, and marriages). After the British takeover of New Netherland in 1664, the system continued with the granting of large tracts known as manors, and sometimes referred to as patroonships. Rensselaerswyck. The largest and most successful patroonship in New Netherland was the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, established by Kiliaen van Rensselaer. Rensselaerswyck covered almost all of present-day Albany and Rensselaer counties and parts of present-day Columbia and Greene counties in New York State. Abolition. The word patroonship was used until the year 1775, when the English redefined the lands as estates and took away the jurisdictional privilege. However, this merely turned the still substantial Dutch population entirely toward the cause of the Independence movement. Nonetheless after the war, the newly recognized New York State government refused to overturn the law. Consequently, Rensselaerswyck was dismantled in the 18th century and became different counties and towns in New York's Capital District. "
wikipedia-2284781," Philippine Sailfin Lizard  The Philippine Sailfin Lizard, Crested Lizard, Sail-fin Lizard, Sailfin Water Lizard, or Soa-soa Water Lizard (Hydrosaurus pustulatus) is an oviparous lizard living only in the Philippines. The Philippine sailfin Lizard is an excellent swimmer and has flattened toes that enable it to run across water. It is omnivorous, feeding on fruit, leaves, flowers, insects, and small animals . It lives near rivers in the tropical forests of the Philippines. Males have a larger crest on their back than the females. The males also show a violet color as they grow older. Females are less colorful. The Philippine sailfin lizard lives mainly beside water, e.g., rivers, riverbanks, rice-fields, etc., as these lizards love to swim. The adults may reach up to a metre in length. Due to confusion with ""H. amboinensis"", the exact distribution in the Philippines is uncertain, but northern populations are generally considered ""H. pustulatus"" and southern considered ""H. amboinensis"". Conservation. Sailfin dragons have now been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Their main threats are habitat loss, being hunted for food and collection for the pet trade. Sailfin lizards in captivity. Philippine sailfin lizards were commonly available in the United States during the 1990s, but today they are now rare and expensive in the United States (costing about $900 for a captive bred juvenile). Breeding in captivity has only been done in a few cases. "
wikipedia-2284788," Curse of Tippecanoe  The name Curse of Tippecanoe (also known as Tecumseh's Curse, the Presidential Curse, Zero-Year Curse, the Twenty-Year Curse, or the Twenty-Year Presidential Jinx) is used to describe the regular death in office of Presidents of the United States elected or re-elected in years divisible by twenty, from William Henry Harrison (elected in 1840) through John F. Kennedy (1960). Ronald Reagan, elected in 1980, was shot and survived; George W. Bush (2000) survived an attempt on his life unharmed. The curse. The curse, first widely noted in a ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" book published in 1931, began with the death of William Henry Harrison, who died in 1841 after having been elected in 1840. For the next 120 years, presidents elected during years ending in a zero (occurring every 20 years) ultimately died while serving in office, from Harrison to John F. Kennedy (elected 1960, died 1963). The name ""Curse of Tippecanoe"" derives from the 1811 battle. As governor of the Indiana Territory, William Harrison used questionable tactics in the negotiation of the 1809 Treaty of Fort McHenry with Native Americans, in which they ceded large tracts of land to the U.S. government. The treaty further angered the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, and brought government soldiers and Native Americans to the brink of war in a period known as Tecumseh's War. Tecumseh and his brother organized a group of Indian tribes designed to resist the westward expansion of the United States. In 1811, Tecumseh's forces, led by his brother, attacked Harrison's army in the Battle of Tippecanoe, earning Harrison fame and the nickname ""Old Tippecanoe"". Harrison strengthened his reputation even more by defeating the British at the Battle of the Thames during the War of 1812. In an account of the aftermath of the battle, Tecumseh's brother Tenskwatawa, known as the Prophet, supposedly set a curse against Harrison and future White House occupants who became president during years with the same end number as Harrison. This is the basis of the curse legend. Media mentions. After the observation by Ripley, talk of the curse resurfaced as the next cursed election year approached. A similar oddities cartoon feature, ""Strange as it Seems"" by John Hix, appeared prior to Election Day 1940, with ""CURSE OVER THE WHITE HOUSE!"" A list, running from ""1840 - Harrison"" to ""1920 - Harding"" was followed by the ominous ""1940 - ??????"" and the note that ""In the last 100 years, Every U.S. President Elected at 20-Year Intervals Has Died In Office!"" Ed Koterba, author of a syndicated column called ""Assignment Washington"", referred to the subject again in 1960. As 1980 approached, the curse was sufficiently well-known, and Americans wondered whether the winner of that election would follow the pattern. The Library of Congress conducted a study in the summer of 1980 about the origin of the tale, and concluded that ""although the story has been well-known for years, there are no documented sources and no published mentions of it"". Running for re-election in 1980, President Jimmy Carter was asked about the curse at a campaign stop in Dayton on October 2 of that year. Taking questions from the crowd, Carter replied, ""I'm not afraid. If I knew it was going to happen, I would go ahead and be President and do the best I could, for the last day I could."" Exceptions. The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was not followed by his death in office, despite being seriously wounded in an assassination attempt within months of his inauguration. Days after Reagan survived the shooting, columnist Jack Anderson wrote ""Reagan and the Eerie Zero Factor"" and noted that the 40th president had either disproved the superstition, or had nine lives. Reagan, the oldest man to be elected President, also survived treatment for colon cancer while in office. First Lady Nancy Reagan was reported to have hired psychics and astrologers to try to protect her husband from the effects of the curse. Reagan left office on January 20, 1989, and ultimately died of Alzheimer's Disease on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93. His would-be assassin, John Hinckley, Jr., was found by a jury to be insane, but there was no evidence that he was motivated by a belief in the curse. The next president in the line of the curse, George W. Bush in 2000, was unharmed in an assassination attempt in 2005. He finished out his final term on January 20, 2009 and survives to the present day. The only president who died in office without being elected in a ""cursed"" year was Zachary Taylor, who was elected in 1848 and died in 1850. However, Taylor also fought against Tecumseh, during the War of 1812, and is considered by some as having also been ""killed"" by the curse. "
wikipedia-2284808," The Saga of Darren Shan  The Saga of Darren Shan (known as ""Cirque du Freak: The Saga of Darren Shan"" in the US) is a young adult 12 part book series written by Darren Shan (his real name, Darren O'Shaughnessy) about the struggle of a boy who has become involved in the world of vampires. As of October 2008, the book is published in 33 countries around the world, in 30 different languages. A movie based on the first three books in the series was released in theaters October 23, 2009. Harper Collins Audio have also released CD recordings of the first three books, read by Rupert Degas. Background. Darren Shan, whose real name is Darren O'Shaughnessy, wrote and published the first book of the series, ""Cirque du Freak"", as a side project between two adult books. ""Cirque du Freak"" received good reviews and Warner Bros. bought the movie rights in a seven figure deal prior to publication, though the film was never made and the film rights returned to Shan after three years. Now, Universal Pictures own the movie rights and a feature film was released in theaters October 23, 2009. Plot outline. ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" follows the story of Darren Shan, a normal human boy who is coerced by the vampire Larten Crepsley into becoming his assistant and a half-vampire. Darren Shan's vampires. The vampires in the Saga are different from the standard vampires found in popular culture. They are truly alive, can be killed by several means—including, but not limited to, decapitation or piercing of the heart—and are not inherently evil. Vampires do not drink from the neck, but cut a vein of a victim, drinking small amounts of blood from the vein, and then healing it with their saliva; a breakaway group called the ""vampaneze"" insist on killing their victims and draining all their blood. Doing this, the ""Vampaneze need to feed less often"". The problem with this is, the ""vampaneze"" can become stronger by doing so. Draining all of a human's blood would have a vampire or vampaneze absorb part of the spirit of the human, allowing the vampire or vampaneze to see into their memories (Darren does this in The Vampire's Assistant, to save the spirit of a dying friend). Neither vampires nor vampaneze have fangs, but instead use their hard, sharp nails to cut into their prey. These nails can also be used to scale walls in a spider-like manner. Vampires do not combust when exposed to sunlight, but it will burn them easily and exposure for four or five hours will kill them. They can, however, remain active during the day (provided they remain in the shade) and are not bothered by garlic, silver, or holy objects (such as crosses and holy water). Fresh human blood is the most nutritious for vampires, but they can feed on preserved human blood or the blood of certain animals when necessary. Some animals' blood, however, is toxic to vampires. Vampires cannot reproduce; further vampires are created by blood-to-blood contact with humans, traditionally through the fingertips, but if any creature, human or animal, were to orally ingest vampire blood, it would be driven into a murderous frenzy and then die (similar to rabies). Vampires are not immortal either; they age at one-tenth the human rate (half-vampires one-fifth). This comes into play in the series when Darren meets an old girlfriend he had; now they are adults but Darren still looks about the same as he did when they first met. The oldest vampire in the series is Paris Skyle (claimed to have inspired the popular vampire folklore entity, ""Dracula""), who was ""blooded"" at age two and lived for over 800 years. Vampires cast reflections and shadows but cannot be photographed due to a particular vibration of ""vampire atoms."" And like in folklore, they sleep in coffins. Vampires are strong, fit, and can run at a very high speed, called ""flitting"". Flitting causes a static charge to build up in a vampire's body, which Mr. Crepsley learned to use to force open locks. A vampire's senses are all superhuman. They can endure incredible amounts of physical trauma, are resistant to most chemicals and diseases, and heal quickly. A vampire's healing factor is not as effective as in most fiction, and, unlike the beautiful vampires of Anne Rice, most of Shan's vampires are heavily scarred and unattractive. More abilities include breathing an invisible gas that renders a human unconscious, telepathically communicating with other vampires and humans (three vampires could also mentally command spiders), and locating vampires and humans whose thought patterns they have learned to recognize. Vampires cannot dematerialize into a mist, nor can they transform into bats, rats, or wolves. On the other hand, these animals are friendly to vampires, although cats and dogs hate them. The blood of snakes, rats, and cats are poisonous to them.  Vampire society is ruled by honor, personal pride, and tradition. They have a strict hierarchy with higher ranking vampires having absolute rule over lower ranking ones, though they exercise their powers in moderation and are respectful of those beneath them. There are far fewer female vampires than male ones. Vampire matings last only ten or fifteen years with the couple then choosing to re-mate or go their separate ways. Vampires are forbidden to use projectile weapons like guns, bows, and crossbows as they view these as dishonorable, preferring hand-to-hand fighting with swords, axes, etc., or throwing weapons such as a shuriken; the vampaneze are forbidden from using any form of throwing weapons. Vampires live old fashion lives: no vampire is shown making references to pop culture, driving a car, or using computers. Vampires see humans as a chaotic and slightly inferior race, but most value human lives. Some vampires form friendships with humans and many fall in love with humans. Vampire Gavner Purl boasts a pair of pink underpants embroidered with elephants, a present from a former human girlfriend. Darren Shan's vampires do not follow the religions they did as humans, but worship an unidentified pantheon. They believe that the souls of good vampires are reborn as wolves in the eternal nights of a distant world called Paradise, while evil vampire souls remain bound to the Earth for eternity. They do have gods, but there are a great number of them and they are referred to as The Vampire Gods. Vampires believe they are descended from wolves, just as humans are believed to have evolved from primates. Wolves are held as the cousins of vampires. Wolves like vampires, especially since they have a scent that means no harm to them. Vampaneze. In ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" the Vampaneze are sworn enemies to the vampires, believing that there is honour in killing their victims and claiming their souls. They were vampires who broke away from the clan (600 years before the third book) and claimed themselves a new race (Vampaneze) because of the different customs they held. The Vampaneze are considered the antagonists, though they only appear that way due to the misleading image of Murlough (a mad Vampaneze), The Vampaneze Lord and the War of the Scars; Mr Crepsley himself noted that vampaneze had some positive traditions such as their refusal to lie and their sense of honour. The Vampaneze have purple skin and red hair, eyes, lips, and fingernails though it takes a couple of decades for this colouring to set in. This is a side effect due to drinking a lot of blood: they must kill when they drink blood. Many Vampaneze do not want to fight the vampires. The Vampaneze are first mentioned in ""Tunnels of Blood"" and become a main part of the plot throughout the rest of the series. Examples of Vampeneze include Murlough and Gannen Harst. Death's Touch Sign. The Death's Touch Sign is a hand position used in the famous ""Saga of Darren Shan"" series. The hand position is to take you right hand and to put it over your face so that the middle finger is on your forehead, the ring and pinky fingers are on the left side of your face, and the pointer finger and thumb are on the right side. The sign translates to, ""Even in Death, may you be Triumphant."" The sign is first shown in book 5 of the series, Trials of Death, when Darren must take the Trails of Initiation nicknamed the Trials of Death. Vampires throughout Vampire Mountain direct the sign to him to show that they wish him good luck. It is used by vampires throughout Vampire Mountain to show their appreciate towards a dead or no doubt ""about to die"" vampire. Manga. A manga series called Cirque du Freak based on the Darren Shan novels was published in the Shogakukan anthology Shonen Sunday by Takahiro Arai in a weekly serialization. The volumes are being published in the UK and USA by HarperCollins and Yen Press respectively. Short stories. Darren Shan has released numerous short stories on his website, all of which tie into the saga. The Sam Grest stories have been included in the Midnight Feast collection. Sam Grest was only significant in ""The Vampire's Assistant"". "
wikipedia-2284812," The Vampire's Assistant  ""The Vampire's Assistant"" is the second novel in ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" by Darren Shan (Whose real name is Darren O'Shaughnessy). It is part of the ""Vampire Blood"" trilogy, which comprises the three books ""Cirque Du Freak"", ""The Vampire's Assistant"" and ""Tunnels of Blood"". ""The Vampire's Assistant"" was first published in Great Britain by Collins in 2000, and was later published in the ""Vampire Blood"" trilogy in 2003. Synopsis. The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout. Darren is beginning to cope with life as a vampire's assistant though he still refuses to drink human blood and hates his companion, Mr. Crepsley, for turning him into a half vampire which has led him to faking his own death. Although he is far stronger than any human and is still finding it hard to adjust to his new life. His unchallenged strength causes him to be alone, as he can not make any human friends without harming them. Larten teaches Darren all about vampirism and sometimes is shown to regret blooding Darren and decides to take him to the Cirque du Freak. He makes good friends with Evra Von, the snake boy. When they meet a young boy called Sam Grest who loves pickled onions, things begin to look up...and down. A local ecological preserver hippie known as Reggie Veggie (RV) befriends the trio of boys, but soon begins to learn about the animals that the Little People are feeding on animals stolen from farmers. Darren soon begins to worry Reggie, so he goes to tell Mr. Tall but becomes preoccupied on his way because Truska, the bearded lady, put together a new set of clothes for Darren. Darren must then do Evra's chores as he is tending to his sick snake, and forgets about telling Mr. Tall about Reggie that day. A night of performance comes, as Mr. Tall finally gets wind of Reggie from Darren, but doubts that he can do any damage. But the Cirque did move along from that place, because of Reggie's threatening to call the police. Darren, who still refuses to drink human blood, decides not to perform and sets off. He hears a sound coming from the wolfman's cage, and decides to investigate. It was Reggie Veggie who was trying to free the wolf-man, but has no idea how violent the wolf man can be. After biting off Reggie's arms, the wolf-man sets off after a figure behind Darren, who has dropped a bag of clothes and onions which belong to Sam. Darren learns he was going to smuggle himself away with the circus. Eventually Sam is killed by the wolf man. While standing over Sam's corpse, Mr. Crepsley convinces Darren to drink Sam's blood, therefore ""preserving"" some of Sam's soul, including his love for pickled onions, as decided from a discussion of vampirism between Crepsley and Darren.

wikipedia-2284815," Vic Rattlehead  Vic Rattlehead is the mascot of the thrash metal band Megadeth. Vic is a skeletal figure who embodies the phrase, ""See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."" His eyes are covered by a riveted-on visor, his mouth is clamped shut, and his ears are closed with metal caps. His image appears on several Megadeth album covers. When the band started in 1985, he was on their first four album covers (1985–1990): ""Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!"", ""Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?"", ""So Far, So Good... So What!"", and ""Rust in Peace"". Vic did not appear on the front cover of any albums or compilations from 1991 to 2000. However, when Megadeth tried to bring back a more 'classic' vibe to their material, they also brought back their old mascot, and he returned for the 2001 album ""The World Needs a Hero"" and the 2004 album ""The System Has Failed"". Since then he has appeared on the band's 2007 studio album ""United Abominations"" (albeit in a different form, that is, of a human. He is identified by his visor, metal caps on his ears, and clamps on his mouth.). However, Vic was once again absent from the cover of ""Endgame"", and is instead found in the album's booklet. Vic is also found on the inside cover of ""Youthanasia"" and ""Countdown To Extinction"" and the 2005 compilation """". His portrait image can also be found by joining the spine labels of the 7 albums Mustaine re-released in 2004. Vic was mentioned in the band's 2010 video ""The Right to Go Insane"" and featured on the cover art for the ""Sudden Death"" single. On ""Th1rt3en"" Vic reappears, and can be seen with his back turned. Vic can be seen very faintly on the "" Super Collider"" album artwork as a reflection in the center of the particle collider, it is revealed inside the cover and on the back that Vic is the Super Collider. Creation. The mythic creation of Vic Rattlehead is addressed in the song ""Skull Beneath the Skin"" from the ""Killing is My Business... and Business is Good!"" album: In reality, Dave Mustaine sketched the original drawing of Vic for the cover art, but Combat Records lost the artwork and improvised a completely different result. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyZkVwRuBYQ&feature=related] The original artwork was supposed to be recovered and placed on the re-issue of ""Killing Is My Business...and Business is Good!""; however, this never came to pass. The name of Vic stands for victim and Rattlehead comes from what Mustaine's mother used to say to him when he was headbanging. ""Don't do that or you'll rattle something up in there!"" This then led to the expression ""to rattle one's head"" meaning head-bang. Redesign contest. On January 29, 2006, an official contest was announced on DeviantArt to redesign the Megadeth icon. The contest stated: ""After two decades of rocking, the heavy metal band Megadeth’s mascot Vic Rattlehead needs a facelift and the band has commissioned DeviantArt to redesign him!! Not only do you get the chance to redesign a mascot whose image has appeared on several Megadeth albums as well as a myriad of band merchandise, you can also win the BIGGEST prizes we've ever offered for a DeviantArt contest!""  The prizes were three different ESP electric guitars. The contest ended on February 14, 2006, and was judged by Dave Mustaine with the results posted on DeviantArt on March 15, 2006. Artists. The artists for the various incarnations of Vic include: ""United Abominations"". The cover art for Megadeth's eleventh album, ""United Abominations"", has revealed a redesigned Vic, using artwork from John Lorenzi, one of the DeviantArt contest entries, albeit not a winning entry. Vic now appears as an elderly man rather than a skeletal figure. He is, however, depicted with traits of the Four Horsemen mentioned in the album and shown inside the CD case—he is accompanied by an angel wearing white with blood-stained wings (an allusion to the Pestilence Horseman), has long black hair and a black cloak resembling the black horse of Famine, is wielding various firearms like the sword used by the War Horseman, and has pale, veinous-looking skin like that of Death, and is, of course, shown dealing death on a large scale. A reflection of the classic Vic can also be found on the far-right building on the front cover. "
wikipedia-2284839," Secondary mortgage market  The secondary mortgage market is the market for the sale of securities or bonds collateralized by the value of mortgage loans. A mortgage lender, commercial banks, or specialized firm will group together many loans (from the ""primary mortgage market"") and sell grouped loans known as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) or mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds. Mortgage-backed securities were often combined into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which may include other types of debt obligations such as corporate loans. The secondary mortgage market was intended to provided a new source of capital for the market when the traditional source in one market—such as thrifts in the United States—was unable to. It also was hoped to be more efficient than the old localized market for funds which might have a shortage or surplus depending on the location. In theory, the risk of default on individual loans was greatly reduced by this aggregation process, such that even high-risk individual loans could be treated as part of an AAA-risk (safest possible) investment. On the other hand mortgage securitization undid ""the connection between borrowers and lenders"", such that mortgage originators no longer had a direct incentive to make sure the lender could pay the loan. While historically in the US less than 2% of people lost their homes to foreclosure, rates were far higher during the Subprime mortgage crisis. Delinquencies, defaults, and decreased real estate values could make CDOs difficult to evaluate. This happened to BNP Paribas in August, 2007, causing the central banks to intervene with liquidity. "
wikipedia-2284853," 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen  The 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ""Prinz Eugen"" was a German mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Formed in 1941 from ""Volksdeutsche"" (ethnic German) volunteers and conscripts from the Banat, Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Hungary and Romania, it fought a counter-insurgency campaign against communist-led Yugoslav Partisan resistance forces in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, NDH and Montenegro. It was given the title ""Prinz Eugen"" after Prince Eugene of Savoy, an outstanding military leader of the Habsburg Empire who liberated the Banat and Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718. It was initially named the SS-""Freiwilligen""-Division ""Prinz Eugen"" (SS-Volunteer Division ""Prinz Eugen""). Background. After the invasion, occupation and dismantling of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941, the Wehrmacht placed Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica) and the Banat under a military government. Formation. The division was formed in late 1941 following the Invasion of Yugoslavia, initially from German-speaking Danube Swabian ""Selbstschutz"" in the Banat, which was an autonomous area within the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. A key figure in the organisation of the division was the Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia, ""SS-Obergruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei"" (Police General) August Meyszner. ""After the initial rush of ""Volksdeutsche"" to join, voluntary enlistments tapered off, and the new formation did not reach division size. Therefore, in August 1941, the SS discarded the voluntary approach, and after a favorable judgement from the SS court in Belgrade, imposed a mandatory military obligation on all ""Volksdeutsche"" in Banat, the first of its kind for non-Reich Germans. One of the reasons for the forced conscription of ethnic Germans was the disappointingly low amount of volunteers for the division after the initial recruitments (no more than 5000). While the division remained ""volunteer"" in name, few of the conscripted ethnic Germans actively sought entry into the unit. ""SS Reichsführer"" Himmler had announced that the wishes of the ""Volksdeutsche"" were irrelevant, while in connection with the Balkan Germans the SS head of recruitment Gottlob Berger remarked: """"kein Mensch [sich ja darum, was wir unten mit unseren Volksdeutschen tun"""" (""no person cares what we do with our ethnic Germans in the South""). Ethnic Germans in the Balkans were therefore powerless and could not oppose conscription into the SS. The unwillingness of ethnic Germans to serve in the unit is illustrated by a mutiny of 173 Croatian Germans of the division  in 1943 in Bosnia. Apparently the men of mixed ancestry did not speak German and were mistreated by their superiors as a result. Himmler intervened personally in the problem and even ordered any NCO that insulted the mother of the Croatian German troops to be shot on the spot (the insulting of mothers being common in the Balkans). Many of these men preferred service in the Croatian Home Guard for a variety of reasons. In 1942, the Pančevo-based unit was declared a Mountain Division. They were issued with a significant amount of non-standard German weapons and used captured equipment such as Czech machine guns like the ZB-53 and French light tanks. They were provided with excellent German-made mountain artillery such as the 10.5 cm Gebirgshaubitze 40 howitzer and 7.5 cm Gebirgsgeschütz 36 mountain gun. When the division was formed, it was assigned to the Balkans as an anti-Partisan mountain division. 1942. In October 1942, the division led a German-Bulgarian anti-guerrilla offensive against the Chetniks in the Kopaonik, Goč and Jastrebac mountains of the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The operation was aimed at the destruction of the Rasina Corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, commanded by Major Dragutin Keserović, whose headquarters was located in the village of Kriva Reka. Germans and Bulgarians cleared the Chetnik free territory and in the process committed war crimes against the Serbian civilian population. The Chetniks successfully withdrew from the German-Bulgarian ring to territory that was beyond the reach of the occupation forces. Keserović and his troops had been participating in military operations against the Bulgarians and Germans for the previous year. The Chetniks were a threat to the Germans because they were able to break the German road communications and interfere with the movement of war materiel intended for Rommel′s forces on the African front—through the Morava−Vardar valley. Losses were inflicted on Keserovićev′s detachments and the local population by the constantly pursuing enemy forces. The Germans, worried about a potential attack on the Trepča mine near Kosovska Mitrovica, from which they pulled significant amounts of lead and zinc, decided in the spring of 1942 to launch an attack involving some 20,000 soldiers. In early October 1942 the division was deployed in southwestern Serbia, in Kraljevo, Užice, Ivanjica, Čačak, Raška, Kosovska Mitrovica, and Novi Pazar. Elements of the 9th Bulgarian Infantry Division were also assigned to the attack. The Rasina Corps at that time had about 1,500 fighters under arms. On 5 October 1942 Phleps ordered the German and Bulgarian forces to destroy the Chetnik forces. A comprehensive attack was planned: 20,000 well-armed and fully trained German troops would encircle the Serbians from four directions using a precisely defined plan of fire. Because of the perceived importance of this operation and to observe the first military operations of the newly established SS Division, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler travelled to Kraljevo in the German occupation zone. Himmler was in Kraljevo from 15 to 18 October 1942 and toured the division. German and Bulgarian forces began their attack on the Chetnik territory at dawn on 12 October 1942. As planned, the attack proceeded from four directions. German combat group ""North"" marched to the top of Željin, and a secondary group to the top of Kavalj. Combat group ""South"" conducted a comprehensive movement in the area around Gobelja, located 17 km northwest of Raška. Combat group ""West"" concentrated its forces in the valley 5 km from Banje. Combat group ""East"" took a position west of Brus. Germans and Bulgarians made a ring around the Chetnik territory and forced the peasants into hiding. German combat groups ""North"", ""West"", and ""South"" proceeded along a front through the Chetnik territory in the direction of combat group ""East"", which was assigned the role of forming a wall to stop the Chetniks. However, Keserović had intelligence about the preparations and the movement of large German forces for an attack, and did not consider it useful to meet the German and Bulgarian forces on a wide front. He ordered his units to regroup into smaller squads for easy maneuvering and penetration. His tactic meant the Chetnik Rasina Corps was able to escape from the ring of enemy soldiers. The Germans and Bulgarians committed reprisals against the civilian population and burned several villages. The village of Kriva Reka, the location of Keserović's headquarters, suffered the most: 120 civilians were locked in the village church and burned to death by members of the 7th SS Division. In other villages in Kopaonik 300 civilians were killed; in the villages on Mount Goč 250 civilians were executed. The Germans killed a total of 670 civilians during this operation. The division's next action was in the Serbian-Montenegro border in the mountains east of the Ibar River and afterwards it took part in the Fourth anti-Partisan Offensive in the Zagreb-Karlovac area, where together with Italian forces attempted to defeat the Partisans commanded by Josip Broz Tito, the operation failed and most of the Partisans managed to evade the main attack. 1943. In Operation Weiss I, the Division advanced from Karlovac area against NOVJ units resistance and on January 29 captured informal partisan capital Bihać. In Operation Weiss II it forced its way from western Bosnia to Mostar area in Hercegovina and also deployed units northwest of Sarajevo. In May the Division took part in operation against Chetniks. The Operation was successful and Draža Mihailović was forced to retreat to Serbia with his headquarters. From 15 May-15 June, the division took a part in the Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive (Operation Schwartz) aiming to pin Tito's main force of about 20,000 Partisans against the Zelengora mountain, in southeastern Bosnia. During the battle, the division received a task to move through the Italian zone in order to block the possible advance of Partisans towards the Adriatic sea and Albania, to close the south-east part of the encirclement and then advance north over mountainous terrain to crush the Partisan forces. In 11-day fightings from May 20 division captured Šavnik. For this success major (""Sturmbannführer"") Dietsche as well as commander Phleps received first two Knight's Crosses for the division. In the following days the focal point of the battle shifted westward. After the main group of the Partisans headed by 1st Proletarian Division broke out of the encirclement, two battalions of the division that were moved to cover the left bank of the Sutjeska river and block the Partisan's escape route were surprised by the attack of three battalions of 1st Dalmatian and one from 5th Montenegro Brigade at Tjentište pushing them back. They recovered their positions during a night battle and decimated most Partisan units. In the operation Schwartz the division suffered total losses of 613 men. In August 1943, the division became a part of the XV Mountain Corps and was sent to the Dalmatian coast, to disarm the Italian forces in September 1943 after the Italian Government had surrendered to the Allies. In exploiting Italian capitulation, NOVJ succeeded in seizing control of the most part of the Dalmatian coast. In sixteen-days long battle the division, together with 92nd Motorized Regiment, pushed back NOVJ units and on September 29 reoccupied Split. In October, division participated in Operation Landsturm, another anti-Partisan operation in Omiš, Ploče and Biokovo. In battles for Split and Biokovo coastline, division suffered losses of 1582 killed, wounded and missing in action. The division was reorganized on 22 October 1943 and was renamed the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ""Prinz Eugen"". In November, the unit was attached to the V SS Mountain Corps and took part in anti-Partisan Operations Kugelblitz and Schneesturm in December 1943. 1944. In January 1944 the division was involved in more anti-Partisan actions in operation ""Waldrausch"". In May division took part in Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive (""Operation Rösselsprung"") which began on 25 May 1944. This operation had the task of killing or capturing Tito, and the operation was spearheaded by the 500th ""SS Fallschirmjäger-Bataillon"" and supported by the Brandenburg Regiment. In May June and July, the division also saw action in operations ""Freie Jagd"", ""Rose"" and ""Feuerwehr"" . In August (12–30 August) the division was engaged in operation ""Rübezahl"", aimed to prevent offensive of NOVJ forces from Montenegro into western Serbia. In September, the Soviet Red Army had advanced to the Balkans and the division suffered heavy casualties in defensive battles against Bulgarian, Soviet and NOVJ forces in the Nish region. On 21 September, ""Obergruppenführer"" Artur Phleps—the division’s first commander—was believed to have been killed when en route from Montenegro to Transylvania. The division's next action was the defence of the Kraljevo Bridgehead (""Brückenkopf Kraljevo"") as the part of Army Corps Müller. This defence was essential for the success of Army Group E efforts to open a corridor which would allow the retreat of 350,000 German soldiers from Greece and the Aegean. In the beginning of November, the SS 1st Albanian ""Skanderbeg"" Division was disbanded and its remnants incorporated into the 14th Regiment of ""Prinz Eugen"", which received its honor title ""Skanderbeg"". 1945. In January 1945, the division was again in action against the Yugoslav army at Otok and Vukovar. In February it took part in Operation Wehrwolf against Yugoslav bridgehead in the Virovitica area. The retreat from Bosnia continued and ""Prinz Eugen"" retreated through the NDH in April 1945. On 10 May, the division retreated towards Celje in Slovenia where it surrendered on 11May to Yugoslav forces. War crimes. The division is infamous for its cruelty and massive atrocities committed in the area of Nikšić in Montenegro: Commanders. The following officers commanded the division: Awards. Several members were decorated with high German military awards, including one Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oaks Leaves and Swords awarded to ""SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS"" Otto Kumm when he was the divisional commander. Divisional recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross included the first commander of the division, Artur Phleps and five others, all regimental or battalion commanders. One was awarded posthumously. "
wikipedia-2284882," Clay Shirky  Clay Shirky (born 1964) is an American writer, consultant and teacher on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies. He has a joint appointment at New York University (NYU) as a Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute and Assistant Arts Professor in the New Media focused graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). His courses address, among other things, the interrelated effects of the topology of social networks and technological networks, how our networks shape culture and vice-versa. He has written and been interviewed about the Internet since 1996. His columns and writings have appeared in ""Business 2.0"", the ""New York Times"", the ""Wall Street Journal"", the ""Harvard Business Review"" and ""Wired"". Shirky divides his time between consulting, teaching, and writing on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies. His consulting practice is focused on the rise of decentralized technologies such as peer-to-peer, web services, and wireless networks that provide alternatives to the wired client–server infrastructure that characterizes the World Wide Web. He is a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Advisory Board. In ""The Long Tail"", Chris Anderson calls Shirky ""a prominent thinker on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies."" Education and career. After graduating from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in fine art in 1986, he moved to New York. In the 1990s he founded the Hard Place Theater, a theatre company that produced non-fiction theater using only found materials such as government documents, transcripts and cultural records. and also worked as a lighting designer for other theater and dance companies, including the Wooster Group, Elevator Repair Service and Dana Reitz. During this time, Shirky was vice-president of the New York chapter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and wrote technology guides for Ziff Davis. He appeared as an expert witness on cyberculture in ""Shea v. Reno"", a case cited in the U. S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Communications Decency Act in 1996. Shirky was the first Professor of New Media in the Media Studies department at Hunter College, where he developed the MFA in Integrated Media Arts program. In the fall of 2010, Shirky was a visiting Morrow Lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government instructing a course titled: ""New Media and Public Action"". Views. In his book ""Here Comes Everybody"", Shirky explains how he has long spoken in favor of crowdsourcing and collaborative efforts online. He uses the phrase ""the Internet runs on love"" to describe the nature of such collaborations. In the book, he discusses the ways in which the action of a group adds up to something more than just aggregated individual action borrowing the phrase ""more is different"" from physicist Philip Warren Anderson. Shirky asserts that collaborative crowdsourced work results from ""a successful fusion of a plausible promise, and effective tool and an acceptable bargain with the users."" He states that the promise of what the user will get out of participating in a project leads to a person's desire to get involved. Collaborators will then choose the best social networking tool to do the job. One that ""must be designed to fit the job being done, and it must help people do something they actually want to do."" The bargain, Shirky states, defines what collaborators expect from each other's participation in the project. Shirky's 'Promise, Tool, Bargain' premise restates aspects of the Uses and Gratifications Theory of mass media research. He points to four key steps. The first is sharing, a sort of “me-first collaboration” in which the social effects are aggregated after the fact; people share links, URLs, tags, and eventually come together around a type. This type of sharing is a reverse of the so-called old order of sharing, where participants congregate first and then share (examples include Flickr, and Delicious). The second is conversation, that is, the synchronization of people with each other and the coming together to learn more about something and to get better at it. The third is collaboration, in which a group forms under the purpose of some common effort. It requires a division of labor, and teamwork. It can often be characterized by people wanting to fix a market failure, and is motivated by increasing accessibility. The fourth and final step is collective action, which Shirky says is “mainly still in the future.” The key point about collective action is that the fate of the group as a whole becomes important. Shirky also introduces his theory of Mass Amateurization: Combined with the lowering of transaction costs associated with creating content, ""mass amateurization"" of publishing changes the question from ""Why publish this?"" to ""Why not?"" Tied to ""mass amateurization"" is the idea of ""publish-then-filter"" which is now required due to the mere size and amount of material being created on a daily basis. Shirky calls this ""mass amateurization of filtering"" a forced move. He uses the Portland Pattern Repository which became Wikipedia as an example of this new marriage of mass content creation and mass filtering. In 2010 Shirky published """" which expands on themes introduced in Here Comes Everybody. The book follows concepts he introduced in a Web 2. 0 conference presentation April 23, 2008 called ""Gin, Television, and Social Surplus"", Herein he popularizes the concept of ""cognitive surplus"", the time freed from watching television which can be enormously productive when applied to other social endeavors. Technology has turned many past consumers into producers. This new production capacity, combined with humanity's willingness to share, can change society if applied to ""civic"" endeavors. Shirky introduces Cognitive Surplus as a continuation of his work in ""Here Comes Everybody"". ""This book picks up where that one left off, starting with the observation that the wiring of humanity lets us treat free time as a shared global resource, and lets us design new kinds of participation and sharing that take advantage of that resource."" Shirky has also written about ""algorithmic authority,"" which describes the process through which unverified information is vetted for its trustworthiness through multiple sources. Institutions vs collaboration. In July 2005, Shirky gave a talk entitled ""Institutions vs collaboration"" as a part of TEDGlobal 2005. This presentation reveals many of the ideas and concepts that would ultimately be presented in Here Comes Everybody and in future TED talks. Shirky compares the ""coordination costs"" between groups formed under traditional institutions and those formed by groups which ""build cooperation into the infrastructure."" Classic institutions have to create economic, management, legal and physical structures and inherently, by creating these rigid structures, must exclude large numbers of people. Companies like Flickr, however, since they built ""cooperation into the infrastructure"" of their company, do not have to build massive infrastructure nor exclude large groups of potential contributors. Shirky states that since many social systems follow the Pareto principle wherein 20% of contributors account for 80% of contributions, traditional institutions lose out of the long tail of contributors by turning only the few that dominate the distribution into employees. The ""cooperative infrastructure"" model escapes having to lose this resource. Shirky presents an ""institution as enabler"" and ""institution as obstacle concept"". For the few, high-volume contributors, they can be assimilated, as employees, into the old-style corporate model thus can live in an ""institution-as-enabler world"". The long tail of contributors, however, who make few and infrequent contributions, see institutions as an obstacle as they would never have been hired, therefore, disenfranchised. Shirky argues that an idea or contribution may be infrequent and significant. Furthermore, all of the long tail contributors, taken in aggregate, can be substantial. One pitfall of the ""mass amateurs"" creating their own groups is that not all niches that are filled will be positive ones; Shirky presents pro-ana groups as an example. Shirky closes by stating that the migration from institutions to self-organizing, collaborative groups will not be a complete migration and will not end in a utopian society. Rather chaos will follow as the printing press before it created and that this period of transition will last roughly fifty years. Evolution of asymmetric media. In June 2009, Shirky participated in a TED@State talk entitled ""How cellphones, Twitter and Facebook can make history"" aka ""How social media can make history."" In the talk, he explains that this is the first time in history that communication is possible from many, to many. In the past, communication to a large group excluded the possibility of having a conversation, and having a conversation meant not interacting with a group but was necessarily a one-to-one structure. Shirky labels this incongruous exchange as asymmetric. This feature is one of the main reasons that the internet revolution is different from communication revolutions that proceeded it. The second difference between the twentieth and twenty-first century communication revolution, Shirky states, is now all media is digitized. This means that the Internet now encapsulates all forms of media from the past and the medium itself has become the site of exchange, just not a means of exchange. Finally, the Internet allows people to create content thus the line between producers and consumers has become blurred. As Shirky puts it, ""Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape, a new producer joins as well."" Even countries like China, as Shirky gives as an example, go to great lengths to control information exchange on the Internet but are having trouble as the ""amateurization"" of media creation has effectively turned every owner of a cellphone and Twitter account into a journalist. The populace as a whole, Shirky claims, is a force much harder to control than a handful of professional news sources. He compares the ""Great Firewall of China"" to the Maginot Line as both were built to protect from external threats but that is not where the majority of content is being created in this new media landscape. As an example of the potential of this two-way, collaborative environment, Shirky believes we are now living in, he presents as a case study MyBarackObama.com. Over the issue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, members of the website were upset of Obama's announcement that he was changing his stance and that now he was going to sign the bill ""that granted immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons."" Despite the disagreement between the President and the posters opposed to his altered view, Shirky cites the mere fact that the President posted a reply to their concerns, instead of persecuting/ignoring the group, as hope for the future of this new form of mass media. The Shirky principle. In April 2010, Kevin Kelly cited the phrase ""Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution,"" and called it the ""Shirky Principle"", as the phrasing reminded him of the clarity of the Peter Principle. Communal value vs civic value. In June 2010, Shirky participated in TED@Cannes wherein he spoke about ""cognitive surplus"" and its role furthering ""communal"" and ""civic value"". The talk was entitled, ""How cognitive surplus will change the world,"" and the possibility for change, which Shirky presents, runs the spectrum at one end with ""communal value"" being increased and at the other end with ""civic value"" being furthered. Digital technology has allowed human generosity and ""the world's free time and talents,"" which Shirky calls ""cognitive surplus"", to combine and create a new form of creative expression. This creative expression can take the form of lolcats or endeavors such as Ushahidi; the former Shirky says increases ""communal value"", ""it is created by the participants for each other"" for simple amusement, whereas the latter he sites furthers ""civic value"" meaning the group action is taken to benefit society as a whole. Shirky then presents the view that society lives under ""social constraint"" and that these ""social constraints"" can create a culture that is ""more generous than"" the environment created by ""contractual constraints"" alone. Understanding where the economic or ""contractual"" motivation of a situation ends and where the ""social"" part begins, Shirky claims is key when designing to maximize generosity. This being the case, to have society use its ""trillion hours a year of participatory value"" to advance ""civic value"", society itself simply needs to prize, and collectively praise, endeavors like Ushahidi. Response to Evgeny Morozov. In March 2011, Shirky responded to questions raised by Evgeny Morozov about consulting he had done for the Libyan government. Shirky explained that he had been invited in 2007 to speak in Boston to Libya's IT Minister. Shirky stated that the talk was ""about using social software to improve citizen engagement in coastal towns. The idea was that those cities would be more economically successful if local policies related to the tourist trade were designed by the locals themselves."" Shirky added that nothing came of the project beyond his initial talk. He defended his underlying desire to expand representative government in Libya and concluded that ""the best reason to believe that social media can aid citizens in their struggle to make government more responsive is that both citizens and governments believe that."" Reaction to SOPA. In January 2012, at TED Salon NY, Shirky gave a talk entitled ""Why SOPA is a bad idea."" He cites SOPA as a way for traditional, mass media producers to, ""raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs."" After an offending internet site is identified, the identification process itself is not specified in the bill, the targeted site will be removed from the Domain Name System (DNS). Shirky claims since you can still use the static ip address of the site in question, removal from DNS is futile. He identifies the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 as a law that was able to delineate between sharing with your friends as being legal and selling for commercial gain as illegal. Unsatisfied, media companies, Shirky claims, continued to push government to create more sweeping legislation which would hinder any form of sharing. This pressure, in 1998, created the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was now legal for media companies to sell uncopyable material although uncopyable digital material does not exist. To remedy this fact, Shirky states that media companies now tried to break consumer's computer hardware to create the illusion that the media they purchased was indeed uncopyable. Whereas DMCA was ""surgical,"" SOPA is ""nuclear"" since the law stipulates any sites pointing to ""illegal"" content may be censored. Ultimately, Shirky points out the public-at-large is by far the largest producers of content and they are the ones that which will be censured. They will be presumed guilty until they can prove that the content they published is not illegal. This turns the American legal system on its head. He closes by encouraging Americans to contact their senators and congressmen and reminding them they ""don't like to be treated like a thief."" Distributed version control and democracy. On June 29, 2012, Shirky participated in Session 12: Public Sphere of TEDGlobal 2012. Shirky made the observation that many of the technological advancements in communication throughout history, from the printing press to the television, were heralded as harbingers of world peace yet ended up creating greater dissent. ""The more ideas there are in circulation, the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with."" However, Shirky claims, with this increased ""arguing,"" comes an increased ""speed"" of information exchange. Shirky cites ""The Invisible College"" as an example of a group that was able to utilize this effect created by the printing press, via the scientific journal, to help launch the scientific revolution. He then states we are in a similar period today with open-source programmers and their use of distributed version control or DVCS. DVCS, he argues, allows for ""more arguments"" to be made into ""better arguments"". DVCS also allows for ""cooperation without coordination"" which Shirky states is ""the big change"". He then suggests that DVCS fits naturally with law as it, and software development, are ""dependency-related."" Another application for DVCS, which Shirky presents, is the crafting of legislation and uses Open Legislation, a listing of legislative information from the New York State Senate and Assembly, as an early step in that direction. The talk culminates with Shirky posing the open question of whether or not government will transition from striving towards one-way transparency to mutual collaboration and suggests if it does there is already a ""new form of arguing"" centered around DVCS to aid the transition.

In June 2012, the editors announced that they were gathering nominations for a new book of Crap Towns. Controversy. Publication of ""Crap Towns"" brought widespread criticism from residents, politicians and other notable figures from the towns listed. The editors of the book wrote to ""local worthies"" in each of the nominated towns to gain their responses and views. Local newspapers, such as the ""Stockport Express"" were also quick to defend 'their' towns, whilst some national commentators, such as Sarfraz Manzoor in ""The Guardian"" tended to agree with the result as a person who used to live in the town. However the article was summed up with the quotation ""There is, of course, an unmistakeable air of snobbery around the people behind such a book; the stench of rich kids having fun at the expense of those less able to afford to be professionally idle.

wikipedia-2284928," Kafi  Kafi (, Hindi: काफ़ी), Sindhi:ڪافي) is a classical form of Sufi poetry, mostly in Punjabi, Sindhi and Seraiki languages and originating from the Punjab and Sindh regions of the Indian subcontinent. Some well-known Kafi poets are Baba Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast and Khwaja Ghulam Farid. This poetry style has also lent itself to the Kafi genre of singing, popular throughout South Asia, especially Pakistan and India. Over the years, both Kafi poetry and its rendition have experienced rapid growth phases as various poets and vocalists added their own influences to the form, creating a rich and varied poetic form, yet through it all it remained centered on the dialogue between the Soul and the Creator, symbolized by the murid (disciple) and his Murshid (Master), and often by lover and his Beloved. The word Kafi is derived from the Arabic ""kafa"" meaning group. The genre is said to be derived from the Arabic poetry genre, ""qasidah"", a monorhyme ode that is always meant to be sung, using one or two lines as a refrain that is repeated to create a mood. Kafi poetry is usually themed around heroic and great romantic tales from the folkfore, often used as a metaphor for mystical truths, and spiritual longing. Kafi singing. In musical terms, kafi refers to the genre of Punjabi, Sindhi, and Seraiki classical music which utilizes the verses of kafi poets such as Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain. Kafi music is devotional music, normally associated with the Sufi orders or ""Tariqah"" of Islam in South Asia, and was sung by dervishes or fakirs (Islamic mendicants), solo or in groups, as an offering to their murshid, spiritual guide.  It is characterized by a devotional intensity in its delivery, and as such overlaps considerably with the Qawwali genre. Just like Qawwali, its performances often took place at the dargahs (mausoleums) of various Sufi saints in the region. However, unlike Qawwali, the musical arrangement is much simpler and may only include one harmonium, one tabla, one dholak and a single vocalist. The emphasis remains on the words rather than the music itself, since the central aim of Kafi music is to convey the essence of the mystical lyrics. The central verse is often repeated. There are no fixed styles of singing of Kafi. Traditionally dervishes in Sindh used instruments like ""Yaktaro"", a one-stringed plucked instrument, and wooden clappers, ""chappars"", though many contemporary singers have chosen their own variations Rise of Kafi singing. Some of the early notable exponents of this form in the 1930s, when classical singing became highly popular, were Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana, who used the dhrupad style in his rendition of Sindhi Kafis, and his contemporary in Sindhi kafi singing, Ustad Allahdino Noonari, who used the fusion form. Kafi has gained a higher profile in the West in the late 20th century, thanks to the Pakistani singer Abida Parveen, who, like qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, has performed before Western audiences.

wikipedia-2284936," Downtown Cleveland  Downtown Cleveland is the central business district of the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, United States. Reinvestment in the area in the mid-1990s spurred a rebirth that continues to this day, with over $3.5 billion in residential and commercial developments slated for the area over the next few years. While much of the city's population decamped to surrounding suburbs in the second half of the 20th century, downtown Cleveland gained population in the first decade of the 21st century, growing from 7,261 in 1990 to 9,599 as of the 2000 Census. In 2005, the Brookings Institution called it one of America's ""Emerging Downtowns"" because of its 32.2% growth over the period. As of the 2010 Census the population of Downtown Cleveland was 11,693 making it the biggest downtown district in Ohio. Downtown Cleveland workforce numbers over 100,000, and the central business district contains over 16 million square feet of rentable office space. Both these commercial statistics lead the state of Ohio. Public Square. The heart of downtown and the city's first settled area, Public Square was laid out by city founder Moses Cleaveland in 1796 and has remained largely unchanged. It consists of a large open space, cut into quadrants by Ontario Street and Superior Avenue. Public Square is the symbolic heart of the city, and has hosted presidents, vast congregations of people, and a free annual 4th of July concert by the Cleveland Orchestra. At one time, Public Square was fenced off and inaccessible to vehicles. In 1860, the Perry Monument, a memorial to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's victory in the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, was dedicated in the center of Public Square. In 1892, it was moved out of the square, which by then had the fences removed after lobbying by commercial interests. Public Square is also home to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, which commemorates residents of Cuyahoga County who served in the Civil War. Public Square also features a statue of Cleaveland; a statue of Tom L. Johnson, the city's most famous mayor; a large amount of shrubbery and other landscaping; and a large public fountain. The Consulate-General of Slovenia in Cleveland is in the 55 Public Square building. Notable buildings on Public Square include the Terminal Tower, home to Tower City Center, 200 Public Square - the former BP Building (renamed in 2005), as well as Key Tower, the tallest building in Ohio and one of the tallest in the United States. Public Square is also home to the historic Old Stone Church, completed in 1855. The west side of Public Square was to become the headquarters of the Cleveland Trust Company, then called Ameritrust, but the project was cancelled after Ameritrust was purchased and merged into Key Bank, leaving that side of the square open to this day, with only a surface parking lot on the site. The classic Higbee's department store building is home to the Cleveland Horseshoe Casino, since its opening on May 14, 2012. Historic Warehouse District. Originally an early residential neighborhood, The Warehouse District was built into a warehousing and shipping neighborhood during the industrial rise of Cleveland, Within the past few decades, it has been converted again back into an entertainment, dining, and residential hub. The Warehouse District is the largest downtown neighborhood by population, and continues to grow with an assortment of shops, clubs, bars, and loft condos/apartments. West Sixth Street is known as the heart of the district. Famously, the 17-story Rockefeller Building sits on the corner West Sixth and Superior Ave erected by John D. Rockefeller. Historic Gateway District. Revitalization of the Historic Gateway District began in the 1990s with the Gateway Project, which included construction of Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena, the homes of the MLB Cleveland Indians, NBA Cleveland Cavaliers, AFL Cleveland Gladiators, and AHL Lake Erie Monsters. The Gateway complex was built on parking lots on the site of a former produce market. The baseball stadium and basketball arena are connected to Tower City Center, and RTA's rail transit system, via an enclosed walkway. The neighborhood includes retail, housing, and a large variety of restaurants. East 4th Street is a popular restaurant and entertainment street near Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena. It is home to Cleveland's House of Blues, ""Iron Chef"" Michael Symon's Lola Bistro, comedy club/restaurant Pickwick and Frolic, as well as a dozen other dining and retail storefronts. The neighborhood is home to hundreds of residents who live in the apartments and loft condominiums above the storefronts. The neighborhood also houses the Cleveland Arcade, the first indoor shopping mall in the United States. Theater District. Home to the second-largest performing arts complex in the U.S., Playhouse Square Center in the Cleveland Theater District is downtown's cultural heart. The area is dominated by five historic theater built during the 1920s -- State, Ohio, Allen, Hanna, and Palace theaters are all located in a cluster near the intersection of Euclid Avenue and E. 14th Street. Additionally, the smaller theaters include the 14th Street Theater, Kennedy's Theater, Westfield Insurance Studio Theater, Second Stage, and Helen Rosenfeld Lewis Bialosky Lab Theatre. WVIZ-TV 25 (PBS), WCPN FM 90.3 (NPR), and classical music station WCLV FM 104.9 (collectively known as ""Ideastream"") teamed up with Playhouse Square to renovate the former Playhouse Square Building, an empty office building, transforming it into One Playhouse Square, a downtown broadcast headquarters. The building is now known as the Idea Center, and includes high definition television studios, control rooms, radio studios, and performance space fronting Euclid Avenue, as well as a variety of high-tech business startups and other tenants located on the building's upper floors. Residents of the district include Cleveland Playhouse and Cleveland State University performing arts. The outdoor streetscape is undergoing a $16 million transformation to be completed 2014. Focusing primary on lighting and signage, the centerpiece will be a 4,600-piece LED crystal chandelier measuring 24-feet tall and will be hung over the Euclid Ave and East 14th Street intersection. Other additions include four gateway signs spanning entry points, a large 1920's-era “Playhouse Square” sign at East 13th Street and Euclid Ave intersection, a fire pit at Star Plaza, a 28-foot-tall digital display, and architectural lighting to show off details of the historic buildings. Civic Center. The Civic Center district holds Cleveland's governmental and public buildings. The most visible structure is the Justice Center Complex, consisting of the Cleveland Police Department headquarters and Cuyahoga County Jail. Other notable structures include Cleveland City Hall, Cuyahoga County and Cleveland Municipal Courts, Public Auditorium, Cleveland Public Library main buildings, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse, and the Cleveland Metropolitan School District administration building.

On the eastern edge sits Fort Huntington Park, containing a statue of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry commemorating the Battle of Lake Erie, a statue of Clevelander Jesse Owens, and the Cleveland Police Department memorial of officers killed in the line of duty. A major addition to the area is the $465 million Global Center for Health Innovation and Cleveland Convention Center. Financial District. Cleveland's financial district, the area around East 9th street from Lake Erie south to Prospect Avenue, serves as corporate or regional home to many firms in the financial, business, legal, communications and publishing sectors of the city's economy. Architecturally, the area is characterized by large, glass office towers built predominately in the 1950s to 1980s. The tallest is Erieview Tower at 40-stories, the centerpiece of the largely unbuilt Erieview Urban Renewal Project of the 1960s. The Galleria was added to the tower in the 1980s originally as a shopping mall, but today serves as a mix of small stores, office space, ""gardens under the glass"", radio headquarters, and a food court. The 31-story One Cleveland Center is nicknamed the ""silver chisel"" due to its distinct shape. The seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, is located at the heart of the district on E.9th. There is a large cluster of high-rise downtown housing in this area, largely concentrated in the East 12th Street area. The district is home to PNC Financial Services regional offices, law firm Jones Day, Alexander Mann U.S. headquarters, and Amtrust Financial regional headquarters, and Medical Mutual headquarters. Famously, the City Club of Cleveland, housed in the City Club Building, is known as the longest continuous independent free speech forum in the country.

At the heart of the district located at the intersection of Euclid Ave and E.9th Street, the Ameritrust complex is undergoing a complete revitalization and new construction. A historic rotunda, 29-story tower, and assorted office buildings are all set to be turned into a mixed-use complex of apartments, a hotel, and office space. The Cuyahoga County governmental headquarters is set to be built as an 8-story office tower connected to the main complex. North Coast Harbor District. Home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Great Lakes Science Center, Cleveland Browns Stadium, Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum and the USS ""Cod"", North Coast Harbor is the tourist district of downtown Cleveland. The North Coast District is home to the city's port, although there are long-term plans to move the port west of the river and open up the area for housing and lakefront development. North Coast is also the former home of Cleveland Stadium. The city was once known to some as the ""Mistake on the Lake"" although this pejorative has fallen out of common use. Cleveland Stadium was torn down after the former Cleveland Browns franchise left the city in 1995, and was replaced with Cleveland Browns Stadium, which serves as the home of the reborn NFL football franchise. Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport is located east of the Rock Hall, and serves as a commuter and business airport that reduces small aircraft traffic at the larger Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, located southwest of downtown. The district fronts Lake Erie on the north and also includes Voinovich Park and a fishing pier. Plans for the city's lakefront include adding thousands of housing units, retail shops, a marina, and other amenities to North Coast Harbor, see ""Lakefront Plan"" below. Campus District. The Campus District is a downtown Cleveland neighborhood just east of the central business district. The district is bordered by Lakeside Avenue to the north, Broadway Avenue to the south, East 18th Street to the west and East 30th Street to the east. Members of the Campus District include Cleveland State University, St. Vincent Charity Medical Center, Cuyahoga Community College and more. Cleveland State University has in past years been derided as an open enrollment commuter school, but has moved to dispel that belief. The university is progressing through a master plan to raise standards, enrollment, and rebuild its fortress-like campus. CSU plans to build a college town adjacent to downtown, including new retail, restaurants and housing to serve an increase of resident students planned to be in the thousands. The university's desire to attract more traditional college students and begin to raise its stature as a research university figure into these plans a great deal, and CSU opened its second residence hall, a complete retrofit of Fenn Tower, in the fall of 2006. Over the past decade, CSU has partnered with the city and other area stakeholders to transfer technology research into startup companies and enterprises, improving the economy of the area and stimulating downtown life in the Quadrangle. As part of CSU, the Wolstein Center, formerly the CSU Convocation Center, is located in the Campus District, and serves as the home of CSU Men's Basketball and various concerts and special events throughout the year. Flats district. The Cuyahoga River splits The Flats in half where the two sides are referred to appropriately as the East Bank of the Flats and the West Bank of the Flats. While the East Bank of the Flats was once the popular nightlife district in Ohio, it's demise in the early 2000s spurred a complete redevelopment where a majority of the existing buildings were demolished. In its place, an 8-story Aloft Hotel and a 21-story office tower were built. Restaurants, apartments, and a riverside promenade are planned for Phase II of this mixed-use project. The West Bank of the Flats contains a the majority of the district's residential population, primary stemming from a set of apartments and condos known as Stonebridge. The areas also boasts bars, restaurants, jet ski rental, strip clubs, and, most recently, the home of the Greater Cleveland Aquarium. Historically significant, the Flats were the place Moses Cleaveland first landed when he founded the city. It was also the location of some of the earliest populations of Cleveland. Throughout much of Cleveland history, it became almost entirely industrial. By the 1980s, it had become the famous nightlife area that lasted until the early 2000s. The current state of the Flats is in mixed-use redevelopment. New developments and projects. Euclid Corridor. The $197 million Euclid Corridor Transportation Project connected downtown, Midtown, and University Circle by introducing bus rapid transit (BRT) to the city in the form of the HealthLine. The project involved a total reconstruction of Euclid Avenue from Public Square to beyond University Circle (located approximately east of downtown), and included bus-only lanes with center-median station boarding, priority signaling, and fast commute times. In addition to transit and road improvements, the transportation project also invested heavily in the Euclid Avenue streetscape, rebuilding the street from storefront to storefront, removing old vaults and streetcar tracks, and building new sidewalks, lighting, and landscaping. The project included a large public arts component, with different areas of the Euclid Corridor route being addressed by local and national artists. The project is expected to spur investments in residential, retail, office, and mixed-use redevelopments, including over 4,000 residential units along the corridor. In addition to the BRT line, the Downtown Cleveland Alliance funded a study on retail feasibility on the avenue, focusing on the area between CSU and Public Square. Global Center for Health Innovation and Cleveland Convention Center. A $465 million Global Center for Health Innovation, previously known as the Medical Mart, and Cleveland Convention Center are set to open summer 2013.

Work at both stations includes replacing brick and concrete pavers, repairing the glass shelters, and demolishing ticket booths. At Settlers Landing, crews will restore eight etched glass panels that act as wind screens. The artwork depicts scenes of Cleveland's settlement and the evolution of transportation. Phase II. The second phase is projected to be at $120 million. The residential component of 140 apartments will anchor that next phase, which will be located closer to the river. Restaurants, shops, and nightclubs are included in the plans. West Bank of the Flats. A $33 million Greater Cleveland Aquarium opened on Jan 21, 2012, located at the FirstEnergy Powerhouse as the only freestanding aquarium in the state of Ohio. The aquarium takes up 70,000 square feet in the powerhouse's basement and contains over a million gallons of water in 42 tanks. The main feature of the aquarium is Marinescape’s Seatube®, an 145-foot-long clear tunnel, known as a Seatube The attraction was constructed around the building's architectural characteristics—including its smokestacks, columns and narrow hallways. Developers were not allowed to modify the structure or paint some walls because the old complex is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Greater Cleveland Aquarium was the first in the United States by New Zealand-based developer Marinescape NZ Ltd., who has built more than 20 aquariums in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Jacobs Pavilion at Nautica is a 5000-seat outdoor amphitheater. In 2012, it underwent in $1 million upgrade that included a new entrance constructed 200 feet north of the old one, creating space for an expanded riverfront plaza. Other upgrades included new brick pavement for the plaza and new fencing. In the fall of 2010, the Trust for Public Land and the Cleveland Rowing Foundation successfully purchased seven acres of commercial riverfront land for $3.2 million. The partnership is converting the vacant concrete-covered site into Rivergate Park, a new recreational center in the Flats. Officially opened in May 2011, the park preserves public access to the Cuyahoga River for access to activities including kayaking, canoeing, rowing and dragon boating. Long term plans include a canoe/kayak launch facility, concessions, and public restrooms. Cleveland Metroparks will replace the concrete and gravel on their land and replace it with grass, trees and other park amenities. Cleveland’s Crooked River Skate Park will be built on 15,000 square feet of city owned land. It is located along the river and adjacent to the Cleveland Metroparks new Rivergate Park.

The $54 million project opened Phase I in 2012, with Phase II opening in 2013. Cuyahoga County Headquarters and Ameritrust Complex. Relocation of the Cuyahoga County Administrative Headquarters, being developed by Geis Company, is spurring a $200 million mixed-use development at the corner of Euclid Avenue and East Ninth Street. The properties involved include the 29-story Ameritrust Tower, the attached 1010 Euclid Avenue building, the historic Cleveland Trust Company Rotunda, and the so-called “P and H” buildings, located on the Prospect Avenue side of the complex. Additionally, two parking garages on the south side of Prospect Ave along East Ninth Street will anchor the parking aspect. The P and H buildings will be razed and the site will become the home of a new, eight-story Cuyahoga County headquarters building, in which the county will lease for 26 years. Building size is expected to be 220,000 square feet. The plan calls for creating 210 high-end apartments in the former office tower and part of the building at 1010 Euclid, although portions of the building will be retained as office space in case the county needs to expand in the future. A proposed hotel on the lower floors of the 29-story tower is being considered. The Cleveland Trust Company Rotunda and 1010 Euclid Ave ground floor will house a full-service Heinen's grocery store set to open Fall 2014. Residential Conversions and New Construction.

wikipedia-2284945," Sunninghill Park  Sunninghill Park is a country house and estate of some , located north of Cheapside, in the civil parishes of Sunninghill and Ascot and Winkfield, adjoining the south-western boundary of Windsor Great Park in the English county of Berkshire. It was the official residence of the Duke of York from 1990 until 2004. First house. Sunninghill Park was originally part of Windsor Forest until 1630 when King Charles I granted it to Thomas Carey. In circa 1633, it was purchased by Sir Thomas Draper and sold in 1769 by his great grandson, Thomas Draper Baber, to Jeremiah Crutchley, whose family owned it until perhaps the death of Percy Edward Crutchley in 1940. The first significant house was built on the estate in the late Georgian period in the early 19th century, being a stucco building of two stories with later additions. It served as the headquarters of the American Ninth Air Force from November 1943 to September 1944. The Crown Estate Commissioners purchased the property in 1945, from the late Philip Hill. The main house was made available to Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and her future husband Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, for after their marriage in November 1947, but the house burned down on 30 August 1947 before they could occupy it, so they rented Windlesham Moor instead. In the mid-1960s the site was considered for a new home for Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, but this did not happen. Second house. In 1986 the walled garden of some was purchased from the Crown Estate Commissioners on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. The following year construction began on a two-storey red brick house to be the home of the Duke and Duchess of York. The architect responsible was Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, Balmoral Estate Architect and Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture at Heriot-Watt University. Construction was completed in 1990. The house has six reception rooms, 12 bedrooms, and 12 bathrooms, and compares in size to the larger country houses built since the Second World War. Sunninghill Park was the first newly-built royal home since Bagshot Park was built in 1879 for the Duke of Connaught. In the British tabloid press the home was often referred to as 'SouthYork' a play on words for the 'Southfork' estate on the popular 1980s soap opera ""Dallas"", and was also ""mocked for its resemblance to a Tesco-style supermarket"". Following the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, it was announced that the Duke of York planned to move out of Sunninghill Park and into Royal Lodge, Windsor, the Queen Mother's former residence. Until 2004, the Duke of York and his former wife shared the family’s home. In 2007, the Duchess rented Dolphin House, and became next door neighbours with her ex-husband. He moved in 2004, following refurbishment of Royal Lodge, funded by taking out a mortgage on Sunninghill Park. HM Land Registry records show that the house was sold for £15 million in 2007, £3 million over the asking price, to an offshore trust in the British Virgin Islands. Kenes Rakishev, a 29-year- old Kazakhstan businessman who calls himself a 'friend' of Prince Andrew, has admitted negotiating the deal with the help of his father-in-law Imangali Tasmagambetov, the mayor of Astana; but insists neither of them is the owner. The British press have speculated that the most likely owner is his business partner, Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. On 24 February 2009, the ""Daily Mail"" newspaper reported that the house has been allowed to fall into an increasingly derelict state. In July 2009, Bracknell Forest Borough Council were said to be considering seizing the property under the Housing Act 2004 and using it as a homeless shelter, following several reported break-ins. "
wikipedia-2284988," Gatcombe Park  Gatcombe Park is the private country home of H.R.H. The Princess Royal between the Gloucestershire villages of Minchinhampton and Avening in England, five miles (8 km) south of Stroud and around six miles (10 km) north of Highgrove House, the country residence of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales. History. The manors of Minchinhampton and Avening formed the basis of the later Gatcombe Park estate. After the Dissolution they were granted to Lord Windsor, whose family sold mostly undeveloped land by that date comprising them to Philip Sheppard in 1656. The core hillside land of the former estates, which was chiefly within the parish bounds of Gatcombe, was left in the will of Samuel Sheppard, who died in 1770, to his brother Edward. Accordingly a new manor house was built from 1771 to 1774 for Edward Sheppard, a local clothier, and altered for Ricardo to the designs of George Basevi (a relation), c. 1820. It features Bath stone construction, and comprises five main bedrooms, four secondary bedrooms, four reception rooms, a library, a billiard room and a conservatory, staff accommodation and its steep grounds are a separately listed parkland.  The house and farming estate were bought by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976 for Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips at the price of £5 million. The previous owner was Lord Butler of Saffron Walden, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a former Home Secretary, who had inherited the house from his father-in-law, Samuel Courtauld. Courtauld had acquired it from the Ricardo family, owners from 1814 (when the estate was bought by the political economist and MP David Ricardo who had made his fortune on the stock exchange) to 1940. The Crown paid for its renovation and redecoration for Princess Anne and Captain Phillips, who moved into it in November 1977. In 1978 the owners' land was increased by the purchase of Aston Farm to the east. The Estates thus while the first marriage subsisted covered approximately , of which the bulk of its of woodland appertains to Gatcombe Park itself and includes a lake containing brown trout. The two sides of these estates had considerable stabling facilities, including a new stable block and Aston Farm owns the underlying land of an airstrip. Today the Princess Royal lives in the manor house with her second husband, Sir Timothy Laurence. Previously, her first husband Mark Phillips lived in the adjoining Aston Farm with his second wife, the estates having been separated when the couple divorced; Mr. Phillips later moved to America. Son Peter Phillips and daughter Zara Phillips had their own personal cottages within the estate until their engagements. Peter and his wife Autumn resided in London. Zara and her husband, Mike Tindall, lived in nearby Cheltenham after their 2011 marriage, but in January 2013 it was reported that the couple were moving to live on the Princess Royal's estate.  The grounds are well known for hosting the Festival of British Eventing over the first weekend of August. Organised by Mark Phillips with considerable input from Anne, the event attracts the world's top Olympians and over 40,000 paying spectators, as well as BBC television coverage. The estate also holds two smaller horse trials, in the spring and autumn, whose courses are designed by Anne, and a biannual craft fair with around 160 exhibitors is run, in May and October. "
wikipedia-2285007," Regenerative medicine  Regenerative medicine is the ""process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function"". This field holds the promise of regenerating damaged tissues and organs in the body by replacing damaged tissue and/or by stimulating the body's own repair mechanisms to heal previously irreparable tissues or organs. Regenerative medicine also empowers scientists to grow tissues and organs in the laboratory and safely implant them when the body cannot heal itself. Importantly, regenerative medicine has the potential to solve the problem of the shortage of organs available for donation compared to the number of patients that require life-saving organ transplantation. Depending on the source of cells, it can potentially solve the problem of organ transplant rejection if the organ's cells are derived from the patient's own tissue or cells. Widely attributed to having first been coined by William Haseltine (founder of Human Genome Sciences), the term ""Regenerative Medicine"" was first found in a 1992 article on hospital administration by Leland Kaiser. Kaiser’s paper closes with a series of short paragraphs on future technologies that will impact hospitals. One such paragraph had ‘‘Regenerative Medicine’’ as a bold print title and went on to state, ‘‘A new branch of medicine will develop that attempts to change the course of chronic disease and in many instances will regenerate tired and failing organ systems.’’"" Regenerative Medicine refers to a group of biomedical approaches to clinical therapies that may involve the use of stem cells. Examples include the injection of stem cells or progenitor cells (cell therapies); the induction of regeneration by biologically active molecules administered alone or as a secretion by infused cells (immunomodulation therapy); and transplantation of ""in vitro"" grown organs and tissues (Tissue engineering). A form of regenerative medicine that recently made it into clinical practice, is the use of heparan sulfate analogues on (chronic) wound healing. Heparan sulfate analogues replace degraded heparan sulfate at the wound site. They assist the damaged tissue to heal itself by repositioning growth factors and cytokines back into the damaged extracellular matrix. For example, in abdominal wall reconstruction (like inguinal hernia repair), biologic meshes are being used with some success. Pioneers. At the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, in North Carolina, Dr. Anthony Atala and his colleagues have successfully extracted muscle and bladder cells from several patients' bodies, cultivated these cells in petri dishes, and then layered the cells in three-dimensional molds that resembled the shapes of the bladders. Within weeks, the cells in the molds began functioning as regular bladders which were then implanted back into the patients' bodies. The team is currently working on re-growing over 22 other different organs including the liver, heart, kidneys and testicles. From 1995 to 1998 Michael D. West, PhD, organized and managed the research between Geron Corporation and its academic collaborators James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University that led to the first isolation of human embryonic stem and human embryonic germ cells. Dr. Stephen Badylak, a Research Professor in the Department of Surgery and director of Tissue Engineering at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, has developed a process which involves scraping cells from the lining of a pig's bladder, decellularizing (removing cells to leave a clean extracellular structure) the tissue and then drying it to become a sheet or a powder. This cellular matrix powder was used to regrow the finger of Lee Spievak, who had severed half an inch of his finger after getting it caught in a propeller of a model plane. As of 2011, this new technology is being employed by the military to U.S. war veterans in Texas, as well as to some civilian patients. Nicknamed ""pixie-dust,"" the powdered extracellular matrix is being used with great success to regenerate tissue lost and damaged due to traumatic injuries. For example, a 19-year old male patient who lost a significant amount of tissue on his heel after a fall from a cliff received two applications of the extracellular matrix powder at Kaiser Hospital in Roseville, California. His heel successfully regenerated, avoiding the necessity of bone and skin grafts, as well as other reconstructive surgery.  In June 2008, at the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team, of the University of Barcelona, performed the first tissue engineered trachea (wind pipe) transplantation. Adult stem cells were extracted from the patient's bone marrow, grown into a large population, and matured into cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, using an adaptive method originally devised for treating osteoarthritis. The team then seeded the newly grown chondrocytes, as well as epithileal cells, into a decellularised (free of donor cells) tracheal segment that was donated from a 51 year old transplant donor who had died of cerebral hemorrhage. After four days of seeding, the graft was used to replace the patient's left main bronchus. After one month, a biopsy elicited local bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back successfully. In 2009 the SENS Foundation was launched, with its stated aim as ""the application of regenerative medicine – defined to include the repair of living cells and extracellular material in situ – to the diseases and disabilities of ageing.""  In 2012, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team improved upon the 2008 implant by transplanting a laboratory-made trachea seeded with the patient's own cells. Cord Blood and Regenerative Medicine. Because a person’s own (autologous) cord blood stem cells can be safely infused back into that individual without being rejected by the body’s immune system — and because they have unique characteristics compared to other sources of stem cells — they are an increasing focus of regenerative medicine research. The use of cord blood stem cells in treating conditions such as brain injury and Type 1 Diabetes is already being studied in humans, and earlier stage research is being conducted for treatments of stroke, and hearing loss. Current estimates indicate that approximately 1 in 3 Americans could benefit from regenerative medicine. With autologous (the person’s own) cells, there is no risk of the immune system rejecting the cells, so physicians and researchers are only performing these potential cord blood therapies on children who have their own stem cells available. Researchers are exploring the use of cord blood stem cells in the following regenerative medicine applications: Type 1 Diabetes. A clinical trial under way at the University of Florida is examining how an infusion of autologous cord blood stem cells into children with Type 1 diabetes will impact metabolic control over time, as compared to standard insulin treatments. Preliminary results demonstrate that an infusion of cord blood stem cell is safe and may provide some slowing of the loss of insulin production in children with type 1 diabetes. Cardiovascular. The stem cells found in a newborn’s umbilical cord blood are holding great promise in cardiovascular repair. Researchers are noting several positive observations in pre-clinical animal studies. Thus far, in animal models of myocardial infarction, cord blood stem cells have shown the ability to selectively migrate to injured cardiac tissue, improve vascular function and blood flow at the site of injury, and improve overall heart function. Central Nervous System. Research has demonstrated convincing evidence in animal models that cord blood stem cells injected intravenously have the ability to migrate to the area of brain injury, alleviating mobility related symptoms. Also, administration of human cord blood stem cells into animals with stroke was shown to significantly improve behavior by stimulating the creation of new blood vessels and neurons in the brain. This research also lends support for the pioneering clinical work at Duke University, focused on evaluating the impact of autologous cord blood infusions in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy and other forms of brain injury. This study is examining if an infusion of the child’s own cord blood stem cells facilitates repair of damaged brain tissue, including many with cerebral palsy. To date, more than 100 children have participated in the experimental treatment – many whose parents are reporting good progress. Another report published encouraging results in 2 toddlers with cerebral palsy where autologous cord blood infusion was combined with G-CSF. As these clinical and pre-clinical studies demonstrate, cord blood stem cells will likely be an important resource as medicine advances toward harnessing the body’s own cells for treatment. The field of regenerative medicine can be expected to benefit greatly as additional cord blood stem cell applications are researched and more people have access to their own preserved cord blood. On May 17, 2012, Osiris Therapeutics announced that Canadian health regulators approved Prochymal, a drug for acute graft-versus-host disease in children who have failed to respond to steroid treatment. Prochymal is the first stem cell drug to be approved anywhere in the world for a systemic disease. Graft-versus-host disease, a potentially fatal complication from bone marrow transplant, involves the newly implanted cells attacking the patient’s body. Heparan Sulfate Analogues. Heparan sulfates glycosylaminoglycans bind to the heparan sulfate binding domain of matrix proteins such as collagens and fibronectin on the extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate consist of a chain of subunits of 85kD which is negatively charged and can therefore interact with the slightly positively charged basic amino acids of growth factors and cytokines, protecting and holding them in the process. In any wound area heparan sulfates are degraded by glycanases and heparanases. This disrupts the normal tissue homeostasis because the different growth factors and cytokines cannot be held and protected by the heparan sulfate.  Heparan sulfate analogue is a synthetic heparan sulfate mimetic. Due to a different coupling of subunits it is resistant to enzymatic degradation: the β2-4 carbon-carbon binding of the subunits of heperan sulfate is prone to enzymatic cleavage whereas the α1-6 carbon-carbon binding of the subunits of heparan sulfate analogues are resistant to cleavage by all known glycanases and heparanases . Heparan sulfate analogues have shown significant improvement on different kind of wounds in pre-clinical research. Animal research has shown that heparan sulfate analogues help the wounds heal but retain the normal tissue structure and prevent scarring. External links.

wikipedia-2285013," Cell therapy  Cell therapy (or Cellular therapy) is therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient. Cell therapy originated in the nineteenth century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness. Although such attempts produced no positive benefit, further research found in the mid twentieth century that human cells could be used to help prevent the human body rejecting transplanted organs, leading in time to successful bone marrow transplantation. Today two distinct categories of cell therapy are recognized. The first category is cell therapy in mainstream medicine. This is the subject of intense research and the basis of potential therapeutic benefit. Such research, especially when it involves human embryonic material, is controversial. The second category is in alternative medicine, and perpetuates the practice of injecting animal materials in an attempt to cure disease. This practice, according to the American Cancer Society, is not backed by any medical evidence of effectiveness, and can have deadly consequences. Background. Cell therapy can be defined as therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient. There are two branches of cell therapy: one is legitimate and established, whereby human cells are transplanted from a donor to a patient; the other is dangerous alternative medicine, whereby injected animal cells are used to attempt to treat illness. The origins of cell therapy can perhaps be traced to the nineteenth century, when Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817–1894) injected animal testicle extracts in an attempt to stop the effects of aging. In 1931 Paul Niehans (1882–1971) – who has been called the inventor of cell therapy – attempted to cure a patient by injecting material from calf embryos. Niehans claimed to have treated many people for cancer using this technique, though his claims have never been validated by research. In 1953 researchers found that laboratory animals could be helped not to reject organ transplants by pre-innoculating them with cells from donor animals; in 1968, in Minnesota, the first successful successful human bone marrow took place. Bone marrow transplants have been found to be effective, along with some other kinds of human cell therapy – for example in treating damaged knee cartilage. In recent times, cell therapy using human material has been recognized as an important field in the treatment of human disease. The experimental field of Stem cell therapy has shown promise for new types of treatment. In mainstream medicine, cell therapy is supported by a distinct healthcare industry which sees strong prospects for future growth. In mainstream medicine. Allogeneic Cell Therapy. In allogeneic cell therapy the donor is a different person to the recipient of the cells. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the allogenic methodology is promising because unmatched allogenic therapies can form the basis of ""off the shelf"" products. There is research interest in attempting to develop such products to treat conditions including Crohn's disease and a variety of vascular conditions. Human embryonic stem cells. Research into human embryonic stem cells is controversial, and regulation varies from country to country, with some countries banning it outright. Nevertheless, these cells are being investigated as the basis for a number of therapeutic applications, including possible treatments for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Mechanisms of Action. Cell therapy is targeted at many clinical indications in multiple organs and by several modes of cell delivery. Accordingly, the specific mechanisms of action involved in the therapies are wide ranging. However, there are two main principles by which cells facilitate therapeutic action: Neural Stem Cell Therapy. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the subject of ongoing research for possible therapeutic applications, for example for treating a number of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy. MSCs are immunomodulatory, multipotent and fast proliferating and these unique capabilities mean they can be used for a wide range of treatments including immune-modulatory therapy, bone and cartilage regeneration, myocardium regeneration and the treatment of Hurler syndrome, a skeletal and neurological disorder. Researchers have demonstrated the use of MSCs for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Horwitz et al. transplanted bone marrow (BM) cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings to patients suffering from OI. Results show that MSCs can develop into normal osteoblasts, leading to fast bone development and reduced fracture frequencies. A more recent clinical trial showed that allogeneic fetal MSCs transplanted in utero in patients with severe OI can engraft and differentiate into bone in a human fetus.  Besides bone and cartilage regeneration, cardiomyocyte regeneration with autologous BM MSCs has also been reported recently. Introduction of BM MSCs following myocardial infarction (MI) resulted in significant reduction of damaged regions and improvement in heart function. Clinical trials for treatment of acute MI with Prochymal by Osiris Therapeutics are underway. Also, a clinical trial revealed huge improvements in nerve conduction velocities in Hurler’s Syndrome patients infused with BM MSCs from HLA-identical siblings. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCs possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all types of blood cells, especially those involved in the human immune system. Thus, they can be used to treat blood and immune disorders. Since human bone marrow (BM) grafting was first published in 1957, there have been significant advancements in HSCs therapy. Following that, syngeneic marrow infusion and allogeneic marrow grafting were performed successfully. HSCs therapy can also render its cure by reconstituting damaged blood-forming cells and restoring the immune system after high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate disease. There are three types of HSCT: syngeneic, autologous, and allogeneic transplants. Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins. Autologous transplantations use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence do not cause any complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic transplantations involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and GVHD, allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant). Mismatch of HLA loci would result in treatment-related mortality and higher risk of acute GVHD.  In addition to BM derived HSCs, the use of alternative sources such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) has been increasing. In comparison with BM derived HSCs recipients, PBSCs recipients afflicted with myeloid malignancies reported a faster engraftment and better overall survival. However, this was at the expense of increased rate of GVHD. Also, the use of UCB requires less stringent HLA loci matching, although the time of engraftment is longer and graft failure rate is higher. In alternative medicine. In alternative medicine, cell therapy is defined as the injection of non-human cellular animal material in an attempt to treat illness. Quackwatch labels this as ""senseless"", since ""cells from the organs of one species cannot replace the cells from the organs of other species"" and because a number of serious adverse effects have been reported. Of this alternative, animal-based form of cell therapy, the American Cancer Society say: ""Available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. In may in fact be lethal ..."". "
wikipedia-2285019," Gaussian frequency-shift keying  Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) is a type of Frequency Shift Keying modulation that uses a Gaussian filter to smooth positive/negative frequency deviations, which represent a binary 1 or 0. It is used by DECT, Bluetooth, Cypress WirelessUSB, Nordic Semiconductor, Texas Instruments LPRF, z-wave and Wavenis devices. For basic data rate Bluetooth the minimum deviation is 115 kHz. Generalization. A GFSK modulator, is similar to a FSK modulator, except that before the baseband pulses (−1, +1) go into the FSK modulator, it is passed through a gaussian filter to make the pulse smoother so to limit its spectral width. Gaussian filtering is one of the very standard ways for reducing the spectral width, it is called ""pulse shaping"". If we use −1 for formula_1 and +1 for formula_2, once when we jump from −1 to +1 or +1 to −1, the modulated waveform changes rapidly, which introduces large out-of-band spectrum. If we change the pulse going from −1 to +1 as −1, −.98, −.93 ... +.96, +.99, +1, and we use this smoother pulse to modulate the carrier, the out-of-band spectrum will be reduced. "
wikipedia-2285051," Sancocho  Sancocho (from the Spanish verb ""sancochar"", ""to parboil"") is a traditional soup (often considered a stew) in several Latin American cuisines derived from the Spanish dish known as Cocido. Variations represent popular national dishes in the Honduras, Canary Islands, Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. It usually consists of large pieces of meat and vegetables served in a broth. There are similar dishes in other countries, such as Bouillon in Haiti. Variations. ""Sancocho"" in Latin America, especially the Caribbean, evolved from both Puchero Canario and Sancocho of the Canary Islands, which were brought with ""Canarios"" -- Canary Islanders who emigrated to Latin America. - Reflecting Spanish-influence, Sancocho is eaten in the Philippines where the hearty stew is made with beef shanks, chicken, pork butt, bacon, chorizo de bilbao and morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) as well as potatoes, cabbage, bok choy, carrots and string beans. Known as cocido in the Philippines it is often confused with puchero Filipino, which may use ham and different sausages. "
wikipedia-2285059," Independiente Santa Fe  Independiente Santa Fe, known simply as Santa Fe, is a professional Colombian football team based in Bogotá, that currently plays in the Categoría Primera A. They play their home games at the El Campín stadium. Considered one of the most important and historic teams in Colombia, Santa Fe has won 7 national championships (most recently in 2012), won the first Colombian national championship in 1948, and is one of the three teams that has played every championship in the Categoría Primera A, the top league in Colombia. History. ""Independiente Santa Fe"" was officially founded on February 28, 1941, after several alumni of the Gimnasio Moderno decided to create a serious football team to compete against other amateur teams in the city. The original founders of the team were: Gonzalo Rueda Caro, Luis Robledo, Ernesto Gamboa, Luis Carlos Reyes, Guillermo Escobar, Tulio Gutiérrez, Roberto Haim, Eduardo Lleras, Alfonso Martín, Álvaro Martín, Eusebio de Mendoza, Julián Mendoza, Hernán Mora, Cesar Payan, Rafael Urdaneta y Pablo Valenzuela. Gonzalo Rueda Caro, also founder of the radio station HJCK, was the first president of the club. The first championship in which the team joined went to the A.D.B. (Asociación Deportiva de Bogotá) tournament. The team was placed in the second category of the tournament, and played his first match against the ""Legión Militar de los Taxis Rojos"", match that ended in a 3-3 draw. The team finished the tournament as runners-up of the second category. In 1942, Santa Fe was coached by Jack Greenwell, former FC Barcelona player and coach, notable for having won 3 times the Copa del Rey and the 1939 South American Championship with Peru. That year Santa Fe played in the first division of the A.D.B., which was canceled in the middle of that year. That same year also reached the final of the ""Torneo de Cundinamarca"", which lost against América de Cali. Jack Greenwell died on November 20 of that year. On 21 May 1948 was established in Colombia the DIMAYOR, which would serve to manage Colombian professional football. They agreed to hold the first professional championship for the second half of the year. On August 15, Santa Fe played its first game in the professional championship against Deportes Caldas, match that ended 3-3. Santa Fe finished the league as the first champion of the Colombian first division, winning 12 of 18 games, drew 3 and lost also 3. The team was able to score 57 goals for, and received 29 against. The goalscorer of the team was the Spanish Argentine Jesús María Lires with 20 goals, second goalscorer of the tournament. Colours and badge. The first badge of Santa Fe was designed by Ernesto Gamboa and Gonzalo Rueda with a clear British influence. Highlighting the Bogota flag colors, red and yellow, combined to form the Holy Cross, symbol of faith and respect, referring to the name of the club. There are many versions about the origin of the colours of the uniform. The most commonly accepted version is that one of the founders of the Independiente Santa Fe was a fan of Arsenal F.C., ​​thus gives the team the red and white, which from 1941 became symbol of the club. Although historically the uniform of Santa Fe has been red and white, the club has used other colors in its uniform, always in special cases. For example, the team used a yellow uniform to celebrate the 468th anniversary of Bogotá, in a match in which Santa Fe defeated Atlético Nacional by a score of 4-0, on 6 August 2006. Another special uniform worn by Santa Fe was used on 7 August 2008 in the duel in which it faced Real Madrid at the Estadio El Campín, on the occasion of the celebration of the 470 years of the foundation of Bogotá. Stadium. The stadium Nemesio Camacho, also known as El Campín, located in Bogotá, is the venue where Independiente Santa Fe plays their home games. Its capacity is 36,343. Santa Fe's supporters traditionally tend to sit in the southernmost half of the stadium. El Campín was inaugurated on August 10, 1938 at 57th Street with 30, having started its construction in 1935 on the initiative of the mayor of Bogotá, Jorge Eliecer Gaitán. The structure was handled by the German engineer Frederick Leder Müller. The stadium was designed to hold 10,000 spectators. The opening match was held in the 1938 Bolivarian Games, facing the Colombia national football team and the Ecuador national football team, with a 2-1 defeat for the local team. In 1951, the year that Santa Fe begins to use it to its home games, the stadium expanded its capacity to 39,000 spectators. The second extension of El Campín occurred in 1952 with a dramatic transformation. The total capacity changed to 62,500 spectators, but was limited to 48,000 for security. The last major modification was made for the qualifiers matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Other grounds that have been used by Independiente Santa Fe for their home games have been: the Estadio Alfonso López Pumarejo, its first ground, the Estadio Municipal Los Zipas and the Estadio Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento. Supporters and rivalries. In the late 90's, the most notorious Barra brava of Santa Fe, ""La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur"" (White-Red South Guard) was created. It was one of the first fan-led organizations in Colombia that was fully formalized. In 2005, La Guardia Albirroja Sur made one of the largest soccer team's flag in the world. The flag, named the ""Lienzo de Fe"" was 350 meters long and 38 meters high, covering the southern end of the Estadio El Campín, the half of the stadium, where the team's fans locate in home games. Rivalries. Since the appearance of professional football in Colombia, Santa Fe and Millonarios were recognized as the two biggest clubs in Bogotá. Because of this, Santa Fe holds a rivalry with this club, and the match between these two is called ""El Clásico Capitalino"" (The Capital derby). The first edition of the classic was held in 1942 with a defeat by 4:1. However, the first official classic was played on September 19, 1948 with victory for Santa Fe by 5:3. Players. Records. Top 10 most appearances of all time. Last updated on: 31 June 2013 Top 10 scorers of all time. Last updated on: 31 June 2013 Honours. As of 28 June 2013, Santa Fe have won 7 Primera A titles and 2 Copa Colombia trophies. "
wikipedia-2285079," Warren Haynes  Warren Haynes (born April 6, 1960) is an American rock and blues guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. Haynes is best known for his work as longtime guitarist with The Allman Brothers Band and as founding member of the jam band Gov't Mule. Early in his career he was a guitarist for David Allan Coe and The Dickey Betts Band. Haynes also is known for his associations with the remaining members of The Grateful Dead, including touring with Phil Lesh and Friends and The Dead. In addition, Haynes founded and manages Evil Teen Records. Personal background and style. In addition to singing and playing acoustic and electric guitar, Haynes is also a songwriter. He spent his formative years in Asheville, North Carolina, where he was born, and lived with his two older brothers and his father, Edward Haynes. Warren began to play the guitar at age 12. His primary guitar is a Gibson Les Paul '58 Reissue Electric Guitar. His choice of a '58 is most likely because of Duane Allman's famed '58 Les Paul and the tone he achieved with that, rather than the more commonly used '59 Les Paul model, popularized by guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page).  Haynes has referred to himself as a ""Gibson man"", often playing Gibson Firebird and Gibson ES-335 models as well as the Les Paul models. This was acknowledged by the American guitar maker Gibson Guitar Corp. which has included a limited edition ""Warren Haynes signature Les Paul"" in its product line. Built according to Haynes' specifications and modeled on his '58 Les Paul. Haynes is married to Stefani Scamardo, a DJ for Sirius radio and the long-time manager of Gov't Mule. Influences. In a 2006 interview with Gibson.com's ""Backstage Pass"" Haynes explains his early influences: ""When I first started—chronologically speaking—Hendrix and Clapton and Johnny Winter were the first three people I got turned on to. That was the Cream era of Clapton. Then eventually, I heard the Allman Brothers and everybody else from that era that I stole something from (laughs). Of course, I would read interviews with all these people and find out who they listened to. And they all listened to B.B. King and Freddie King and Albert King and Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and Elmore James, so I would go back and discover that stuff."" During the same 2006 interview Haynes talked about his realization of how much the blues had influenced his one-time employer, David Allen Coe. ""When I joined Coe’s band, I realized how much he loved blues. Whenever his voice was tired on tour, we would go out just the two of us and open up with a bunch of Jimmy Reed songs. Then segue that into the show. One by one, the drummer would walk on and the bass player would walk on, and eventually the whole band would be onstage. He was really influenced by Jimmy Reed and Lightnin’ Hopkins. That stuff was way back in his formative years, so whenever it came out, it was very genuine.""  Professional career. The early years and David Allan Coe. Warren Haynes joined David Allan Coe's touring and recording band in 1980 when he was 20 years old. He remained with Coe's band for four years. After Coe, Haynes got a gig with The Nighthawks, while continuing to play with local musicians and doing session guitar and vocal work. One notable achievement of this period is a song he co-wrote with Dennis Robbins and Bobby Boyd for the famed country-rock musician Garth Brooks, titled ""Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House"", which was released on the album ""No Fences"" and remained the number 1 single on ""Billboard""'s Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for twenty weeks. Dickey Betts Band and The Allman Brothers Band. Around 1987, Haynes got a call to perform back up vocals on a studio album by Dickey Betts, along with Dennis Robbins. Betts, who had concentrated on his solo career following the break-up of The Allman Brothers Band, decided to add Haynes to his band as his guitarist after the session. With Matt Abts on drums and Johnny Neel on keyboards the now formed Dickey Betts Band released the 1988 album ""Pattern Disruptive"". In the same year, Haynes also co-wrote the title track for Gregg Allman's solo album ""Just Before the Bullets Fly."" In 1989, The Allman Brothers Band decided to reunite, and Betts recruited Haynes to join the band. Also joining were Johnny Neel on keyboards and Allen Woody on bass guitar. Haynes has since played on four well-received studio albums, including the gold certified ""Where It All Begins"" (1994). He also has played on four official live releases from the band, including the 2003 DVD ""Live at the Beacon Theatre"". Haynes and Woody left the group in March 1997 to focus solely on their side project Gov't Mule. Shortly after Woody's untimely death on August 26, 2000, Haynes began appearing with The Allman Brothers Band again in 2000 alongside young guitar prodigy Derek Trucks. He returned to the band as a full-time member a few months later and has remained active every year with the Allman Brothers since. Gov't Mule. In 1994, Haynes formed Gov't Mule with Abts and Woody. Haynes and Woody initially split time between Gov't Mule and The Allman Brothers Band, but after The Allman Brothers' last show of their 1997 run at New York's Beacon Theatre on March 26, 1997, both left the band to focus on Gov't Mule full-time. They released three albums and became known for their powerful live performances. Some of these performances have been released as official live albums (""Live At Roseland Ballroom"", ""Live With A Little Help From Our Friends"" and ""Mulennium"" – the latter two capture their annual New Year's Eve shows). In August 2000 Woody died, and a decision was made to finish the tour acoustically as the ""Smile at Half-Mast"" tour. Gov't Mule released two studio albums (""The Deep End, Volume 1"" and ""The Deep End, Volume 2"") and a live album/DVD (""The Deepest End, Live in Concert"") featuring many of Woody's favorite bass players. In 2003 Andy Hess (bass) and Danny Louis (keyboard/organ) were added as permanent members to the group and in late 2004 they released their first studio effort, ""Deja Voodoo"", which later included an EP of newly recorded material titled ""Mo Voodoo"". After recording 2006's ""High & Mighty"", Gov't Mule also released a dub EP titled ""Mighty High"" and a DVD titled ""Tail of 2 Cities"" that contained two full performances recorded in 2004 and 2006. The two shows on the DVD captured the first show of the Deja Voodoo Tour and the last show of the High & Mighty Tour, serving to encapsulate what was created over those two years. In 2008, Andy Hess left Gov't Mule to pursue other projects and was replaced by relative unknown Jorgen Carlsson. ""By a Thread"", the first studio album from Gov't Mule with Jorgen, was released in 2009 on Haynes' own label, Evil Teen Records. In 2010 they went back to the vault and released Mulennium a 3 disc recording of a show from New Year's Eve 1999 in Atlanta. This was the first official recording released of the original trio since the death of Allen Woody in 2000. It also featured an appearance by Little Milton, one of Haynes's guitar heroes from his youth. The Dead. Since the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, Warren has performed and toured with many of the remaining members of the Grateful Dead. In 1997 Haynes and Abts came onstage to jam with Bob Weir and Rob Wasserman in a small club that was being filmed for Robert Mugge's film on Robert Johnson, ""Hellhound On My Trail."" Then in 1999 Phil Lesh approached him to play lead guitar and sing for his solo group Phil Lesh & Friends, where he played for 3 years. In 2004 when The Dead (remaining members of the Grateful Dead) were in need of a new guitarist they called upon Haynes to come play lead and sing for that summer's ""Wave That Flag Tour"". His run with The Dead ended on a night where he came in with them, then performed a solo acoustic set, and then ended the night playing with The Allman Brothers Band and started out on his next tour with them. He played lead guitar for The Dead again in late 2008 when they performed at a benefit at Penn State for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama and then toured with them in the Spring of 2009. Solo artist and guest appearances. In 1993, Haynes released his first solo album, ""Tales of Ordinary Madness"", which was produced by former Allman Brother keyboardist Chuck Leavell. He toured briefly in support of the record with various musicians. In 2003 and 2004, Haynes released two solo acoustic albums, ""The Lone EP"", a collection of live performances and ""Live From Bonnaroo"" which documents his solo performance at the 2003 Bonnaroo Music Festival. When not touring with one of his electric bands, Haynes will often take time out to do solo acoustic shows which include a variety of well-known and rare covers along with his own material. In 2004, Warren Haynes performed five full-length solo acoustic shows, as well as opened 23 times for The Dead and once for The Allman Brothers Band. He has also made 45 song appearances and 28 concert appearances with Dave Matthews Band, including on two released live albums: ""Live at Central Park Concert"" in which he performed ""Cortez the Killer"", and ""Jimi Thing"", and ""Live at Piedmont Park"" where he performed ""What Would You Say"". In 2005 Haynes performed a one time only show under the name Warren Haynes & Friends. The band included Abts on drums, Dave Schools of Widespread Panic on bass, John Medeski of Medeski Martin & Wood, and Skerik the avant-garde sax player of bands such as Critters Buggin' and Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. The group played a selection of blues songs, including songs of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Tom Waits, and Gov't Mule standards. The band was also featured as the house band during a number of tapings of Last Call with Carson Daly in early February 2005. During one of these tapings, the scheduled musical act was absent, so Haynes performed an acoustic rendition of U2's ""One"". The song also appeared on his ""Live from Bonnaroo"" album. Haynes covered the Bob Dylan song ""I Shall Be Released"" with the band Coheed and Cambria in 2008 as a part of an encore performance the band played during their Neverender shows.  After recording Gov't Mule's ""By a Thread"" album, Haynes formed The Warren Haynes Band. The group included George Porter Jr. on bass, Ivan Neville on keys and Raymond Weber on drums. Also joining them on keys was Ian McLagan, as well as vocalist Ruthie Foster and Ron Holloway on tenor sax. The Warren Haynes Band made their debut performance at Haynes' annual Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina on December 11, 2010. The album ""Man in Motion"" was released in May 2011 and debuted in the Billboard Top 20. An extensive tour occurred after the release through the rest of 2011; the touring version of the band included Holloway, drummer Terence Higgins of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, bassist Ron Johnson, keyboardist Nigel Hall, and various vocalists, either Foster, Alfreda Gerald, or Alecia Chakour. The Warren Haynes Band ""Live at The Moody Theater"" 2CD/1DVD package came out in April 2012 on Stax Records with the lineup of Warren Haynes (Vocals & Guitar), Ron Holloway (Sax), Ron Johnson (Bass), Terence Higgins (Drums), Nigel Hall (Keys) & Alecia Chakour (Vocals).  Haynes has stated that his further solo efforts might take him into still other fields. ""There are other projects I want to do, too,"" he relates. ""I'm interested in recording a singer-songwriter oriented album with more acoustic instruments, a jazzy instrumental CD and a straight-up blues record. But like Man In Motion, those albums will have to wait until the time is right.""  The Christmas Jam. Starting in 1989, Haynes put together an annual charity benefit show, inviting musicians originally from his home town of Asheville who were home for Christmas, the only time of year they would all be in town at the same time. The first show, held at the ""45 Cherry"" club in Asheville on December 29, 1989, was dubbed ""The Christmas Jam: Musician's X-Mas Reunion."" Some of the artists at the first Christmas Jam were Warren Haynes, Mike Barnes, Crystal Zoo, The Stripp Band and the McBad Brothers Band.  In the initial years the proceeds from the concert were donated to various charities but eventually the organizers decided to focus on Habitat for Humanity, a charity that builds houses for the disadvantaged. In tribute to his financial support of Habitat for Humanity, a subdivision in Lower Hominy, North Carolina, a suburb of Asheville, North Carolina has a street named after Warren Haynes. In 2002, Haynes was presented the Key to the City of Asheville by Mayor Charles Worley. In 2003, Mayor Worley proclaimed December 18 ""Warren Haynes Day.""  The event has continued to grow every year and is now dubbed ""Warren Haynes Presents: The Christmas Jam."" Due to increasing audience demand the show was eventually moved to the Asheville Civic Center, and was now featuring many well known artists and friends Haynes played with over the years.  Some past performers include The Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler, Jackson Browne, Johnny Winter, Drive-By Truckers, DJ Logic, Peter Frampton, Gov't Mule, John Hiatt, Bruce Hornsby, Hot Tuna, John Paul Jones (musician), Ray LaMontagne, Phil Lesh & Friends, Umphrey's McGee, Little Feat, Living Colour, Branford Marsalis, Dave Matthews, Neville Brothers, New Orleans Social Club, North Mississippi Allstars, Phish's Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon, Grace Potter & The Nocturnals, Robert Randolph & The Family Band, John Scofield, Dr.Ralph Stanley, Marty Stuart, Taj Mahal Trio, Susan Tedeschi, The Derek Trucks Band,Bob Weir, Widespread Panic's John Bell, Dave Schools, John (Jo Jo) Herman, Todd Nance & Jimmy Herring, Kevn Kinney from Drivin' N Cryin', and Edwin McCain.  In 2008, for its twentieth anniversary, ""The Christmas Jam"" consisted of two nights of music; including ""The Christmas Jam By Day,"" a series of events including daytime concerts, movie screenings, and art, photo, and poster exhibits taking place in downtown Asheville on the days leading up to the show. The event reverted to one night in 2009 but retained the ""The Christmas Jam By Day,"" and included the new ""Christmas Comedy Jam."" The same format was repeated in 2010. Instructional Videos. Haynes has recorded two instructional videos; ""Electric Blues & Slide Guitar"" and ""Acoustic Slide and the art of Electric Improvisation"". He discusses his influences and shows an array of techniques such as ""call and response"", string bending, vibrato, slide guitar in standard tuning and some acoustic open tuning licks in G and E tunings. For the demonstrations of the Electric Improvisation section of the second video he is accompanied by Allen Woody and Matt Abts. Taping policy. All of Warren Haynes' projects allow audio taping and trading. He does not approve of video recording or photography of his performances and does not provide access to soundboard patches. The Allman Brothers Band also allows taping and trading, but does not allow distribution of their shows via the internet via applications such as BitTorrent. The reason given for this restriction is that it is more communal to trade person-to-person. In a 2005 ""USA Today"" article, Haynes stated that while tape-trading may cut into band profits, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks due to an increased fanbase. "

wikipedia-2285130," Walloon Lake  Walloon Lake is a glacier-formed lake and the headwater for the Bear River located in Charlevoix and Emmet counties in Northern Michigan. It is now home to many vacation homes and cottages.  Though the end of the West arm of the lake is less than 1 mile from Lake Michigan, Walloon Lake's surface elevation is over 100' higher. The Bear River drains from the East end of the lake in Walloon Lake village, winding down to its outflow into Lake Michigan on the south end of Petoskey. History. Walloon Lake was originally named Talcott. As the story goes, a local butcher, J. R. Haas, saw the name Walloon Lake on an old railroad map, he tried to discover the history behind the name. It is thought that a group of Walloons from Belgium settled the land at the north end of the lake, which was then called Bear Lake. No trace of this settlement has ever been found.  Ecology. The lake has 30 miles of shoreline and is an irregular shape vaguely resembling a human form. Hence, locals refer to their cottages on the ""west arm"", or the ""foot"", etc. The lake covers and is primarily fed from groundwater. Its deepest point is just over deep. Recently, the introduction of zebra mussels has made the clear waters even clearer. For a few months after the ice melts (usually in April), it is possible to see to the bottom of the lake at depths up to thirty feet.  Current Use. Real-estate value has increased rapidly since the 1970s, and many large houses have been built around the lake. There are two camps on the lake: Camp Daggett and Camp Michigania, the University of Michigan's Alumni Association camp. Transportation. Indian Trails provides daily intercity bus service between St. Ignace and East Lansing, Michigan. Historic Sites. Windemere. Located on the North Shore of Walloon Lake, Windemere was the childhood summer home of Ernest Hemingway. The house is still owned by the Hemingway family. The Walloon Lake Inn. Originally named Fern Cottage, the inn was a destination point for many visitors and also served as a docking point for the steamboats that would take the travelers to hotels or to their cottages on the lake. The inn has been renovated over the last thirty years and now serves the community as a bed and breakfast. The inn also houses a French-style restaurant and a culinary school.  Panorama. Notable Residents: The childhood cottage of Ernest Hemingway is located on Walloon Lake. Today, it is home to one of Hemingway's nephews. "

wikipedia-2291147," Glen Plake  Glen Plake (born 9 September 1964) is an American Freestyle skier. Born in Livermore, California, he grew up in Lake Tahoe, skiing Heavenly Valley. He is known for his appearances in ski films such as Greg Stump's ""The Blizzard of Aahhhs"", and for his trademark Mohawk hairstyle, often dyed blonde, purple or blue. Plake was a pioneer of extreme skiing in America. He is currently the host for the RSN program ""Reel Thrills"". According to his official biography: ""...it was his third-grade teacher who used a Möbius flip from the seminal '70s ski flick Outer Limits as a way of demonstrating math that turned his life. For Glen, there fell into place a connection between skiing and the wider world, an understanding that there were deeper forces beneath this sliding on snow. In that brief flash of insight, Plake knew that skiing held something greater for him."" Glen Plake married his wife Kimberly in 1991. The Plakes now base their winters in Chamonix, France. Notable achievements and appearances. Plake is a three-time World Hot Dog Ski champion. In 2002 Heavenly named Plake its “Ski.E.O.” In 2003 Plake was awarded a Ski Club of Great Britain Centenary Medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution and infuence upon snowsports. In October 2006 Plake joined Slovenian ski company Elan where he contributes in a design and development role. In 2006 Glen joined a French Steep Skiing expedition to India, successfully climbing and skiing three new routes in Indian Himalaya. The Rice on Ice film can be found on YouTube. In late 2007, Plake also appeared in a tourism commercial for the state of California, emphasizing winter sports. At one point he is seen ""flipping"" up his mohawk, and later in the commercial he is seen airborne on skis. In 2008 Plake, accompanied by climbing partner Remy Lecluse, had a successful expedition in the Villaconota range in Southern Peru.

wikipedia-2291152," Ilango Adigal  Ilango Adigal () was a Tamil poet and a Jain monk of the 2nd century AD/CE, who was instrumental in the creation of ""Silappathikaram,"" one of the five great epics of Tamil literature. His name is a pseudonym meaning 'Venerable Prince'. As per literary conventions at that time, he was not allowed to disclose his real name. Prince Ilango was the brother of Chera king Cheran Chenguttuvan (in modern day Kerala), in South India. Ilango Adigal was born in the Chera dynasty that ruled parts of what is now known as Kerala, but formed part of the Tamil Land. According to a legend, an astrologer predicted that he would become the ruler of the land and to obviate such a happening, especially when his elder brother the rightful heir was alive, the prince became a Jain monk taking the name of Ilango Adigal, Adigal indicating that he had become a Jain monk. He is reputed to be the brother of Chera king Senguttuvan, although there is no evidence in the Sangam poetries that the famous king had a brother. There are also claims that Ilango Adigal was a contemporary of Sattanar, the author of ""Manimekalai"". The prologues of each of these books tell us that each were read out to the author of the other pathigam 90. "
wikipedia-2291162," Prochirality  In stereochemistry, prochiral molecules are those that can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single step. If two identical substituents are attached to a ""sp""3-hybridized atom, the descriptors ""pro""-R and ""pro""-S are used to distinguish between the two. Promoting the ""pro""-R substituent to higher priority than the other identical substituent results in an ""R"" chirality center at the original ""sp""3-hybridized atom, and analogously for the ""Pro""-S substituent. A trigonal planar ""sp""2-hybridized atom can be converted to a chiral center when a substituent is added to the ""re"" or ""si"" face of the molecule. A face is labeled ""re"" if, when looking at that face, the substituents at the trigonal atom are arranged in decreasing Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority order in a clockwise order, and ""si"" if the priorities decrease in counter-clockwise order; but the designation of the resulting chiral center as ""S"" or ""R"" depends on the priority of the incoming group.

wikipedia-2291186," Corn stover  Corn stover consists of the leaves and stalks of maize (""Zea mays"" ssp. ""mays"" L.) plants left in a field after harvest and consists of the residue: stalk; the leaf, husk, and cob remaining in the field following the harvest of cereal grain.” Stover makes up about half of the yield of a crop and is similar to straw. Corn stover is a very common agricultural product in areas of large amounts of corn production. As well, the stover can also contain other weeds and grasses  the non-grain part of harvested corn and “has low water content and is very bulky.” Use. Stover can be grazed as forage or collected for use as fodder but is commonly not utilized. It can also be used as a fuel for bioenergy or as feedstock for bioproducts. Maize stover, together with other lignocellulosic biomass, provides about the potential 1.3 billion tons of raw materials that could produce future fuel in the next 50 years. In the Netherlands and Belgium large improvements on yield are achieved by harvesting the full plant and crushing it while harvesting. The substance is primarily used as the food for cows during the winter season. It is known as ""kuilmais"". Field corn and sweet corn, two different types of maize, have relatively similar corn stover products. Corn stover is not harvested in all areas where corn is produced. In fact, “some agronomists question whether taking stover out of the field annually will have a negative impact on soil fertility and structure.” The uses for corn stover are growing over time. One use of corn stover pertains to corn producers who also raise cattle. Corn stover can be beneficial to some cattle producers because the “corn stover can provide a low cost feed source for mid-gestation beef cows.” In addition to the stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs remaining in the field, kernels of grain may also be left over from harvest. These left over kernels, along with the corn stover, serve as an additional feed source for grazing cattle. Over time, the stalks will decrease in value as feed, so it is important to graze the corn stover as soon as possible after harvest. The amount of grazing possible on a field of corn stover is “between one and two months of grazing per cow per acre (50 cows on for one to two months).”  Another recent and important use for corn stover is biomass ethanol. Biomass ethanol is “ethanol made from non-grain plant materials known as biomass.” Ethanol production is made possible from the large availability of corn grain. Biomass ethanol would use the corn stover from the corn crop produced in areas around ethanol plants. Corn stover, due to the relative close proximity of the corn grain produced for ethanol production, “is by far the most abundant crop residue readily available today.” The free accessibility to corn stover makes it a prime candidate for biomass ethanol production. A new DuPont facility in Nevada, Iowa is expected to generate 30 million gallons annually of cellulosic biofuel produced from corn stover residues, its projected completion is mid-2014. Corn stover serves many purposes in today’s agricultural economy and will continue to do so in the future. Composition and properties. HHV: 19 MJ/kg DAF "
wikipedia-2291204," Genetically modified crops  Genetically modified crops (GMCs, GM crops, or biotech crops) are plants, the DNA of which has been modified using genetic engineering techniques. In most cases the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Examples include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide), or the production of a certain nutrient or pharmaceutical agent. Genetic engineering techniques are much more precise than mutagenesis (mutation breeding) where an organism is exposed to radiation or chemicals to create a non-specific but stable change. Other techniques by which humans modify plants include selective breeding; plant breeding, and somaclonal variation. Critics have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds, including ecological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law. GM crops also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs. Gene transfer in nature and traditional agriculture. Scientists first discovered that DNA naturally transfers between organisms in 1946. It is now known that there are several natural mechanisms for flow of genes, or (horizontal gene transfer), and that these occur in nature on a large scale – for example, it is a major mechanism for antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria, and it occurs between plant species. This is facilitated by transposons, retrotransposons, proviruses and other mobile genetic elements that naturally translocate to new sites in a genome. They often move to new species over an evolutionary time scale and play a major role in dynamic changes to chromosomes during evolution. The introduction of foreign germplasm into crops has been achieved by traditional crop breeders by artificially overcoming fertility barriers. A hybrid cereal was created in 1875, by crossing wheat and rye. Since then important traits have been introduced into wheat, including dwarfing genes and rust resistance. Plant tissue culture and the induction of mutations have also enabled humans to artificially alter the makeup of plant genomes. History. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. In 1987, Plant Genetic Systems (Ghent, Belgium), founded by Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, was the first company to develop genetically engineered (tobacco) plants with insect tolerance by expressing genes encoding for insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The People’s Republic of China was the first country to allow commercialized transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. The first genetically modified crop approved for sale in the U.S., in 1994, was the ""FlavrSavr"" tomato, which had a longer shelf life. In 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first commercially genetically engineered crop marketed in Europe. In 1995, Bt Potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. The following transgenic crops also received marketing approval in the US in 1995: canola with modified oil composition (Calgene), ""Bacillus thuringiensis"" (Bt) corn/maize (Ciba-Geigy), cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil (Calgene), Bt cotton (Monsanto), soybeans resistant to the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto), virus-resistant squash (Asgrow), and additional delayed ripening tomatoes (DNAP, Zeneca/Peto, and Monsanto). As of mid-1996, a total of 35 approvals had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop of carnations, with 8 different traits in 6 countries plus the EU. In 2000, with the production of golden rice, scientists genetically modified food to increase its nutrient value for the first time. Methods. Genetically engineered plants are generated in a laboratory by altering their genetic makeup. This is usually done by adding one or more genes to a plant's genome using genetic engineering techniques. Most genetically modified plants are generated by the biolistic method (particle gun) or by ""Agrobacterium tumefaciens"" mediated transformation. Plant scientists, backed by results of modern comprehensive profiling of crop composition, point out that crops modified using GM techniques are less likely to have unintended changes than are conventionally bred crops. In research tobacco and ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" are the most genetically modified plants, due to well developed transformation methods, easy propagation and well studied genomes. They serve as model organisms for other plant species. In the biolistic method, DNA is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the cell wall and membranes. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant genome inside the nucleus. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially monocots like wheat or maize, for which transformation using ""Agrobacterium tumefaciens"" has been less successful. The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the cellular tissue. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another method for the development of genetically engineered plants. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, resulting in a proliferation of plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumour growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA is removed from the bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize. Introducing new genes into plants requires a promoter specific to the area where the gene is to be expressed. For instance, if we want the gene to be expressed only in rice grains and not in leaves, then an endosperm-specific promoter would be used. The codons of the gene must also be optimized for the organism due to codon usage bias. The transgenic gene products should also be able to be denatured by heat so that they are destroyed during cooking. Flavr Savr tomato. The first commercialised genetically modified plants (Flavr Savr tomatoes) used RNAi technology, where the inserted DNA matched an endogenous gene already in the plant. When the inserted gene is expressed it can repress the translation of the endogenous protein. Host delivered RNAi systems are being developed, where the plant will express RNA that will interfere with insects, nematodes and other parasites' protein synthesis. This may provide a novel way of protecting plants from pests. Glyphosate resistance. One of the most famous kinds of GM crops are ""Roundup Ready"", or glyphosate-resistant. Glyphosate, (the active ingredient in Roundup) kills plants by interfering with the shikimate pathway in plants, which is essential for the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. More specifically, glyphosate inhibits the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). The shikimate pathway is not present in animals, which instead obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet. Some micro-organisms have a version of EPSPS that is resistant to glyphosate inhibition. One of these was isolated from an ""Agrobacterium"" strain CP4 (CP4 EPSPS) that was resistant to glyphosate. This CP4 EPSPS gene was cloned and transfected into soybeans. The CP4 EPSPS gene was engineered for plant expression by fusing the 5' end of the gene to a chloroplast transit peptide derived from the petunia EPSPS. This transit peptide was used because it had shown previously an ability to deliver bacterial EPSPS to the chloroplasts of other plants. The plasmid used to move the gene into soybeans was PV-GMGTO4. It contained three bacterial genes, two CP4 EPSPS genes, and a gene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) from ""Escherichia coli"" as a marker. The DNA was injected into the soybeans using the particle acceleration method. Soybean cultivar A54O3 was used for the transformation. The expression of the GUS gene was used as the initial evidence of transformation. GUS expression was detected by a staining method in which the GUS enzyme converts a substrate into a blue precipitate. Those plants that showed GUS expression were then taken and sprayed with glyphosate, and their tolerance was tested over many generations. Types of genetic engineering. Transgenic plants have genes inserted into them that are derived from another species. The inserted genes can come from species within the same kingdom (plant to plant) or between kingdoms (for example, bacteria to plant). In many cases the inserted DNA has to be modified slightly in order to correctly and efficiently express in the host organism. Transgenic plants are used to express proteins like the cry toxins from ""Bacillus thuringiensis"", herbicide resistant genes and antigens for vaccinations Transgenic carrots have been used to produce the drug Taliglucerase alfa which is used to treat Gaucher's disease. In the laboratory, transgenic plants have been modified to increase their photosynthesis (currently about 2% at most plants to the theoretic potential of 9–10%. This is possible by changing the rubisco enzyme (i.e. changing C3 plants into C4 plants), by placing the rubisco in a carboxysome, by adding pumps in the cell wall, by changing the leaf form/size. Plants have been engineered to exhibit bioluminescence which might one day be a sustainable alternative to electric lighting. Still other transgenic plants have been modified to fix ambient nitrogen in the plant. Cisgenic plants are made using genes found within the same species or a closely related one, where conventional plant breeding can occur. Some breeders and scientists argue that cisgenic modification is useful for plants that are difficult to crossbreed by conventional means (such as potatoes), and that plants in the cisgenic category should not require the same level of legal regulation as other genetically modified organisms. Business of GM Crops. The global value of biotech seed alone was US$13.2 billion in 2011, with the end product of commercial grain from biotech maize, soybean grain and cotton valued at approximately US$160 billion or more per year. Players in agriculture business markets include seed companies, agrochemical companies, distributors, farmers, grain elevators, and universities that develop new crops and whose agricultural extensions advise farmers on best practices. The largest share of the GMO crops planted globally are from seed created by the United States firm Monsanto. In 2007, Monsanto's trait technologies were planted on throughout the world, a growth of 13 percent from 2006. However, patents on the first Monsanto products to enter the marketplace will begin to expire in 2014, democratizing Monsanto products. Syngenta, DuPont (especially via its Pioneer Hi-Bred subsidiary, and Bayer CropScience are also major players in the US and Europe. In addition, a 2007 report from the European Joint Research Commission predicts that by 2015, more than 40 per cent of new GM plants entering the global marketplace will have been developed in Asia. In the corn market, Monsanto's triple-stack corn—which combines Roundup Ready 2-weed control technology with YieldGard (Bt) Corn Borer and YieldGard Rootworm insect control—is the market leader in the United States. U.S. corn farmers planted more than of triple-stack corn in 2008, and it is estimated the product could be planted on in 2014–2015. In the cotton market, Bollgard II with Roundup Ready Flex was planted on approximately of U.S. cotton in 2008. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA), in 2010 approximately 15 million farmers grew biotech crops in 29 countries. Over 90% of the farmers were resource-poor in developing countries. 6.5 million farmers in China and 6.3 million small farmers in India grew biotech crops (mostly Bacillus thuringiensis cotton). The Philippines, South Africa (biotech cotton, maize, and soybeans often grown by subsistence women farmers) and another twelve developing countries also grew biotech crops in 2009. 10 million more small and resource-poor farmers may have been secondary beneficiaries of Bt cotton in China. According to a review published in 2012 and based on data from the late 1990s and early 2000s, much of the GM crop grown each year is used for livestock feed, and increased demand for meat will lead to increased demand for GM crops with which to feed them. Feed grain usage as a percentage of total crop production is 70% for corn and more than 90% of oil seed meals such as soybeans. About 65 million metric tons of GM corn grains and about 70 million metric tons of soybean meals derived from GM soybean are fed to livestock each year. Uses, actual and proposed. GM crops grown today, or under experimental development, have been modified with traits intended to provide benefit to farmers, consumers, or industry. These traits include improved shelf life, disease resistance, stress resistance, herbicide resistance, pest resistance, production of useful goods such as biofuel or drugs, and ability to absorb toxins, for use in bioremediation of pollution. Due to high regulatory and research costs, the majority of genetically modified crops in agriculture consist of commodity crops, such as soybean, maize, cotton and rapeseed. Recently, some research and development has been targeted to enhancement of crops that are locally important in developing countries, such as insect-resistant cowpea for Africa and insect-resistant brinjal (eggplant) for India. Improved shelf life. The first genetically modified crop approved for sale in the U.S. was the ""FlavrSavr"" tomato, which had a longer shelf life. Improved nutrition. The GM oilseed crops on the market today offer improved oil profiles for processing or healthier edible oils. The GM crops in development offer a wider array of environmental and consumer benefits such as nutritional enhancement and drought and stress tolerance. GM plants are being developed by both private companies and public research institutions such as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre. Other examples include a genetically modified cassava with lower cyanogen glucosides and enhanced with protein and other nutrients, while golden rice, developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), has been discussed as a possible cure for Vitamin A deficiency. An international group of academics has generated a vitamin-enriched corn derived from South African white corn variety M37W with 169x increase in beta carotene, 6x the vitamin C and 2x folate – it is not in production anywhere, but proves that this can be done. Stress resistance. Plants engineered to tolerate non-biological stresses like drought, frost, high Soil salinity, and nitrogen starvation or with increased nutritional value (""e.g."" Golden rice) were in development in 2011. Herbicide resistance. Tobacco plants have been engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil. And many crops have created that are resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. As weeds have grown resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides used in concert with resistant GM crops, companies are developing crops engineered to become resistant to multiple herbicides to allow farmers to use a mixed group of two, three, or four different chemicals. Pathogen resistance – insects or viruses. Tobacco, corn, rice and many other crops, have been generated that express genes encoding for insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Papaya, potatoes, and squash have been engineered to resist viral pathogens, such as cucumber mosaic virus which, despite its name, infects a wide variety of plants. Production of biofuels. Algae, both hybrid and GM, is under development by several companies for the production of biofuels. Jatropha has also been modified to improve its qualities for fuel product. Swiss-based Syngenta has received USDA approval to market a maize seed trademarked Enogen, which has been genetically modified to convert its own starch to sugar to speed the process of making ethanol for biofuel. In 2013, the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology was investigating poplar trees genetically engineered to contain less lignin so that they would be more suitable for conversion into biofuels. Lignin is the critical limiting factor when using wood to make bio-ethanol because lignin limits the accessibility of cellulose microfibrils to depolymerization by enzymes. Production of useful by-products. Drugs. Bananas have been developed, but are not in production, that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B. Tobacco plants have been developed and studied, but are not in production, that can produce therapeutic antibodies. Materials. Several companies and labs are working on engineering plants that can be used to make bioplastics. Potatoes that produce more industrially useful starches have been developed as well. Bioremediation. Scientists at the University of York developed a weed (""Arabidopsis thaliana"") that contains genes from bacteria that can clean up TNT and RDX-explosive contaminants from the soil: It was hoped that this weed would eliminate this pollution. 16 million hectares in the USA (1.5% of the total surface) are estimated to be contaminated with TNT and RDX. However the weed ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" was not tough enough to withstand the environment on military test grounds and research is continuing with the University of Washington to develop a tougher native grass. Genetically modified plants have also been used for bioremediation of contaminated soils. Mercury, selenium and organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), TNT and RDX explosive contaminants have been removed from soils by transgenic plants containing genes for bacterial enzymes. Extent of worldwide use of GM crops. In the United States, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports on the total area of GMO varieties planted. According to National Agricultural Statistics Service, the states published in these tables represent 81–86 percent of all corn planted area, 88–90 percent of all soybean planted area, and 81–93 percent of all upland cotton planted area (depending on the year). USDA does not collect data for global area. Estimates are produced by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) and can be found in the report, ""Global Status of Commercialized Transgenic Crops: 2007"". Farmers have widely adopted GM technology (see figure). Between 1996 and 2011, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops had increased by a factor of 94, from to 1,600,000 km2 (395 million acres). 10% of the world's crop lands were planted with GM crops in 2010. As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain. One of the key reasons for this widespread adoption is the perceived economic benefit the technology brings to farmers. For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then invest time, fuel, and equipment in applying them. However critics have disputed whether yields are higher and whether chemical use is less, with GM crops. See Genetically modified food controversies article for information. In the US, by 2009/10, 93% of the planted area of soybeans, 93% of cotton, 86% of corn and 95% of the sugar beet were genetically modified varieties. Genetically modified soybeans carried herbicide-tolerant traits only, but maize and cotton carried both herbicide tolerance and insect protection traits (the latter largely the ""Bacillus thuringiensis"" Bt insecticidal protein). These constitute ""input-traits"" which are aimed to financially benefit the producers, but may have indirect environmental benefits and marginal cost benefits to consumers. The Grocery Manufacturers of America estimated in 2003 that 70–75% of all processed foods in the U.S. contained a GM ingredient. Europe has relatively few genetically engineered crops with the exception of Spain where one fifth of maize grown is genetically engineered, and smaller amounts in five other countries. The EU had a 'de facto' ban on the approval of new GM crops, from 1999 until 2004; in a controversial move. GM crops are now ""regulated"" by the EU. Developing countries grew 50 percent of genetically engineered crops in 2011. In recent years there has been rapid growth in the area sown in developing countries. A total of 29 countries worldwide grew GM crops in 2011 by approximately 16.7 million farmers and 50% of GM crops grown worldwide were grown in developing countries. For example, the largest increase in crop area planted to GM crops in 2011 was in Brazil (303,000 km2 versus 254,000 km2 in 2010). There has also been rapid and continuing expansion of GM cotton varieties in India since 2002 with 106,000 km2 of GM cotton harvested in India in 2011. However the use of GM crops in India has been controversial, as discussed in detail in the GM controversies article. According to the 2011 ISAAA brief: ""While 29 countries planted commercialized biotech crops in 2010, an additional 31 countries, totaling 60 have granted regulatory approvals for biotech crops for import for food and feed use and for release into the environment since 1996... A total of 1,045 approvals have been granted for 196 events (NB: an ""event"" is a specific genetic modification in a specific species) for 25 crops. Thus, biotech crops are accepted for import for food and feed use and for release into the environment in 60 countries, including major food importing countries like Japan, which do not plant biotech crops. Of the 60 countries that have granted approvals for biotech crops, USA tops the list followed by Japan, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, New Zealand, the European Union, and Taiwan. Maize has the most events approved (65) followed by cotton (39), canola (15), potato and soybean (14 each). The event that has received regulatory approval in most countries is herbicide tolerant soybean event GTS-40-3-2 with 25 approvals (EU=27 counted as 1 approval only), followed by insect resistant maize MON810 with 23 approvals, herbicide tolerant maize NK603 with 22 approvals each, and insect resistant cotton (MON1445) with 14 approvals worldwide."" Examples of genetically modified crops. Currently, there are a number of food species for which a genetically modified version is being commercially grown (percent modified in the table below are mostly 2009/2010 data). Effects on farming practices. Managing emergence of resistance. Constant exposure to a toxin creates evolutionary pressure for pests resistant to that toxin. One method of reducing resistance is the creation of non-Bt crop refuges to allow some nonresistant insects to survive and maintain a susceptible population. To reduce the chance an insect would become resistant to a Bt crop, the commercialization of transgenic cotton and maize in 1996 was accompanied with a management strategy to prevent insects from becoming resistant to Bt crops, and insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops planted in the USA and other countries. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any resistance genes that are recessive are greatly diluted within the population. This means that with sufficiently high levels of transgene expression, nearly all of the heterozygotes (S/s), i.e., the largest segment of the pest population carrying a resistance allele, will be killed before they reach maturity, thus preventing transmission of the resistance gene to their progeny. The planting of refuges (i. e., fields of nontransgenic plants) adjacent to fields of transgenic plants increases the likelihood that homozygous resistant (s/s) individuals and any surviving heterozygotes will mate with susceptible (S/S) individuals from the refuge, instead of with other individuals carrying the resistance allele. As a result, the resistance gene frequency in the population would remain low. Nevertheless, limitations can affect the success of the high-dose/refuge strategy. For example, expression of the Bt gene can vary. For instance, if the temperature is not ideal, this stress can lower the toxin production and make the plant more susceptible. More importantly, reduced late-season expression of toxin has been documented, possibly resulting from DNA methylation of the promoter. So, while the high-dose/refuge strategy has been successful at prolonging the durability of Bt crops, this success has also had much to do with key factors independent of management strategy, including low initial resistance allele frequencies, fitness costs associated with resistance, and the abundance of non-Bt host plants that have supplemented the refuges planted as part of the resistance management strategy. Companies that produce Bt seed are addressing this as well, by introducing plants with multiple Bt proteins. Monsanto did this with Bt cotton in India, where the product was rapidly adopted. Regulation. The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety Controversy. Critics have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds, including ecological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law (although this latter issue applies equally to any plant variety). GM crops also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs. See the genetically modified food controversies article for discussion of issues about GM crops and GM food. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive legislation in most countries. "
wikipedia-2291243," Gay Purr-ee  Gay Purr-ee is an animated film musical produced by United Productions of America and released by Warner Bros. in 1962. It features the voice talent of Judy Garland in her first and only animated-film role, as well as Robert Goulet in his first feature film. Plot. The story is set in 1895 France and takes place predominantly in Paris. However, it begins on a farm in rural Provence. The lovely housecat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love, but the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a ""clumsy country clod"". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of the glamour and sophistication of Paris (""Take my Hand, Paree""), Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city, where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice (""The Money Cat""). Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as ""The Belle of all Paris"". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat in Pittsburgh known as ""Mr. Henry Phtt"" . Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette.  Training does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées and the Mewlon Rouge. Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but are waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine sewers. By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice (known as ""Virtue-Mousety""), who sees a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk (""Bubbles""), and sells them as mousers to a ship bound for Alaska. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem, regardless of size, can be broken up into manageable pieces, by remarking that even the mighty ocean is made up of little drops of water. Jaune Tom has a vision of Mewsette singing about how no problem is unconquerable, and the importance of never giving up (""Little Drops of Rain""). Mewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of paintings of her by such famous artists as Claude Monet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Seurat, Henri Rousseau, Amedeo Modigliani, Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso (an opportunity for the animators to indulge in some artistic parodies), so that he can send them to Mr. Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check to pay his ""sister"", Mme. Reubens-Chatte (using disappearing ink, so that the check is worthless), and takes Mewsette to Notre Dame. There, he reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her to enter a luggage crate, but after describing Mr. Phtt as fat and old, she manages to escape him and his sidekicks. In the resulting chase scene, she leads Meowrice and his henchmen onto a bulldog, who injures him badly enough to put him out of action for six weeks. Meanwhile, his sycophants (who are nowhere near as intelligent as he is) comb the city without success, searching for Mewsette. Meanwhile, not long after they reach Alaska (a howling wilderness of snow), Jaune Tom and Robespierre strike gold. Now wealthy, the two cats hurry back to Paris. A disillusioned and homeless Mewsette wanders around the streets of Paris, eventually ending up sitting atop a bridge over the river, considering ending her misery (""Paris is a Lonely Town""), but is captured by Meowrice and his sidekicks. She is taken to the Gare du Nord railway station, en route to a boat to America, and all hope seems lost, when Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive. They have been aided by Mme. Ruebens-Chatte, who is irritated that her own ""brother"" double-crossed her and tears up the worthless check. In a humorously over-the-top fight scene inside the boxcar of a moving train, the three heroes defeat Meowrice and pack him into the crate intended for Mewsette, doubtless that this will be a nasty surprise for Mr. Phtt. The film concludes with Mewsette, Jaune Tom and Robespierre enjoying the high life in Paris that Mewsette was seeking when she left home (""Mewsette Finale""). Voice cast. Source: Production. Chuck Jones helped write the movie's story, and ultimately produced the project, moonlighting for UPA in violation of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Cartoons. One of his animators, Abe Levitow, directed the film. According to the production notes on the DVD edition, it was Garland who suggested that her ""Wizard of Oz"" songwriters, Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, should write and compose the songs for ""Gay Purr-ee"". When Warner Bros. picked up the film for distribution, they discovered that it was Jones' work. After a long debate with management over the details of Jones' exclusivity agreement, Warner fired Jones in July 1962 and laid his staff off after they hd finished their next cartoon. Jones later hired his old unit after Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed at his first independent studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions. The film was theatrically released in October, 1962 to indifferent reviews and low box-office receipts. Soundtrack. On November 4, 2003, Rhino Handmade, a division of the Warner Music Group, released the soundtrack on CD. This was identical to the 1962 LP version but contained 5 additional demo tracks. The demo tracks are performed by Harold Arlen and E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg the composers of the songs for the movie. They were also the primary song writers for the music of ""The Wizard of Oz"", the 1939 Garland feature. Garland has stated that the song ""Little Drops of Rain"" was one of her favorite songs. The CD tracklisting is as follows: "

Some of the books have been translated into other languages, including Spanish. "
wikipedia-2291281," Jan T. Gross  Jan Tomasz Gross (born in 1947) is a Polish-American historian and sociologist. He is the Norman B. Tomlinson '16 and '48 Professor of War and Society and Professor of History at Princeton University. Biography. Jan T. Gross was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1947 to Hanna Szumańska, a Polish mother, who was a member of the Polish resistance (Armia Krajowa) and Zygmunt Gross, a Polish-Jewish father who was a PPS member. His mother, risking her own life, helped his father to survive the German Nazi occupation of Poland. They married after the war. Jan Tomasz Gross studied physics at the Warsaw University. He was among the young dissidents called ""Komandosi"", and consequently among the university students involved in the protest movement known as the ""March Events,"" the Polish student and intellectual protests of 1968. Gross was expelled from the university, arrested and jailed for five months. As a consequence, and because the Polish government permitted the emigration of ""people of Jewish origin"" at that time, he emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1969. In 1975 he earned a Ph.D. in sociology from Yale University, and has taught at Yale, NYU, and Paris. He acquired U.S. citizenship and currently teaches history at Princeton University. Gross was awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in 1996, an award granted to foreigners for their exceptional role in cooperation between Poland and other nations. He was also a Senior Fulbright Research, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial, and Rockefeller Humanities Fellow. Controversy. Gross came to public attention on the occasion of his several publications. Then he was in the center of a controversy due to the publication of his 2001 book on the Jedwabne massacre, """", which examined a massacre of the Polish Jews in Jedwabne village in Nazi-occupied Poland. In his book Gross writes that the massacre was perpetrated by Poles and not by the German occupiers, as previously assumed. The claims were the subject of vigorous debate in Poland. Norman Finkelstein accused Gross of exploiting the Holocaust. Norman Davies describes ""Neighbors"" as ""deeply unfair to Poles"". A subsequent investigation conducted by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance did not support Gross' thesis on issues such as the number of people murdered, and the extent of Nazi German involvement in the massacre. Gross' ""Fear - Anti-Semitism in Poland after Auschwitz"", which deals with antisemitism and violence against Jews in post-war Poland was published in the United States in 2006 and had received praise in the United States; its Polish version, published in 2008, got mixed media reception restarting a nationwide debate about antisemitism in Poland during World War II and after. The book has been welcomed by some Polish historians and criticized by others who do not deny the facts Jan Gross presented in his book, but dispute his interpretation.  Marek Edelman, one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising said in an interview with the ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" daily, ""Postwar violence against Jews in Poland was mostly not about anti-Semitism, murdering Jews was pure banditry."" Gross' ""Neighbors"" and ""Fear"" were subjected to scholarly criticism by historian Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, whose interpretations directly challenged Gross. Gross' latest book, "" (Golden Harvest)"", co-written with his wife Irena Grudzińska-Gross and published in March 2011, about Poles enriching themselves at the expense of Jews murdered in the Holocaust, has also attracted criticism that it only shows one side of a complex issue. The Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, commented: ""Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say."" The head of Znak, the book's publisher, stated: ""It does not purport to provide a comprehensive overview of Polish rural communities' actions... The authors focus on the most horrid events, on robberies and killings. Those who say the book is anti-Polish make no sense."" Gross's academic critics have argued that ""Golden Harvest"" is based on a one-sided interpretation of its sources, the vast majority of them secondary ones. Further, they have taken issue with what they consider a grossly unfair portrayal of marginal wartime social pathologies as an all-national Polish norm. They also see his interpretation of Polish history as ""neo-Stalinist"" due to its resemblance to postwar Stalinist propaganda alleging mass Polish collaboration and collusion with Nazi Germany, a claim used to justify the Soviet occupation of Poland.

wikipedia-2291293," Frank Deford  Frank Deford (born Benjamin Franklin Deford III on December 16, 1938 in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American sportswriter and novelist. In addition to his 50-year tenure at ""Sports Illustrated"", where he now holds the title of Senior Contributing Writer, Deford appears weekly on National Public Radio and as Senior Correspondent for ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" on HBO. He has written 18 books, nine of them novels. A member of the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame, Deford was six times voted Sportswriter of the Year by the members of that organization, and was twice voted Magazine Writer of the Year by the ""Washington Journalism Review"". In 2012 he became the first magazine recipient of the Red Smith Award. In 2013 he will be presented with the William Allen White Citation for ""excellence in journalism"" by the University of Kansas and will become the first sports journalist ever to receive the National Press Foundation's highest honor, the W.M. Kiplinger Award for Distinguished Contributions to Journalism. Deford's archives are held by the University of Texas, where an annual lecture is presented in his name. He is a long-time advocate for research and treatment of cystic fibrosis. Background. After graduation from Princeton in 1962, Deford began his career as a researcher at ""Sports Illustrated."" In addition to his writing at ""Sports Illustrated"", he was a commentator on CNN and has been a correspondent for HBO's ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" since 1995; and a regular Wednesday commentator for NPR since 1980. His 1981 novel ""Everybody's All-American"" was named one of ""Sports Illustrated's"" Top 25 Sports Books of All Time and was later made into a film of the same title. Much of Deford's fiction is, however, set outside of the sports realm. The most recent of his novels is the acclaimed ""Bliss, Remembered"", a 1930s romance between a pretty young American and the son of a German diplomat; the story is written from the point of view of the woman. He has also been the screenwriter on the films ""Trading Hearts"" (1987) and ""Four Minutes"" (2005). In 1989, Deford left ""Sports Illustrated"" and NPR to serve as editor-in-chief of ""The National"", the first daily U.S. sports newspaper. It debuted January 31, 1990 but folded after only eighteen months. The newspaper was published daily in tabloid format. It was praised for its editorial content, but was a victim of circulation problems. After then writing for ""Newsweek"" and ""Vanity Fair"", Deford subsequently returned to ""Sports Illustrated"" as Senior Contributing Writer. Deford served as chairman of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for seventeen years, until 1999, and remains chairman emeritus. He became involved in cystic fibrosis education and advocacy after his daughter, Alexandra, was diagnosed with the illness in 1972. After Alex died on January 19, 1980, at the age of eight, Deford chronicled her life in the memoir """". The book was made into a movie starring Craig T. Nelson as Deford, Bonnie Bedelia as his wife Carol and Gennie James as Alex. Deford grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, the oldest of three sons, and attended the Calvert School and Gilman School in Baltimore. He is a graduate of Princeton University and now resides in Westport, Connecticut, with his wife, the former Carol Penner, who had been a fashion model. They have two surviving children: Christian (b. 1969) and Scarlet (b. 1980). Scarlet was adopted as an infant from the Philippines a few months after the loss of Alex. Deford has two grandchildren; Annabel (b. 2010) and Hunter (b. 2012). Deford met his wife in Delaware and they were married in Newport, Rhode Island in 1965. "
wikipedia-2291342," Virtual folder  In computing, a virtual folder generally denotes an organizing principle for files that is not dependent on location in a hierarchical directory tree. Instead, they consist of scripts that coalesce results from a data store, which may be a database or a custom index, and presents them visually in the format in which folder views are presented. A virtual folder can be thought of as a view that lists all files tagged with a certain tag, and thus a simulation of a folder whose dynamic contents can be assembled on the fly, when requested. It is related in concept to several other topics in computer science, with names including saved search, saved query, and filtering. Technology. Virtual folders provide a means for making it easier for users to find files that are content-related, such as by project. The user needs to specify criteria and all files matching the criteria are dynamically aggregated into the virtual folder. Files in a virtual folder are not limited to any single physical location on the hard drive, as is the case with traditional folders, but can be in any location. In fact, files in a virtual folder do not even need to be stored as files on the hard drive. They may be on a network share or in a custom application datastore such as e-mail inbox or even a database. Documents cannot be ""stored"" in a virtual folder, since physically a virtual folder is just a file storing a search query. Any attempt to store a file in a virtual folder, depending on the implementation, is redirected to some physical store. Most implementations speed up searching by pre-indexing the hard drive, or the locations where the search has to be performed. So when searching is to be done, the index, which is a representation of the entire data suitable for fast searching, is used. Since the entire folder hierarchy is not accessed, the search is completed much faster. Implementations. Virtual folders are a well-established construct in operating systems. BeOS included a version of virtual folders referred to as ""saved queries"", that has since influenced the development of virtual folder features in operating systems like Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. These virtual folders are populated dynamically by executing a search on the entire file system, or a subset of it, or by using the cached version of the search. History. BeOS. The initial developer preview of the operating system, released in October 1995, included database-like functionality to make it easier for users to manage their files. To do this the filesystem indexes certain file attributes to allow for fast searching. By default the filesystem indexes the filename, size and last modified timestamp automatically, but could also create indexes for other attributes when told to by either an application or by the user. When a user performs a file search, a file is created in the folder ""/boot/home/queries"" with a name derived from the content of the query and the date and time of the search, such as ""Name = Western Infirmary - Mar 21, 11:59:40 PM"". The query criteria of the search is stored in an attribute of the file called ""qrystr"". When the file is opened, the filesystem indexes were queried and a Tracker window is opened with an up-to-date list of files that match the criteria. Additional features were added to search with subsequent releases. Release 2 introduced the ability to edit saved queries, and Release 3 gave the users the chance to define their own names for saved queries. Before Release 4 in 1998, all queries were stored indefinitely. However with R4, the BeOS developers introduced a seven day limit on all queries. If a user wanted a query to stay around longer, they could uncheck a ""Temporary"" flag in the Find dialog. Mac OS X. One of the lead developers of the BeOS filesystem, Dominic Giampaolo, was also involved in adding a virtual folder system in Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system. In April 2005, Apple released Mac OS X v10.4, with their implementation of virtual folders called Smart Folders. These folders are actually dynamically updated by the Spotlight engine to contain content that match certain criteria. For example, this could be used to give you a folder containing all the Word documents containing the word ""shpadoinkle"" that have been edited within the last 7 days. Smart Folders are created by saving a Spotlight search, which records the search criteria in a Property list file with a .savedSearch extension and, by default, saves them in the ""/Users/username/Library/Saved Searches"" folder. There are many variants of the Smart Folder concept that can be seen in applications that use the Spotlight engine, usually identified by a gear symbol on its purple-hued icon. For example: Smart Mailboxes in Mail and Smart Groups in Address Book. Before Spotlight earlier versions of Mac OS X had a similar concept in the iApps (iTunes and iPhoto), but these did not use the system-wide Spotlight engine. Windows. In November 2006, Microsoft released Windows Vista which allows saving any search query as a ""Search Folder"", which is a type of virtual folder. Whenever it is accessed the search is run and the results are presented as if a folder is being shown, with its contents being aliases to the actual files. The exception is that, in certain scenarios, the search is not run and a cached version of the folder is shown. The same ""Saved Search"" approach exists in Windows XP with results generated quickly from an index when Windows Indexing Service is enabled and presented in a similar virtual folder. The search parameters can be saved as a .fnd file for Windows XP searches. A ""Search Folder"" is just an XML file, which stores the query in a form that can be used by the Windows search subsystem. As such, it can be created anywhere in the filesystem wherever a normal file can be created, by saving a search from the Windows Search system. Whenever such files are accessed, the search is executed on the entire hard drive and the matches are aggregated and presented as a virtual folder. In the early development builds of Windows Vista, there were some pre-configured Virtual Folders, for Music, Pictures, Documents and the like, which were used as replacement of their special folder counterpart. Windows Vista also supported manual creation of custom virtual folders. However, Microsoft felt that Virtual Folders will be too confusing to the general public and hence they are not being used as the replacement of physical folders, as was the original goal. Unlike in previous versions, where Start Menu icons led to Virtual Folders for Music, Pictures and Documents, build 5308 onwards led to physical folders of the same name, which are exactly like ""My Documents"" and other similar folders in Windows XP. In Windows 7, the concept of virtual folders has been significantly realized with the introduction of the ""Libraries"" feature. Similar to Virtual Folders, a Library is simply an XML file but with the .library-ms extension and is essentially a collection of files with specified attributes presented in a familiar folder-style visual interface. Users can access Libraries directly from the taskbar via the Library button. GNOME. In GNOME 2.14, a saved search is a virtual folder whose contents are the result of a Nautilus search, which has multiple backends. The contents of these folders are determined dynamically when the folder is opened, and updated automatically when files are created or modified. Other implementations. Email clients. Virtual folders are also a well-established construct in email clients. In early 1991, the Emacs-based mail reader VM provided a virtual folder facility in its version 5.09. VM allows the users to define virtual folders using rules, taking their mail content from one or more physical folders and based on selection criteria dealing with dates, authors, recipient, subject, message body etc. Virtual folders can also be created interactively and take content from previously defined virtual folders, thereby cascading the selection criteria. The Evolution email client created by Helix Code in 2000, also incorporated virtual folders. Folders can be created that automatically list e-mails matching user-defined rules, for example all e-mail from a particular address or all e-mail that includes a specific keyword. The Opera web browser released a new mail client (beta in November 2002, final version in Jan 2003), M2 in which virtual folders (called access points) were used for all email management. Virtual folders were automatically made for active contacts, for attachments and for assigned labels. Virtual folders were also automatically generated whenever a search was performed, and manual virtual folders could use multiple logical mail header rules for their construction (including using Regular Expressions). Microsoft Outlook 2003 added a similar feature called ""Search Folders"". Gmail, first released in 2004, bases all of its mail management on virtual folders accessed via labels. Mozilla Thunderbird also has the ability to create search folders and from version 1.5 allowed the search to be done over more than one email account. Music clients. In July 2002, Apple announced version 3 of iTunes which includes ""Smart Playlists"" which can be considered a variant of a virtual folder. The only difference is that the search executed on accessing them is not on the file system's folder hierarchy, but on their internal data-store. Microsoft also added a similar feature to version 9 of Windows Media Player in Windows XP called ""Auto Playlists"" in 2003. "
wikipedia-2291349," South Col  The South Col usually refers to the sharp-edged notch or pass between Mount Everest and Lhotse, the highest and fourth highest mountains in the world. When climbers attempt to climb Everest from the southeast ridge in Nepal, their final camp (usually Camp IV) is situated on the South Col. The South Col is typically ravaged by high winds, leaving it free of significant snow accumulation.  The South Col was first reached by Edouard Wyss-Dunant's 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition that failed to reach the summit. The following year, when Mount Everest was first climbed, Wilfrid Noyce and the Sherpa Annullu were the first climbers on the expedition to reach the col. According to John Hunt, the expedition leader: Once on the South Col, climbers have entered the death zone — Altitude sickness is a significant threat at this elevation and can easily prove fatal. It is also difficult to sleep, and most climbers' digestive systems have significantly slowed or completely stopped. This is because it is more efficient at this altitude for the body to use stored energy sources than to digest new food. Most climbers will begin using supplemental oxygen here and have a maximum of only two or three days for making summit bids. Clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp. Climbers rarely get a second chance to return to the South Col in a specific expedition. "

Eventually, Brad manipulates her into admitting that she is responsible for the murder. Having recorded their conversation, she is soon arrested for murder. In the end, it is announced that she was tried as a juvenile, and would be released from prison at age 21. "

The bank was established under the Bank of Tanzania Act 1965. However, in 1995, the government decided that the central bank had too many responsibilities, and was thus hindering its other objectives. As a result, the government introduced the Bank of Tanzania Act 1995, which gave the bank the single objective of monetary policy.  It is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of ten people, four of whom are ""ex officio"" members which have three advisory committees that can assist them. The bank is headed by its Governor, assisted by three deputy governors in Administration, Economic and financial policies and Financial stability. Financial Inclusion. The Bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico. Criticism. Recently, Bank of Tanzania was involved in an incident which resulted in an audit of its External Arrears Account.

wikipedia-2291506," What Is and What Should Never Be  ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" is a song by English rock band Led Zeppelin on their 1969 album ""Led Zeppelin II"". It was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. This was one of the first songs on which Page used his soon-to-become trademark Gibson Les Paul for recording. The production makes liberal use of stereo as the guitars pan back and forth between channels. Robert Plant's vocals were phased during the verses. This was also one of the first songs recorded by the band for which Robert Plant received writing credit. According to rock journalist Stephen Davis, the author of the Led Zeppelin biography ""Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga"", the lyrics for this song reflect a romance Plant had with his wife's younger sister. ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" was performed live at Led Zeppelin concerts between 1969 and 1972 (and played once in 1973). A live version taken from a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970 can be seen on the ""Led Zeppelin DVD"". Another was included on disc two of the live triple album ""How The West Was Won"". The song inspired the name of an episode of the popular teen drama ""One Tree Hill"", and the name of an episode of the paranormal drama ""Supernatural"", as well as an episode of popular half-hour comedy ""That 70s Show"", and one from the action drama ""Covert Affairs"". Billy Joel also played it as part of the intro to the ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" medley on the 1997 ""VH1 Storytellers"" episode on his career. Record producer Rick Rubin has remarked, ""The descending riff ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" is amazing: It's like a bow is being drawn back, and then it releases. The rhythm of the vocals is almost like a rap. It's insane — one of their most psychedelic songs.""  The song was covered by Haley Reinhart during the tenth season of ""American Idol"".  The song can also be heard in the 2012 film ""Silver Linings Playbook"".  "
wikipedia-2291514," Agaric  An agaric is a type of fungal fruiting body characterized by the presence of a pileus (cap) that is clearly differentiated from the stipe (stalk), with lamellae (gills) on the underside of the pileus. ""Agaric"" can also refer to a basidiomycete species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body. An archaic usage of the word agaric meant 'tree-fungus' (after Latin ""agaricum""); however, that meaning was superseded by the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when Linnaeus used the generic name ""Agaricus"" for gilled mushrooms. Most species of agarics are classified in the Agaricales, however, this type of fruiting body is thought to have evolved several times independently, hence the Russulales, Boletales, Hymenochaetales, and several other groups of basidiomycetes also contain agaric species. Older systems of classification place all agarics in the Agaricales, and some (mostly older) sources still use ""agarics"" as a common name for the Agaricales. Contemporary sources now tend to use the term euagarics when referring only to members of the Agaricales. ""Agaric"" is also sometimes used as a common name for members of the genus ""Agaricus"", as well as for members of other genera, for example, ""Amanita muscaria"" is sometimes called ""fly agaric"".

wikipedia-2291581," Ode to Psyche  ""Ode to Psyche"" is a poem by John Keats written in spring 1819. The poem is the first of his 1819 odes, which include ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" and ""Ode to a Nightingale"". ""Ode to Psyche"" is an experiment in the ode genre, and Keats's attempt at an expanded version of the sonnet format that describes a dramatic scene. The poem serves as an important departure from Keats's early poems, which frequently describe an escape into the pleasant realms of one's imagination. Keats uses the imagination to show the narrator's intent to resurrect Psyche and reincarnate himself into Eros(love). Keats attempts this by dedicating an ""untrodden region"" of his mind to the worship of the neglected goddess.  Background. Keats was never a professional writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included ""La Belle Dame sans Merci"" and ""Ode to Psyche"", the first of a series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed, but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, ""The following poem, the last I have written, is the first and only one with which I have taken even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this one I have done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit."" Keats was exposed to a few sources of the Psyche myth. His contemporary sources for the myth included Lempriere's ""Classical Dictionary"" and Mary Tighe's ""Psyche"", an 1805 work that Keats read as a child and returned to in 1818. Keats wrote to his brother George, just a few months before writing ""Ode to Psyche"", to say that he was no longer delighted by Tighe's writing. Dissatisfied, he turned to Apuleius's ""Golden Ass"", translated by William Adlington in 1566, and read through the earlier version of the Cupid and Psyche myth. After reading the work and realizing that the myth was established during the twilight of Roman mythology, Keats wrote to George: ""You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour—and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I am more orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected."" Structure. ""Ode to Psyche"", Keats's 67 line ode, was the first of his major odes of 1819. As such, the poem is an experiment in the ode structure that he was to then rely on for his next five odes. Although Keats spent time considering the language of the poem, the choice of wording and phrasing is below that found within his later works, including ""Hyperion"" or the odes that followed. ""Ode to Psyche"" is important because it is Keats's first attempt at an altered sonnet form that would include longer more lines and would end with a message or truth. Also, he did not want the poem to be based simply around that message, so he incorporated narrative elements, such as plot and characters, along with a preface to the poem. Of these additions, the use of a preface was discontinued in his next odes along with the removal of details that describe setting within the poems; they would only be implied within later odes. H. W. Garrod, in his analysis of Keats's sonnet form, believes that Keats took various aspects of sonnet forms and incorporated only those that he thought would benefit his poetry. In particular, Keats relies on Petrarch's sonnet structure and the ""pouncing rhymes"" that are found within Petrarch's octave stanzas. However, M. R. Ridley disputes that Keats favours Petrarch and claims that the odes incorporate a Shakespearean rhyme scheme. Regardless of which sonnet structure was favoured over the other, Keats wanted to avoid the downsides of both forms. ""Ode to Psyche"" begins with an altered Shakespearean rhyme scheme of ababcdcdeffeef. The use of rhyme does not continue throughout the poem, and the lines that follow are divided into different groups: a quatrain, couplets, and a line on its own. These are then followed by a series of twelve lines that are modelled after the Shakespearean sonnet form, but lack the final couplet. The next lines are of two quatrains, with cddc rhyme, followed by two lines that repeat the previous rhymes, and then a final quatrain, with efef rhyme. Poem. The poem does not describe the plot of the original Cupid and Psyche myth. Instead, the poem, according to Harold Bloom, ""has little to do with the accepted myth"". In the original myth, Aphrodite punishes Psyche, a well admired girl, by having Cupid use his power to make her fall in love. Cupid, instead, falls in love with her, but he could only be with her in the cover of darkness in order to disguise his identity. Curious, she uses a light to reveal Cupid's identity, but he flees from her presence. Psyche begins to search after Cupid, and Aphrodite forces her to perform various tasks before she could be united with her love. After nearly dying from one of the tasks, Cupid asks Zeus to transform Psyche into a goddess so the two can be together.  The action of ""Ode to Psyche"" begins with a narrator witnessing two individuals embracing. The narrator immediately recognizes Cupid and is astonished when he recognizes Psyche: The third stanza describes how Psyche, though a newer Goddess, is better than the other deities. However, she is neglected while the others were worshipped:  The previous list of what Psyche lacks in terms of religious worship only describes external symbols of worship. In the fourth stanza, the narrator emphasizes the internal when he describes how he is inspired by Psyche: The narrator, inspired by young goddess, becomes her priest. His imagination allows him to join with both the natural and supernatural elements of Psyche, and his form of worship is within himself while ""Ode to Psyche"" the poem serves as a song in praise of the goddess. The narrator becomes the prophet for Psyche and says in the final stanza:  In the conclusion of the poem, the narrator metaphorically says that he will expand his consciousness, which would allow him to better understand both the good and the bad of the world. This will allow the narrator to attain a new sense of inspiration while providing Psyche with a sanctuary: Themes. The moment that Cupid and Psyche are revealed is an example of ""Keatsian intensity"" as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including ""Ode on Indolence"", ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"", and ""Ode to a Nightingale"". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.  Part of the problem within ""Ode to Psyche"" is in the narrator's claim that Psyche was neglected since she became a goddess later than the other Greco-Roman deities. As such, the narrator serves as a prophetic figure who is devoted to the soul. Worship towards the soul is through use of the imagination, an idea that shows the influence of William Wordsworth upon the poem's themes. In particular, the lines are reminiscent of the description of inspiration and the muse within Wordsworth's ""The Recluse"". To serve Psyche, the narrator of ""Ode to Psyche"" seeks to worship her by thoroughly exploring the regions of his mind. However, the temple dedicated to the goddess within his mind does not yet exist.  This reveals that there is a struggle between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within a small part of the mind. This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has ""no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps no truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself."" However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem. Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does rejoice in exercising the imagination. In addition to the theme of dedicating one's self to the mind, the theme of reception plays heavily upon the poem's presentation; Andrew Bennett states that the poem, like all poems, is ""'heard' both by itself (and therefore not heard) and by an audience that reads the poem and 'hears' it differently"". Bennett implies that the word ""wrung"" in line one contains a double entendre as it also alludes to the ""ringing in the ears"" involved with active listening. The poem's treatment of the reader as a third-party to the conversation between the narrator and the goddess exemplifies the narrative question common among many of Keats's odes and leads Bennett to question how exactly the reader should regard his place within the poem, or outside of it. Critical reception. Responding to the poem, Keats's friend Leigh Hunt declared that ""When Mr Keats errs in his poetry, it is from the ill management of the good things,--exuberance of ideas. Once or twice, he does so in a taste positively bad, like Marino or Cowley, as in a line in his 'Ode to Psyche'... but it is once or twice only, in his present volume."" Robert Bridges, turn of the 19th-century literary critic, wrote ""for the sake of the last section (l. 50 to end), tho' this is open to the objection that the imagery is work'd up to outface the idea—which is characteristic of Keats' manner. Yet the extreme beauty quenches every dissatisfaction. The beginning of this ode is not so good, and the middle part is midway in excellence."" Later, T. S. Eliot thought very highly of Keats's work and wrote ""The Odes—especially perhaps the ""Ode to Psyche""—are enough for his reputation.""  Kennet Allott, in defending against any possible harsh criticism of ""Ode to Psyche"", argues that the poem ""is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, but it is hard to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved"". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem ""is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically."" Walter Jackson Bate states that the poem has ""always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we discover they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration."" However, he also states that ""The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics to suggest that the poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes."" To Harold Bloom, the last lines of Keats's ode ""rivals any as an epitome of the myth-making faculty"". He elaborates further on this when he writes, ""The poem ""Ode to Psyche"" is unique, and also central, for its art is a natural growth out of nature, based as it is upon a very particular act of consciousness, which Keats arrests in all its concreteness.""

wikipedia-2291620," Picasso's Rose Period  The Rose Period comes from the time when the style of Pablo Picasso's painting used cheerful orange and pink colours in contrast to the cool, somber tones of the previous Blue Period. The Rose Period lasted from 1904 to 1906. Picasso was happy in his relationship with Fernande Olivier whom he had met in 1904 and this has been suggested as one of the possible reasons he changed his style of painting. Harlequins, circus performers and clowns appear frequently in the Rose Period and populated Picasso's paintings at various stages throughout the rest of his long career. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. The Rose Period has been considered French influenced, while the Blue Period more Spanish influenced, although both styles emerged while Picasso was living in Paris. Picasso's Blue Period lasted from late 1901, following the death of his friend Carlos Casagemas, and the onset of a bout of major depression. It lasted until 1904, when Picasso's psychological condition improved. The Rose Period is named after Picasso's heavy use of pink tones in his works from this period, from the French word for pink, which is ""rose"". Picasso's highest selling painting, ""Garçon à la pipe (Boy with a pipe)"" was painted during the Rose Period. Other significant Rose Period works include: ""Woman in a Chemise (Madeleine)"" (1904–05), ""The Actor"" (1904–1905), ""Lady with a Fan"" (1905), ""Two Youths"" (1905), ""Harlequin Family"" (1905), ""Harlequin's Family With an Ape"" (1905), ""La famille de saltimbanques"" (1905), ""Boy with a Dog"" (1905), ""Nude Boy"" (1906), ""Boy Leading a Horse"" (1906), and ""The Girl with a Goat"" (1906).  The Rose Period was followed by Picasso's somewhat lesser known African influenced period, where his cubism took form. The most famous painting from Picasso's African Period is Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, painted in 1907, which created a sensation among critics and the public when it was exhibited in 1916. "
wikipedia-2291627," Densha Otoko  The event, and the man's subsequent dates with the woman, who became known as , was chronicled on the Japanese mega-BBS 2channel. This led to the compilation of the relevant threads in a book, followed by several manga versions, a movie, a theatrical play later released as a DVD, and finally a TV series. ""Densha Otoko"" is a popular example of the ""nice guy"" class of Japanese geeks who wish to lead normal lives, but are too shy to find a girlfriend, or speak openly only online. The television series uses a large number of computer-bound extras. Story. On March 14, 2004, at 9:55 p.m., an anonymous user posted in a 2channel thread for single men to talk about their woes. According to his account, he had been sitting next to a young woman on the train when a drunken man entered the car and began bothering the other passengers, most of whom were female. When the drunk began to badger a particular woman, the poster took the risk of telling the man to stop bothering the passengers. The two struggled for a short time while the other passengers used this distraction to summon the conductor, who took control of the situation. Never having done such a thing in his life, the poster was amazed to find the woman thanking him deeply for saving her from harassment. The young woman requested his address, telling him that she wanted to express her appreciation for his act, before they parted ways. The poster, upon returning home, shared his experience with other posters in the thread and was eventually nicknamed ""Densha Otoko"" (Train_Man). A few days later, Train_Man received a package from the woman: an expensive set of cups and saucers made by Hermès, a French luxury goods company. Flabbergasted, the man turned to the 2channelers for advice; he was soon convinced that the tea set was too expensive to be a mere thank-you gift. Following the advice and suggestions of the other posters, Train_Man eventually contacted the woman. The man who wrote admitted things about himself, such as the fact that his number of years without girlfriends equalled his age, that he was an Akihabara nerd and an otaku, and that he had never been on a date. Because of this last fact, he consistently posted updates on his situation, asking for advice on everything from restaurant choices to what clothing to wear. After an enjoyable first date, they began meeting regularly. Following the 2channelers' collective advice, he got a haircut, updated his wardrobe, and began to emerge from his shell. After several dates, his demeanor had changed for the better and this culminated a few months later in his confessing his love for her. She reciprocated, and when the 2channelers were informed, there was a mass celebration; posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple, and extravagant Shift JIS art pictures were posted. Train_Man's posts continued for a while longer, but on May 17, there were posts about the couple being on the verge of having sex, and several forum members made inappropriate comments on the subject. Later that night, Train_Man left the boards for good. Authenticity. While many attest to the truth of the story—including the producers of the television series, who supposedly contacted the real Train_Man—it has not been proven that the story was completely authentic. The true identity of ""Train_Man"" is never revealed and the book is based on an edited collection of posts on the 2channel bulletin board. The original conversation lasted fifty-seven days and contained 29,862 posts, whereas the book contains 1,919 posts, as collected on a fan website. A list of inconsistencies in the story has been collated, including Train_Man being too young to have a university degree and be in the workforce for three years. Production. The initial setting of the film is in Akihabara, Tokyo. Mark Schilling of ""The Japan Times"" comments that ""since Fuji TV intends ""Densha Otoko"" for prime-time broadcast, Hermess (Nakatani) can only suggest a big sisterly friendliness and affection, meaning that the sexual chemistry between her and Train Man (Yamada) is zero"". Pop Culture Shock's Erin Finnegan reported, ""when asked if the original novel would ever be imported, manga industry reps at New York Comic Con lamented that 2chan's version of l33t is nearly impossible to translate."" The fansite compiling the posts which became the book has been translated into other languages by fans of the story, including into English in 2006. President and CEO for Viz Pictures, Seiji Horibuchi, comments that the film ""Train Man: Densha Otoko"" ""will make people think fondly about their own first experiences with love and the thrill and rush it caused. Perhaps it will even inspire a few to take a chance on someone they like!""  Media. Book.

According to by Kenji Andō, only 6.4% of the sentences published in the special Densha Otoko book were left alone. The author of the book used the name . This name is a pun on the Japanese term ""Naka no hitori"", a term that refers to all the people who are part of message boards on the Internet.

""The Japan Times""' Janet Ashby commented that the book felt like an ""otaku wish-fulfillment fantasy: Someday I will magically meet Miss Right, rescue her like a knight on a white horse, be transformed into Mr. Right, and we will live happily ever after. The reaction of Miss Hermes when Trainman belatedly shows her the log of his postings about their private affairs was particularly unbelievable to me. Far from being hurt or angry, she is impressed by what good friends he has!"" Mania.com's Matthew Alexander commends ""Densha Otoko: The Story of a Train Man Who Fell in Love With A Girl"" for being realistic, saying, ""right after [Train's] session with a hair stylist, his hair is standing up in the right spots and looks good. Then, just like in real life, a couple of days afterwards his hair is back to looking like a shorter version of his hairstyle before it got cut. A very small part of the story I know, but I really appreciated the effort at displaying realism."" Coolstreak Comics' Leroy Douresseaux comments on ""Densha Otoko: The Story of a Train Man Who Fell in Love With A Girl"", saying, ""Watanabe understands the visual metaphor of the comics medium, which allows him to deliver his story with a force that captures the quiet awkwardness of two shy people"". IGN's A.E. Sparrow comments on the artwork of ""Densha Otoko: Train Man"" saying, ""Hidenori Hara brings an old school style to his illustration, and there are moments where the complex panel layouts (particularly when several online people are offering advice at once) recall some of Will Eisner's best work."" A later review by Sparrow comments that Hidenori Hara's ""work seems the most cartoonish of the bunch, with some of the characters looking almost like afterthoughts, but it's that scribbling style that really sets this version of the story apart."" He also comments on Hermess looking ""like a slightly more pixie-ish version of Lisa Hayes from Robotech"". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos' review of ""Train Man: A Shōjo Manga"" commends it for its ""unique character viewpoint and a sweet, lighthearted mood"". However, he criticises it for ""skimping on plot and character development; sometimes awkward with Internet humor."" On October 25, 2005, Japanese television drama, ""Densha Otoko"" was awarded six prizes at the 46th Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Drama, Best Supporting Actor (Atsushi Itō), Best Supporting Actress (Miho Shiraishi), Best Director (Takeuchi Hideki), Best Musical Arrangement and Best Opening. ""Densha Otoko"" movie was ranked 14th in the top movies in Japan in 2005, staying on in the box office's top 10 movies for 10 weeks, grossing ¥3,532,525,613 as of January 2006. It grossed over $35 million since its release. Metacritic gave ""Densha Otoko"" an aggregated score of 60%. Pop Culture Shock's Erin Finnegan comments on the ""Densha Otoko"" movie about its Shift JIS art (Japanese ASCII art), which made the ""strange transition from computer monitor to silver screen"". She continues, ""you might be familiar with emoticons in English internet-speak, but the Japanese use totally different emoticons. Thankfully, these symbols are clarified in the film. The bowing man art is usefully overlaid with an image of Densha Otoko bowing."" Manga Life's Michael Aronson criticises the film, saying, ""It's understood that he lacks all social grace when he trips and falls in the train in the beginning, but he does so over and over throughout the film. Furthermore, the length could easily be cut by twenty minutes if Train Man could keep from stammering all the time and actually spit out a word or two. His inadequacies translate into a crippling experience for the audience who just wants to see him get the girl and call it a day. Lastly, the characterization of the girl is so bare-bones that it's bewildering why she would be attracted to him at all."" ""San Francisco Chronicle""′s G. Allen Johnson comments that ""Train Man"" ""fable ups the ante on depicting modern communication"". He also comments on the chat-room messages, saying ""chat-room messages are texted right onto the screen, sometimes narrated in voiceover, with such frequency that a real person saying something in his real voice to another real person can be startling"". ""The New York Times""′ Jeannette Catsoulis comments on ""Train Man: Densha Otoko"", saying, ""though its appeal may be limited to the socially awkward, the movie is unusually perceptive about the attractions of online communities while gently insisting on the superiority of flesh over fantasy. ""Train Man"" wants us to get off our computers and get out of the house; in a country as technocentric as Japan, the suggestion that it may be time to replace the cyber with the real is not just subversive, it's downright revolutionary."" ""The Village Voice""'s Drew Tillman criticises the film for its ""annoying split screens"" when ""Man turns to his chat room buddies for advice on how to win over"". ""TV Guide""′s Maitland McDonagh criticises the film for its ending that ""drags on, and the fantasy sequences are bluntly obvious (though Train Man's nightmare vision of meeting Hermes' parents is pretty funny)"". However, she commends the fairy-tale romance [that is grounded in authentic detail. "
wikipedia-2291636," Ari Up  Ariane Daniela Forster (17 January 1962 – 20 October 2010), known by her stage name Ari Up, was a German-born vocalist best known as a member of the English punk group, The Slits. Career. Ariane Daniele Forster was born in Munich, Germany, Her mother, Nora, was known in the music industry, as she was a friend of Jimi Hendrix and dated Chris Spedding for three years. Ari's grandfather was a wealthy German newspaper proprietor and her godfather was Jon Anderson, the singer of the group Yes.  Nora would later date and marry the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon. Their home was known to be something of a punk domain, where Nora would take in poor musicians. The constant presence of punk music led to Ari Up experimenting in it herself, learning guitar skills from The Clash's Joe Strummer. Ari Up was fourteen years old when she formed The Slits with drummer Palmolive in 1976, herself in possession of 'posh piano lessons and a good ear'. Within a short time, guitarist Viv Albertine joined the group and found herself deeply impressed by the young singer. ""English was her second language,"" Albertine noted in an interview. ""It was not easy for her and she had to fight to be taken seriously."" She succeeded: ""Ari was the most dynamic woman I have ever known,"" said Albertine. ""The way she carried herself was a revolution."" By the late 1970s, the Slits were touring as the opening act for the Clash. Ari Up's love of reggae led the Slits into a ""jungly"", dub style. She was the most flamboyant member of the group. Her wild hair and crazy stage outfits became her trademarks. She can be seen briefly in the Clash movie, ""Rude Boy"", with the band backstage. Her 1977 performances with the Slits are featured in ""The Punk Rock Movie"", a 1992 release of various punk group club performances, principally at The Roxy.

wikipedia-2291645," 1968 Polish political crisis  The Polish 1968 political crisis, also known in Poland as March 1968 or March events () pertains to the major student and intellectual protest action against the government of the People's Republic of Poland. The crisis resulted in the suppression of student strikes by security forces in all major academic centres across the country and the subsequent repression of the Polish dissident movement. It was also accompanied by a mass emigration following the antisemitic ""anti-Zionist"" campaign waged by the Minister of Interior, Gen. Mieczysław Moczar, with the approval of the Communist Party General Secretary Władysław Gomułka. The protests coincided with the events of Prague spring in neighboring Czechoslovakia – raising new hopes of democratic reforms among the intelligentsia – and culminated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on 20 August 1968. The government's anti-Jewish campaign already began in 1967. It was a policy carried out in conjunction with the Soviet withdrawal of all diplomatic relations with Israel after the Six Day War – with factory workers across Poland forced to publicly denounce Zionism - and also involved a power struggle within the Communist party itself. The subsequent purges within the communist party, led by Mieczysław Moczar and his faction, failed to topple Gomułka's government, but resulted in an actual expulsion from Poland of thousands of individuals of Jewish ancestry, including professionals, party officials and the secret police functionaries blamed ""for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period."" Before the end of 1971, 12,927 Poles of Jewish origin emigrated.  Background. Protest in 1968 Europe. Political turmoil of the late 1960s – exemplified in the West by increasingly violent protests against the Vietnam war – were reflected in the East by the events of the Prague spring which began on 5 January 1968. A growing wave of protests in Czechoslovakia marked the highpoint of a broader series of dissident social mobilization. The protests of the workers within the communist framework seemed to recall the 1956 protests in Poland. Numerous events of protest and revolt, especially among students reverberated across the continent in 1968, but many followed rather than preceded the Polish crisis. A growing crisis of communist party control over universities, the literary community, and intellectuals more generally, marked the mid-1960s. Among those persecuted for their political activism on campus were Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik. Polish student and intellectual protest. At the end of January 1968, on behalf of the communist government, Zenon Kliszko banned the performance of a play by Adam Mickiewicz, (""Dziady"", written in 1824), directed by Kazimierz Dejmek at the Polish Theatre in Warsaw, on the grounds that it contained Russophobic and ""anti-socialist"" references. The play had been performed 14 times, the last time on January 30. Dejmek was expelled from the Communist Party and later fired from the National Theatre. – He returned to his job in Warsaw as an artistic director only 5 years later. The Warsaw Writers' Union condemned the ban on March 2, followed by the Actors' Union. A crowd of some 1,500 students protesting at Warsaw University on March 8 was met by attacks by the riot police. Within four days, protests spread to Kraków, Lublin, Gliwice, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, and Łódź. Bands of Communist party ""worker-squads"" from ORMO (Volunteer Reserve Militia) attacked the students at the university halls, followed by police in Warsaw and Lublin. Mass student strikes took place in Wrocław on March 14–16, Kraków on March 14–20, and Opole. A call for a general strike was issued from Warsaw on March 13. A hardline speech by Władysław Gomułka on March 19 cut off the possibility of negotiation. Further student protests, strikes and occupations were met with the mass academic expulsion of thousands of participants. National coordination by the students was attempted through a March 25 meeting in Wrocław; most of its attendees were jailed by the end of April. At least 2,725 people were arrested for participating. According to internal government reports, the suppression was generally effective, although students were able to disrupt the May Day ceremonies in Wrocław later in the year. The success of the ORMO attack on universities in the wake of growing citizen discontent (see Polish 1970 protests) prompted the Ministry of Public Security to began massive expansion of its rank and file. Political purges. The Soviet Union withdrew all diplomatic relations with Israel on 10 June 1967 following the Six Day War, and quickly rebuilt the Arab forces. Leonid Brezhnev demanded condemnation of Israel from Gomułka at their joint meeting in Moscow. After his return to Warsaw, on June 19, 1967 Gomułka proclaimed at the Trade Union Congress, that the Israel's aggression had been ""met with applause in Zionist circles of Jews – Polish citizens."" His new ""anti-Zionist"" campaign was taken over by General Moczar from MSW (born Nikola Demko). The communist party appointed Tadeusz Walichnowski, an ""anti-Zionist expert,"" the head of the minorities branch of the government, and by moving that department from social services to counter-intelligence. In the words of Polish scholar Włodzimierz Rozenbaum, the Six Day War: ""provided Gomułka with an opportunity 'to kill several birds with one stone': he could use an ""anti-Zionist"" policy to undercut the appeal of the liberal wing of the PUWP; he could bring forward the Jewish issue to weaken the support for the nationalist faction and make his own position even stronger..."" while securing political prospects for his own supporters. The government-sponsored campaign of anti-Israel and anti-Zionist propaganda maintained – after the Prime Minister's speech – that there is a risk of ""a fifth column to emerge in our country"" thus suggesting that the ""hidden Zionists"" should relocate to Israel. The Communist party began a process of purging Jewish officials, primarily the moral supporters of the liberal opposition movement. Many Poles (irrespective of actual faith) were accused of being Zionists and expelled from the party. In order to stir the attention of general public away from the Student movement and calls for social reform, which had a liberal background and was centred around freedom of speech for intellectuals and artists, the communist party came up with the idea of Nazi provenance. A leader of a hardline Stalinist faction within the Communist Party, Mieczysław Moczar, blamed the student protests on ""Zionists"" and used this affair as a pretext to launch a larger antisemitic campaign (although the expression ""anti-Zionist"" was officially used) to target Jews. In fact, despite the participation of a mix of Christian and Jewish Polish student activists in the protests, the relation of the protesting to Zionism was mixed if not negative. The national strike call from Warsaw opposed both antisemitism and Zionism. A banner hung at a Rzeszow high school on April 27 read: ""We hail our Zionist comrades."" However, Gomulka warned that ""Zionism and anti-Semitism are two sides of the same nationalist medal"", and that Communism rejects all forms of nationalism. Gomulka rejected the allegations of anti-Semitism, saying, ""Official circles in the United States had involved themselves in the dirty anti-Polish campaign by making statements accusing Poland of anti-Semitism. We propose that the ruling circles in the United States check whether American citizens of Polish descent have ever had or now have the same opportunities that Polish citizens of Jewish descent have for living conditions and education and for occupying responsible positions. Then it would clearly emerge who might accuse whom of national discrimination."" Gomulka went on saying that ""Western Zionist centers that today charge us with anti-Semitism failed to lift a finger when Hitler's genocide was exterminating Jews in subjugated Poland punishing with death Poles who hid and helped the Jews.""  Emigration of Polish citizens of Jewish origin. Historian David Engel of YIVO Institute wrote: ""The Interior Ministry compiled a card index of all Polish citizens of Jewish origin, even those who had been detached from organized Jewish life for generations. Jews were removed from jobs in public service, including from teaching positions in schools and universities. Pressure was placed upon them to leave the country by bureaucratic actions aimed at undermining their sources of livelihood and sometimes even by physical brutality."" According to Dariusz Stola of the Polish Academy of Sciences ""the term 'anti-Zionist campaign' is misleading in two ways, since the campaign began as an anti-Israeli policy but quickly turned into an anti-Jewish campaign, and this evident anti-Jewish character remained its distinctive feature"". The propaganda equated Jewish origins with Zionist sympathies and thus disloyalty to communist Poland. Antisemitic slogans were used in rallies. Prominent Jews: academics, managers, journalists lost their jobs. According to the Institute of National Remembrance, ""in each case – wrote the decision of dismissal was proceeded by a Party resolution about expelling from the Party"". Most Polish Jews who claimed their official status at the end of World War II, including Holocaust survivors who registered at CKŻP in 1945, had emigrated from Stalinist Poland already in her first years of existence. Of the fewer than 80,000 Jews who remained, many had political reasons for doing so. Consequently – as noted by historian Michael C. Steinlauf – ""their group profile ever more closely resembled the mythic Żydokomuna."" Many Jews held positions of repressive authority under the new administration. In March 1968 they became the center of an organized campaign to equate Jewish origins with Stalinist sympathies. The political purges affected all Polish Jews regardless of background, even though they were being ostensibly directed at those who had held office during the Stalinist era marked by gross abuse of power and human rights law violations. Over a thousand former hardline Stalinists left Poland in 1968, among them ex prosecutor Helena Wolińska-Brus and Stalinist judge Stefan Michnik. The ""Polish State Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation"" (Institute of National Remembrance, IPN) had investigated Stalinist crimes committed by some of the March 1968 emigrants including Michnik who settled in Sweden, and Wolińska-Brus residing in the United Kingdom. Both were accused of being an ""accessory to a court murder"" which is punishable by up to ten years in prison, as defined by the Article 2.1 of the Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland issued 18 December 1998. As soon as Poland joined the European Union, applications were made for their extradition based on European Arrest Warrants (EAW). However, Polish requests were refused on humanitarian grounds under the statute of limitations. Between 1961 and 1967 the average rate of Jewish emigration from Poland was 500–900 persons per year. In 1968 the total of 3,900 Jews submitted their applications for leaving the country. A year later, between January and August 1969, the number of emigrating Jews was almost 7,300 according to records of the Ministry of Interior Affairs. Aftermath. One of the reactions of the communist government of Poland to the protests, was a greater support for demonstrations of Polish national feelings. Another consequence was the alienation of the regime from the leftist intelligentsia, who were disgusted at the official promotion of antisemitism. Many Polish intellectuals opposed the campaign, many openly. Another effect was the founding by Polish Emigrants to the West of organizations that encouraged opposition within Poland. Inside Poland the alienation of the leftist intelligentsia had a long afterlife, and eventually contributed to the downfall of the PZPR dictatorship. Jacek Kuroń, twice a PZPR member and imprisoned for his role in the events, in particular, became a highly effective adviser of the independent workers' movement in Poland. More generally the events - preceded by those in 1956 and followed by 1970, 1976 and then 1980, showed that Poland, with its strong nationalist traditions and a civil society, especially the Church, that had never been fully repressed, was the weakest element in the ""Eastern Bloc"". The antisemitic campaign damaged Poland's reputation abroad, particularly in the United States. Despite worldwide condemnation of the March 1968 events, for many years the Communist government did not admit the antisemitic nature of the anti-Zionist campaign, though some newspapers were allowed to publish critical articles. Finally, in 1988, the Polish Communist government officially acknowledged that the events were antisemitic, although they avoided taking full responsibility, calling them ""political mistakes"". After the fall of the Communist government, the Sejm issued an official condemnation of the antisemitism of the March 1968 events in 1998. In 2000, President Aleksander Kwaśniewski gave his own apology for the event in front of a group of Jewish students ""as the president of Poland and as a Pole."" On the 30th anniversary of their departures a memorial plaque was placed at Warszawa Gdańska train station, from which most of exiled people took a train to Vienna. "
wikipedia-2291655," We'll Meet Again  ""We'll Meet Again"" is a 1939 song made famous by British singer Vera Lynn with music and lyrics composed and written by Ross Parker (born Albert Rostron Parker, 16 August 1914 in Manchester) & Hugh Charles (born Charles Hugh Owen Ferry, 24 July 1907 in Reddish, Stockport, Cheshire).  The song is one of the most famous songs of the Second World War era, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight and their families and sweethearts. The assertion that ""we'll meet again"" is optimistic, as many soldiers did not survive to see their loved ones again. Indeed, the meeting place at some unspecified time in the future would have been seen by many who lost loved ones to be heaven. The song gave its name to the 1943 musical film ""We'll Meet Again"" in which Vera Lynn played the lead role (""see"" 1943 in music). Lynn's recording is featured in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film ""Dr. Strangelove"", and was also used in the closing scenes of the 1986 BBC television serial ""The Singing Detective"". British director John Schlesinger used the song in his 1979 WWII film, ""Yanks"", which is about British citizens and American soldiers during the military buildup in the U.K. as the Allies prepared for the D-Day Invasion. During the Cold War, Vera Lynn's recording was included in the package of music and programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack. Mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins reprised the song at her appearance alongside Lynn in London on the 60th Anniversary of VE Day in 2005, and has retained it as an occasional item in her repertoire. "
wikipedia-2291656," Go to Sleep  ""Go to Sleep"" is a song by the English rock band Radiohead, released as the second single from their sixth album ""Hail to the Thief"" in 2003. The alternate title for the song as listed on the track listing for the album is ""Little Man Being Erased"". A number twelve hit in the UK, it also reached number thirty-nine on the Australian ARIA Charts. Musical structure. ""Go to Sleep"" starts in 10/4 (4/4 + 6/4) with an acoustic guitar riff written by Ed O'Brien but played by Thom Yorke. After 11 bars of guitar and vocals, the rest of the band comes in. In the second half of the song the time signature remains in 4/4 and the guitars change to a different riff; the song fades out with a guitar solo played by Jonny Greenwood. The guitar-work at the end of this track was achieved by Jonny Greenwood playing a sequence of random notes on his guitar that were being processed through a digital patch for software called Max/MSP, which is musical software frequently used by electronica or experimental artists. A similar solo to that heard in live versions of ""Go to Sleep"" was played by Adrian Belew on the 1980 Talking Heads song ""Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On),"" though it was generated through different technology. Radiohead have cited the album ""Remain in Light"" on which the song appears as a major inspiration on their work in general. Music video. Directed by Alex Rutterford, the CGI-animated video shows a full-blossom red rose swaying in the wind, and proceeds to show Yorke sitting on a park bench singing the song while around him men and women in business suits walk by rapidly. In the middle of the video, the buildings, in classical architecture style, spontaneously crumble into pieces and moments later reassemble themselves, only to have become modern in style. The shot returns to the rose shown in the beginning, which is now closed in a bud. Track listings. The b-sides for the single are ""Gagging Order"" and ""I Am a Wicked Child."" The former is a solo acoustic guitar song. ""I Am a Wicked Child"" is a blues song with harmonica work by Jonny Greenwood. "

wikipedia-2291681," Elfego Baca  Elfego Baca (February 10, 1865 – August 27, 1945) was a gunman, lawman, lawyer, and politician in the closing days of the American wild west. Baca was born in Socorro, New Mexico just before the end of the American Civil War to Francisco and Juana Maria Baca. His family moved to Topeka, Kansas when he was a young child. Upon his mother’s death in 1880, Baca returned with his father to Belen, New Mexico where his father became a marshal. In 1884, at age 19, Baca acquired some guns, and became a deputy sheriff in (through purchasing a badge or by being appointed is unclear) Socorro County, New Mexico. His goal in life was to be a peace officer. He wanted, he said, “the outlaws to hear my steps a block away.” Southwestern New Mexico at the time was still relatively sparsely settled cattle ranching country. Cowboys roamed the land and did as they pleased. They might come into a town, drink at the saloon, harass the locals, and then shoot up the town out of boredom. Baca meant to put an end to that. The Frisco Shootout. In October, 1884, in the town of Lower San Francisco Plaza (now Reserve, New Mexico), Elfego Baca arrested a drunk cowboy named Charlie McCarty. Baca flashed his badge at McCarty and took Charlie's gun.  McCarty's fellow cowboys tried to take him by force, but Baca refused and opened fire on the cowboys, killing the horse of one, which fell on his rider killing him. Baca shot another Cowboy in the knee. Justice of the peace Ted White granted Charlie's freedom. After the verdict, Elfego Baca ran out of the courtroom still in possession of McCarty's gun. Baca took refuge in the house of Geronimo Armijo. Bert Hearne, a rancher from Spur Lake Ranch, was summoned to bring Baca back to the Justice for questioning in the murder of Jon Slaughter's foreman. After Baca refused to come out of the adobe jacal, Hearne broke down the door and ordered Baca to come out with his hands up. Soon after that, shots volleyed from the jacal and hit Hearne in the stomach, resulting in his death. A standoff with the cowboys ensued. The number of cowboys that gathered has been disputed, with villagers at the scene reporting about forty were present, while Elfego himself later claiming there had been at least eighty. Allegedly, the cowboys fired more than 4,000 shots into the house, until the adobe building was full of holes. Incredibly, not one of the bullets struck Baca. (The floor of the home is said to have been slightly lower than ground level; thus Baca was able to escape injury.) During the siege, Baca shot and killed four of his attackers and wounded eight others. After about 33 hours, and roughly 1,000 rounds of open fire, the battle ended when Francisquito Naranjo convinced Baca to surrender.  In May 1885, Baca was charged with murder for the death of Jon Slaughter's foreman and Bert Hearne. He was jailed to await his trial. In August 1885, Baca was acquitted after the door of Armijo’s house was entered as evidence. It had more than 400 bullet holes in it. The incident became known as the Frisco Shootout. Rumor has it that Elfego Baca's defense attorney had false documentation proving Baca's legal deputization because Baca's biography suggests he deputized himself just before the arrest of Charlie McCarty. Law and Order. Baca officially became the sheriff of Socorro County and secured indictments for the arrest of the area's lawbreakers. Instead of ordering his deputies to pursue the wanted men, he sent each of the accused a letter. It said, ""I have a warrant here for your arrest. Please come in by March 15 and give yourself up. If you don’t, I’ll know you intend to resist arrest, and I will feel justified in shooting you on sight when I come after you."" Most of the offenders turned themselves in voluntarily. In 1888, Baca became a U.S. Marshal. He served for two years and then began studying law. In December 1894, he was admitted to the bar and joined a Socorro law firm. He practiced law on San Antonio Street in El Paso between 1902 and 1904. Political life. Baca held a succession of public offices, including county clerk, mayor and school superintendent of Socorro County, and district attorney for Socorro and Sierra Counties. In his book ""The Shooters"", Leon Metz writes that “most reports say he was the best peace officer Socorro ever had.” From 1913 to 1916, Baca served as the official representative in the U.S. of Victoriano Huerta's government during the Mexican Revolution. In April 1915, Baca was charged with criminal conspiracy for allegedly masterminding the November 1914 escape of Mexican general José Inés Salazar escaped from the Albuquerque jail. Successfully defended by the New Mexican lawyer and politician Octaviano Larrazolo, Baca's reputation grew among Southwestern residents. When New Mexico became a state in 1912, Baca unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Republican. Nevertheless, he remained a valued political figure because of his ability to turn out the vote among the Hispanic population. Working at times as a private detective, Baca also took a job as a bouncer in a casino across the border in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Baca worked closely with New Mexico’s longtime Senator Bronson Cutting as a political investigator and wrote a weekly column in Spanish praising Cutting’s work on behalf of local Hispanics. Baca considered running for governor despite his declining health, but he failed to secure the Democratic Party’s nomination for district attorney in 1944. Metz, his biographer, wrote: “Elfego was, and is, controversial. He drank too much; talked too much ... he had a weakness for wild women. He was often arrogant and, of course, he showed no compunction about killing people.” On his 75th birthday, Baca told the ""Albuquerque Tribune"" that as a lawyer he had defended 30 people charged with murder, and only one went to the penitentiary. In July 1936, several years before his death, Janet Smith conducted an interview with Elfego Baca. Her notes can be found in the Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, WPA Federal Writers’ Project Collection. Baca told Smith, “I never wanted to kill anybody, but if a man had it in his mind to kill me, I made it my business to get him first.” Legends. Another legend says that Baca stole a pistol from Pancho Villa, and the angry Villa put a price of $30,000 on Baca’s head. Obviously, it was never collected. One often told story says that once when he was practicing law in Albuquerque, Baca received a telegram from a client in El Paso, Texas. ""Need you at once,"" it said, ""Have just been charged with murder."" To which Baca is supposed to have responded with a telegram saying, ""Leaving at once with three eyewitnesses."" Walt Disney television series. In 1958, Walt Disney Studios released a television miniseries entitled ""The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca"" and starring Robert Loggia in the title role. Significant is the care Disney took to depict the famous siege in as authentic a manner as possible, given the known details. Among those who appeared in the series were Skip Homeier, Raymond Bailey, and I. Stanford Jolley. Episodes of the series were later edited into a movie titled ""Elfego Baca: Six Gun Law"", which was released in 1962. The theme song's tag line was, ""And the legend was that / Like ""el gato"", ""the cat"" / Nine lives had Elfego Baca."" "
wikipedia-2291733," Canyon del Oro High School  Canyon del Oro High School, also known as CDO, is a comprehensive public high school in Oro Valley, Arizona, located north of Tucson at the base of Pusch Ridge. Established as a high school in 1964, CDO is one of three high schools of Amphitheater Public Schools and serves about 1,600 students in grades 9–12. The school name originates from the remote Canyon del Oro (Spanish for ""Canyon of Gold"") in the nearby Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The school mascot is the Dorado (from the Legend of El Dorado), a mythical Latin American warrior, and the school colors are forest green and gold. The Dorado mascot was originally designed by former art teacher Diane Redhair in the mid-1960s. CDO is primarily known for its academic program and the notable number of Major League Baseball players the school has produced in recent decades. CDO is statistically one of the highest achieving schools in Arizona, both academically and athletically. In 2007, 2010, and again in 2011, ""Newsweek Magazine"" rated CDO in the top 5% of public schools in the U.S., one of a handful of schools in Arizona included on the list. In 2011, ""Newsweek"" ranked CDO number 408 on its list of the best public schools in the U.S. (top 1.5% nationally). From 2005 to the present, CDO has consistently been academically classified as ""Excelling"" by the Arizona Department of Education (top 10 percent in Arizona). Between 2000 and 2010, CDO has graduated 42 National Merit Scholarship Semifinalists. CDO is also home to the 2011 Arizona Academic Decathlon State Champions, with the team finishing 5th in the National Academic Decathlon competition. The team placed as State Champion in 2009, finishing 4th in the National Academic Decathlon, State Runner-Up in 2007, 2008, and 2010, and was State Champion in 2006, finishing 5th in the National Academic Decathlon. CDO is also ranked 6th in Arizona for the most all-time state championships in 4A & 5A (large school) team sports as of 2006 (""Arizona Interscholastic Association""). History. Financing through bonds. The dramatic population growth in the Amphitheater School District during the 1950s placed increasing demands on the district's existing schools. Enrollment reached capacity at the district's sole high school, Amphitheater High School, in the late 1950s. As a result, District Superintendent Marion Donaldson developed a bond proposal in June 1959 that included the purchase of a second high school site in the district. Voters approved the $1.9 million bonds ($12.8 million in 2006) by a 4 to 1 margin. Population growth in the area north of the Rillito River and Tucson was rapidly expanding, and the original purchased for the second high school was then determined to initially serve a middle school population as well. Another bond issue was proposed for the construction of Canyon del Oro School in June 1961, with $1.4 million ($9.2 million in 2006) for the first phase of the school, and $2.3 million ($15.3 million in 2006) for expansion of the school. Voters again approved the bonds by a 3 to 1 margin (""Amphitheater"" by Peyton Reavis, 1981). Canyon del Oro Junior High School. Canyon del Oro School opened as a junior high school in the fall of 1962 with only a seventh grade class. The campus was only a few buildings with a large grass courtyard accessed by Calle Concordia, which was then only a small dirt road. Land values north of Tucson were beginning to appreciate through the 1950s, and many residents of the Amphitheater School District expressed concern that the site of the school in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains was too costly (""Amphitheater"" by Peyton Reavis, 1981). The school added a new grade level each year, and Canyon del Oro High School was established in the fall of 1964 with a ninth grade class. CDO was formally declared a high school by the State of Arizona on July 1, 1965, serving grades 9–10, with only a few hundred students. Canyon del Oro Junior High School would continue operation on the same campus as a distinct school, serving grades 7–8 until 1974, when L.W. Cross Middle School was established on a separate campus to accommodate the middle school students. Canyon del Oro High School. Construction continued on the high school campus, and CDO gained recognition as a school of privilege with state-of-the-art facilities, and drew students from the most affluent sections of the Tucson area. The campus was designed in a Modernist style by architects Bernard Friedman and Fred Jobusch (Friedman & Jobusch) to be completed in phases. Friedman & Jobusch also designed the contemporary Main Library at the University of Arizona in 1976. The Modernist style incorporated into the Canyon del Oro campus design in the early 1960s is a significant example of the Modernist movement that dominated in the U.S. following World War II. The Canyon del Oro campus represents a shift in 20th-century American architecture when Modernism was favored over traditional styles in an effort to project American progress. The gymnasium at the school featured a four-sided score board suspended above the basketball court (""Amphitheater"" by Peyton Reavis, 1981). The CDO campus expanded with the gradual population increase north of Tucson, and the first graduating class was in the summer of 1968. New construction occurred through the late 1990s, adding technology and laboratory science facilities for chemistry, physics, and biology. A second gymnasium was completed in the 1970s, along with an expanded library, fine arts complex, and bookstore. As of 2007, the campus included 21 buildings on . Among the most notable families whose children attended CDO during the 1960s and 1970s was the Udall family. Mo Udall represented much of southern Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives at the time, and his brother Stewart Udall served as president of the Amphitheater School Board before later serving as Secretary of the Interior under U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. From the 1960s through the 1980s, CDO became a dominating presence in golf and tennis, capturing the respective state titles nearly each year. CDO also won back-to-back state championships in both basketball and football in the late 1970s. The CDO girl's basketball team registered an undefeated 28–0 record in 1987, capturing the 5A State title (""Arizona Interscholastic Association""). Substantial growth. As the Oro Valley area experienced significant population growth in the 1990s, enrollment at CDO increased as well. At its enrollment peak, CDO served a student population of nearly 3,100 in 2001. CDO had the highest enrollment of any high school in southern Arizona, and was one of the largest schools in the state. The growth and desirability of Oro Valley (the fastest growing municipality in Arizona for several years in the 1990s), was often credited by the media to CDO and the strong educational reputation the school established (""Arizona Daily Star""). In 2001, CDO received relief as the Amphitheater School District opened Ironwood Ridge, the district's third high school, in northwestern Oro Valley. Current state of the school. Canyon del Oro continues to register among the highest standardized test scores in Arizona, and a notable number of National Merit Scholars. CDO is one of the few high schools consistently designated as ""Excelling"" (the highest academic distinction) by the Arizona Department of Education. Canyon del Oro High School will celebrate its 50th anniversary of establishment in the fall of 2014. Academics. Throughout CDO's history, the school has continually ranked among the top high schools in Arizona in standardized test administrations and academic performance evaluations by the Arizona Department of Education. As a comprehensive institution, the course selection at CDO is extensive. The school offers 17 Advanced Placement courses, among the widest variety available.  CDO offers: Over 90% of the school's graduates seek post-secondary education. Half (49.5%) of CDO faculty have attained a Master's degree or a PhD. As for faculty recognition, Librarian Beth Malapanes was selected Circle K/UA Athletics/KOLD Teacher of the Year for the Tucson area in 2007. In 2006, family and consumer sciences teacher Patti Schmalzel was also selected Circle K/UA Athletics/KOLD Teacher of the Year for the Tucson area. Further, mathematics teacher Chris Yetman was named an ""Ambassador for Excellence"" by the Arizona Educational Foundation as a top 5 finalist for Arizona Teacher of the Year in 2005. Canyon del Oro is under accreditation by the North Central Association. CDO has graduated among the highest number of National Merit Scholars in Arizona. Scholars have been represented in every graduating class since the school's first class in 1968, with the exception of two years (2000 & 2002). In 2006 alone, the school had seven National Merit Finalists. The school has also promoted several Flinn Scholars of the Flinn Foundation, the highest scholastic honor in Arizona, into the state's institutions of higher learning. Achievement rates on Advanced Placement exams, particularly in the laboratory sciences and mathematics, have historically far exceeded the national average. The school's journalism department has been recognized by the Interscholastic Press Association for outstanding work by the school newspaper, ""The Palantir"", and the yearbook, ""Años de Oro"". Since the school opened in the 1960s, CDO has also had a notable history in chess, with teams continually ranked nationally. IB Programme. In the 2012-13 school year, CDO began offering the IB Diploma Programme to its notable and gifted students. CDO is now a full-fledged IB School. Extracurricular activities. The extracurricular activities offered at CDO are numerous and varied. There are chapters of national organizations such as the National Honor Society and clubs founded by CDO students such as Science Explorer, in which students promote science through practical activities in the local community. Service organizations such as Key Club coexist alongside recreational clubs. Athletics. Competing in the 5A Division for 25 years, the school captured several hundred championship titles (region and state). Such championships include 7 state crowns in baseball (most recently a 5A title in 2002, and a 4A-I title in 2009), 8 state titles in softball (most recently a 5A title in 2005, and 4A-I titles in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012), 11 team state titles in boy's tennis, 6 team state titles in girl's tennis, 9 team state titles in boy's golf (most recently a Division II title in 2011), and 4 team state titles in girl's track and field (most recently a 4A-I title in 2011). Due to recent downsizing from the opening of a new high school, CDO presently competes in the Arizona Interscholastic Association 4A Sonoran Conference, Division I (""Arizona Interscholastic Association""). Football. After winning back-to-back state championships in 1976 and 1977, the Canyon del Oro football program experienced difficulty repeating such success. CDO began to revamp its football program in the 2000 season resulting in a 6–4 overall record in 5A play. The following year CDO recorded a 7–3 regular season, falling to perennial powerhouse Mesa Mountain View in the opening round of the 5A state playoffs. After dropping to 4A due to an enrollment decline, CDO's football program has experienced marked recent success, including several berths in the state playoffs. In 2007 CDO finished a 9–1 regular season, the sole loss to Glendale Cactus 36–34. Victories followed over Cienega High School, Prescott High School, and Peoria High School in the opening, quarterfinal, and semifinal rounds of the 4A state playoffs. CDO reached the 4A State Championship, ultimately losing to the defending State Champion, Scottsdale Saguaro High School, 23–21 after a field goal by the Sabercats with two seconds remaining in play. In 2009, CDO finished 10–0 in the regular season (Division 4A-I), including an impressive win over three-time defending State Champion Saguaro Sabercats 44–0, ending their 37-game winning streak.

CDO has won more 4A & 5A (large school) state championships than all other schools in southern Arizona, with the exception of the oldest, Tucson High School (""Arizona Interscholastic Association""). Below is a comprehensive table including all athletic state titles won by CDO teams. Canyon del Oro teams competed at the 3A equivalent level from fall 1966 to spring 1968, and the 4A equivalent level from fall 1968 to spring 1980. Between fall 1980 and spring 2005, CDO teams competed at the 5A level, resuming 4A competition from fall 2005 to 2009. The AIA reclassified class 4A-I as Division II in 2010. Academics. Academic Decathlon. Canyon del Oro is also home to one of the top performing Academic Decathlon teams in Arizona. The CDO team is a perennial powerhouse in the region, defeating other academically reputable schools in the area nearly every year. As of 2010, the team had captured nine consecutive region titles. The Arizona Academic Decathlon named mathematics teacher Chris Yetman Region III Coach of the Year in 2002. The CDO team placed 4th in the Arizona Academic Decathlon State Competition in 2002, 3rd in the state in 2003, State Runner-Up in 2004, and 3rd in the state in 2005. In 2006 the team became the Arizona Academic Decathlon State Champions, outscoring defending state champs Mesa Mountain View 46,482 points to 46,406 points. CDO represented Arizona in the National competition, placing 5th. In 2007, the team scored 45,667 points, placing second in the state behind Mesa Mountain View with 47,402 points. In 2008, the team scored 46,600 points, placing second in the state for the second consecutive year. In 2009, CDO once again became the Arizona Academic Decathlon State Champions, outscoring Mesa Red Mountain 47,055.5 points to 44,052.2 points. The CDO team placed 4th in the U.S. Academic Decathlon National Competition, in representing Arizona, with 47,972.3 points. CDO placed behind Moorpark High School of California (51,289.5 points), Waukesha West High School of Wisconsin (50,979.9 points), and Burke High School of Nebraska (48,064.0 points). In 2010, CDO placed as State Runner-Up behind Mesa Mountain View, with the team scoring 47,892.4 points. In 2011, CDO was the State Champion in Arizona, and finished 5th in the National Competition with 46,522.7 points. In 2012, CDO placed as State Runner-Up behind Mesa Mountain View, with the team scoring 44,962 points. In 2013, CDO placed as State Runner-Up behind Red Mountain. At the National Competition, the team placed 9th overall. Science Olympiad. CDO has an active and ever-increasing Science Olympiad program, which has placed well in the state tournament in years past. This program is run by students and the AP Biology teacher, Dr. Zeiher. Other science teachers are becoming involved in the success of this program, notably Mrs. Christman of the chemistry department. Students create functioning robots and helicopters, as well as utilize high-tech protein modeling programs. In 2009, the team was Rookie of the Year at the state competition. The CDO team placed second in robotics during the state competition of 2011, but students aim to surpass this in years to come. Academic Challenges. The Future Problem Solving Team won first place in the state competition in 2001. It also won second place in the state competition and sixth place in the national competition in 2006. Notable alumni. Since the school's first graduating class in 1968, over 17,000 individuals have been awarded high school diplomas from Canyon del Oro (2008). The following is a list of encyclopedic people associated with Canyon del Oro. Notable alumni include a current U.S. Senator (and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives), a head NFL referee for several Super Bowls, and a significant number of former and active Major League Baseball players, including a 2008 American League All-Star. Attendance boundaries. The attendance boundaries of Canyon del Oro encompass segments of the communities of Oro Valley, Casas Adobes, and Catalina Foothills. The northern boundary roughly follows the Cañada del Oro and East/West Lambert Lane. The eastern boundary is defined by Catalina State Park and the Coronado National Forest/Pusch Ridge Wilderness Area. The southern boundary is East/West Orange Grove Road from North Shannon Road east to North First Avenue. Between North First Avenue and the North Alvernon Road parallel, East Ina Road is the southern boundary (including the neighborhoods of Pima Canyon Estates and Cobblestone Estates). The western boundary is North Shannon Road. Feeder schools. Elementary schools in the Canyon del Oro attendance area include Marion Donaldson, Winifred Harelson, Mesa Verde, and Copper Creek. L.W. Cross Middle School is the only middle school feeding into Canyon del Oro. Enrollment history. CDO opened in the fall of 1962 with a limited enrollment of only grade 7, and by 1965 the school had a high school enrollment of 283 students (specifically grades 9–10.) In its first year as a four-year high school with grades 9–12, CDO had an enrollment of 560 students. Enrollment gradually increased, exceeding 1,000 students in 1972, 2,000 students in 1987, and 3,000 students in the fall of 2000. The largest enrollment was 3,080 in 2000 (when CDO was the 6th largest high school in Arizona), and declined to 1,700 in 2005 due to the establishment of a new high school (Ironwood Ridge High School) in the fall of 2001. Due to open enrollment, CDO has sustained enrollment above 1,800 in recent years (""Arizona Interscholastic Association""). "
wikipedia-2291771," The Succubus  ""The Succubus"" is the 34th episode of Comedy Central's animated series ""South Park"". It originally aired on April 21, 1999. Plot. Eric Cartman must go to the local eye doctor, whom he hates because the doctor always makes fun of his obesity by referring to him as ""Piggy"". Cartman is told that he has bad vision and has his eyes dilated; he is later given a pair of thick-rimmed glasses which are then stapled to his head so that he cannot take them off. Later, he and the other boys discover that Chef has quit his job at South Park Elementary and has been replaced by Mr. Derp (created by young Trey Parker), a cliché cartoon character, satirizing Pauly Shore, who tries (and fails) to win them over with his poor slapstick comedy gags.  They then find out that Chef has a new girlfriend, Veronica, played by Michael Ann Young, who has caused his life to change from that of a free-spirited, soul-singing hipster to that of a mediocre, religious paper pusher. She is also extremely fond of singing the love theme from ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""The Morning After"" at inappropriate times. The boys believe that she is trying to steal Chef away from them and are dismayed when they discover that the two are planning to get married. Not wanting Chef to go too, the boys seek advice from Mr. Garrison, who suggests that Veronica is a succubus: a demoness sent from Hell to prey on and suck the life out of men. The boys go to warn Chef of this, but instead they meet his parents, who tell them about their frequent meetings with the Loch Ness Monster, claiming that the beast is stalking and constantly pestering them for a sum of ""about tree fiddy"" ($3.50). (This is a take on constant jokes mostly from black comedians, like Richard Pryor, about unusual people asking for money or food during hard times.) Meanwhile, a botched attempt at laser eye surgery leaves Cartman temporarily blinded. While the others mock him, Veronica comes to visit them. She manages to convince them that she is not a monster but, just as she is about to leave, suddenly takes on a demonic face, laughing maniacally and declaring that they cannot stop her from marrying Chef. The boys try to tell Chef of this at the rehearsal dinner, but he angrily shuts them out. They go back to Cartman's place to formulate a plan to stop the wedding. The boys discover that a succubus controls the minds of men with a melody and that playing it backwards will vanquish it. They remember that Veronica always sings ""The Morning After"" and proceed to learn how to sing the song backwards. At the wedding, they play a tape of the song backwards while Stan and Kyle sing the words in reverse order. Veronica begins to lose her hold on her human form. When the tape gets jammed, she peels off her human disguise and reverts to her true shape; a bizarre red-eyed, bat-winged, hag-like monster, flying around and wrecking the church (killing Kenny in the process). When the boys finish singing the song, Veronica is sucked back into Hell. Chef, no longer under her evil spell, apologizes to the boys for ignoring them and eventually returns to their school as the chef and as his old self. Cartman returns to his optometrist, who tells him that, with eyes as bad as his, he will always have to wear glasses. He solves this problem by convincing the doctor to give him an eye transplant, using Kenny's frozen head as a donor. The optometrist then asks for $3.50, suggesting that Chef's parents' tales were not entirely fabricated. "
wikipedia-2291778," R. J. Reynolds  Richard Joshua ""R. J."" Reynolds (July 20, 1850 - July 29, 1918) was an American businessman and founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The son of a tobacco farmer, he worked for his father and attended Emory and Henry College from 1868 to 1870, eventually graduating from Bryant and Stratton Business College in Baltimore. He sold his share of the family business in 1874 and moved south to Winston-Salem, North Carolina to start his own tobacco company. Reynolds was a savvy businessman and a hard worker, and he quickly became one of the wealthiest citizens of Winston-Salem; eventually, he was the wealthiest person in the state of North Carolina.  He died in 1918 of pancreatic cancer. Biography. Early life. Reynolds was born on July 20, 1850, at Rock Spring Plantation near Critz, Patrick County, Virginia, to Nancy Jane Cox Reynolds and Hardin Reynolds, a tobacco farmer and slaveowner. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In 1874, Reynolds sold his interest in the family tobacco business to his father and left Patrick County to start his own tobacco company. He needed a railroad hub for his business, and since there wasn't one in Patrick County, he went to the nearest one, Winston, NC. Winston and Salem were separate towns at that time. The story goes that he came riding into town on a horse, reading ""The New York Times"", and dreaming of building a golf course somewhere in the rural part of the town. By 1875, Reynolds had established his tobacco manufacturing operation, and in the first year, it produced 150,000 pounds of tobacco. Although Winston-Salem alone had 15 other tobacco companies, Reynolds was able to distinguish himself through his business acumen and innovative techniques, including adding saccharin to chewing tobacco. By the 1890s, production had increased to millions of pounds annually. Reynolds' younger brother, William Neal, was attending Trinity College (now Duke University) and worked part-time for him. Mr. Will, as he was known, began as a leaf-hanger and quickly mastered all facets of the operation. After leaving Trinity College, he managed tobacco purchasing. In 1888, Reynolds formed a formal partnership with Mr. Will and the company bookkeeper, Henry Roan. Reynolds served as President with 75% ownership, and Mr. Will and Henry Roan divided the remainder. The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was chartered as a corporation by the state of North Carolina on February 11, 1890. In 1892, Reynolds' net worth had grown to $200,000. In 1913, Reynolds developed a great innovation: the packaged cigarette. Most tobacco users who smoked cigarettes preferred to roll their own, and there was thought to be no national market for pre-packaged cigarettes. Reynolds worked to develop a flavor he thought would be more appealing than past products, creating the Camel cigarette, so named because it used Turkish paper. Reynolds undercut competitors on the cost of the cigarettes, and within a year, he had sold 425 million packs of Camels. By the time of his death, Reynolds had become the wealthiest man in North Carolina by far; his $66,000 paid annually in taxes was double the next-highest taxpayer. R.J. Reynolds had grown to encompass 121 buildings in Winston-Salem. After his death in 1918, his brother assumed control of the company; board members would wait 41 years before hanging another portrait beside Reynolds' in the R.J. Reynolds board room. Family and personal life. Reynolds was the most eligible bachelor for many years in Winston-Salem and married Mary Katherine Smith (November 17, 1880 - May 23, 1923), who was 30 years his junior, on February 27, 1905 in Mount Airy, North Carolina. She was the daughter of Zachary Taylor Smith (February 19, 1847 - June 13, 1938) and Mary Susan Jackson (January 21, 1855 - April 17, 1926). She was born in Stokes County, North Carolina and died in New York City.  Reynolds and Katherine's father Zachary were cousins, and Reynolds had known Katherine since she was a young girl. She earned a degree in English literature and went to work as a Reynolds secretary, at one point winning $1,000 in a company-sponsored contest. Reynolds joked that he married Katherine to get his money back. Their marriage was very happy, and Reynolds wrote to Katherine saying he was very glad he waited so long to marry. Katherine Reynolds urged her husband to shorten employees' work hours and provide a lunchroom, schools and nursery services for them.  The Reynolds' children were: Reynolds lived above the factory floor for many years. When he married, he lived with his family alongside other R.J. Reynolds executives on Fifth Street in Winston-Salem until 1917, when they moved to Reynolda House, a estate on the outskirts of town that also housed a village where Reynolds workers could live. The grounds featured a post office, schools, a chapel, a blacksmith shop and a greenhouse. At Reynolda House, Katherine brought farmers together to learn the latest scientific advances in farming. Katherine offered evening literacy classes to workers. She also commissioned construction of a nine-hole golf course.  Reynolds died in 1918, and his wife, although 30 years younger, died six years later. They are buried in the Salem Cemetery in Winston-Salem. Their children were then raised by their uncle, Reynolds' brother William Neal Reynolds, and his wife Kate Bitting Reynolds. Dick Reynolds became a Democratic politician, mayor of Winston-Salem, and treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Reynolds's grandson Patrick Reynolds became an anti-smoking activist following several family deaths from smoking and began the Foundation for a Smoke-Free America. Political views. In 1884, Reynolds served as a city commissioner in Winston-Salem. Reynolds established progressive working conditions in his factory, with shorter hours and higher pay. He also signed a petition for a property tax to pay for public schools and voted to approve an income tax. Lasting influence of Reynolds and his family. Reynolds was generous with his workers, building schools and houses for them on his property. He also granted endowments to Guilford College, the Oxford Orphan Asylum, and the Baptist Orphanage, in addition to many other charities and churches in the Winston-Salem community. He became the first southern man to establish a hospital serving African-Americans in the South, the Slater Hospital. He started a savings and loan, served on the town board of Winston-Salem, and began a YMCA and an opera house. Reynolds donated money to the establishment of the Slater Industrial School, which would later become Winston-Salem State University. In 1923, the newly formed Reynolds Foundation fully financed the construction of Nancy Reynolds Memorial School built at the birthplace of his and Will Reynolds' mother, Nancy Jane Cox Reynolds, in the Brown Mountain community of Stokes County. In 1930, the Reynolds Foundation paid for the construction of two wings adjoining the original building. During the Depression, Will Reynolds covered the costs for an additional month of school in order for Nancy Reynolds to become accredited. In the 1950s, the foundation financed and built the school's freestanding gymnasium and built and equipped its large agricultural building. A memorial gift that still provides for the school today is a $25,000 endowment set up after the death of Kate Bitting Reynolds, Will's wife, with the yearly dividends to be used solely for the upkeep of grounds, exterior beautification projects and playground equipment. The endowment's total value is now more than three-quarters of a million dollars and easily supports its intended use.  When Reynolds died, North Carolina's governor Thomas Walter Bickett said: ""Therefore, the greatest eulogy that can be offered would be to refer to his life of rugged honesty, his wide usefulness and his kindly dealings with his fellowmen, which he himself deemed his first duty."" Katharine Reynolds' philanthropy. R. J. Reynolds and his family played a large part in the public life and history of the city of Winston-Salem. After his death, his widow Katharine Smith Reynolds continued his philanthropic activities. She contributed land and funds to establish The Richard J. Reynolds High School and the R. J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium (both listed in the National Register of Historic Places). Construction of the school and auditorium began in 1919 under the direction of architect Charles Barton Keen, and finished in 1924. Another memorial to Reynolds, an equine statue, sits on Winston-Salem City Hall Grounds in downtown Winston-Salem. A memorial to Katharine Reynolds, a 20-foot-tall obelisk, now sits on the grounds of the Richard J. Reynolds High School and R.J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium (it was originally placed on a site in Reynolda Village, around Reynolda Church, but was rescued from demolition and moved to the site on the school grounds). Children's philanthropy. The Reynolds' estate, Reynolda House, was completed just prior to Reynolds' death in 1918 and was later donated by his daughter, Mary Reynolds Babcock, for use as an art museum. At the age of 28, Mary inherited $30 million and became one of the world's richest women. She contributed to the William Neal Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, North Carolina in honor of her uncle. Her will gave $525,000 for a dormitory at Salem College in Winston-Salem. The Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation was formed by Mary Reynolds Babcock and her siblings to honor their brother, Reynolds' son Zachary, whose mysterious death at the age of 20 at Reynolda is still disputed to this day as murder or suicide. The Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation to this day gives away millions annually in the Piedmont Triad region. Babcock and her husband Charles also donated land and funds to start a country club from the grounds of Reynolda in 1939, allowing members to sign up for $1 a year while she was alive. An area of of the grounds of the Reynolda estate was donated to Wake Forest University, which then relocated from Wake Forest, North Carolina to Winston-Salem in 1956 and was given $350,000 annually from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation in exchange for the move. The Reynolds family is honored through many names on the Wake Forest campus, including Reynolda Hall, the university's library, the Z. Smith Reynolds Library, William Neal Reynolds Gymnasium, along with a dormitory named for Mary Reynolds Babcock. Her husband, Charles Babcock, is honored by Wake Forest through the Charles Babcock School of Business Administration. The school was begun through $500,000 each in gifts from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation and Nancy Susan Reynolds. Winston-Salem's airport, the Smith Reynolds Airport, is named for Zachary Smith Reynolds. Reynolds' older son Dick also donated acres of land and funds to the county for the establishment of a golf course and public park in 1939, called Reynolds Park. Its opening in 1940 marked the first time that the Winston-Salem public had access to swimming pools, tennis courts, and a golf course—previously, one had to be a member of a private club to use these types of facilities. Almost a century after her father founded the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Nancy Susan Reynolds Bagley Verney, his youngest daughter and last surviving child, decided to give back to the region of her father's boyhood. In 1969, she deeded Virginia Tech of Rock Spring Plantation. In 1980, she deeded them another , where Reynolds' childhood home and a continuing education center stand. She created an endowment of $1.7 million to provide cultural programming to the surrounding community, to run a forestry research center on the site, and to fund a scholarship program for Patrick County high school students. She financed this in part by selling her Quarry Farm, designed by architect Frank Forster, in Greenwich, Connecticut, to actor Frank Gorshin in 1977 for $650,000 He would later sell it in 1980 to Diana Ross formerly of the Supremes. She also headed the effort to turn the Virginia farmstead where her father was raised into a historic site. Now called the Reynolds Homestead, it is a State and National Historic Landmark listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As a Continuing Education Center of Virginia Tech, it offers a variety of programs and classes for all ages, all open to the public and many for free. It is open for tours, April through October, Monday through Saturday. The house was restored in 1970. Descendents of Hardin and Nancy Reynolds brought together many original heirlooms, including the bed their 16 children were born in. Only eight of their children lived to adulthood. The Homestead includes the historic house, grounds, two cemeteries, and as was the custom of that time a separate three-story brick kitchen, a brick milk house, a spring house, and a log granary. Family's companies. Descendents of Hardin William Reynolds have influenced the economic and cultural growth of the U.S., particularly in the South, through their business successes and philanthropy. In 1919, his nephew, Richard S. Reynolds, Sr., founded the U.S. Foil Company in Louisville, Kentucky, supplying tin-lead wrappers to cigarette and candy companies. In 1924, he bought the maker of Eskimo Pies (which were foil-wrapped) and four years later he purchased Robertshaw Thermostat, Fulton Sylphon, and part of Beechnut Foil, adding the companies to U.S. Foil to form Reynolds Metals. After realizing the limitations of the tin and lead used in his company's products, in 1926 he added aluminum to the line. The company began using aluminum foil as a packaging material in 1926, and in 1947 they introduced Reynolds Wrap. Sold worldwide, it transformed food storage. Reynolds Metals was the second-largest aluminum company in the United States and the third-largest in the world. The Richmond, Virginia-based company was acquired by ALCOA in 2000. "
wikipedia-2291790," Indian School of Mines  The Indian School of Mines (Hindi: भारतीय खनि विद्यापीठ ) is a Deemed University under the Section 3 of University Grants Commission Act, 1956. ISM is located in the mineral-rich region of India, in the city of Dhanbad. It was established by British India Government on the lines of the Royal School of Mines, London, and was formally opened on 9 December 1926 by Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. What started as an institution to impart mining education has now grown into a multi-departmental technical university. ISM admits undergraduate students from the top 0.5% rankers out of the 1.4 million candidates appearing for IIT-JEE Advanced Examination. Indian School of Mines has 17 academic departments covering Engineering, Applied Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences and Management programs with a strong emphasis on scientific and technological education and research in the areas of Earth Sciences. The school has produced many pioneers of the Mining and Oil Industry, including Padma Bhushan awardees. ISM has been ranked consistently as one of the top 12 engineering institutions in India. Status of conversion of ISM into an IIT. The proposal for conversion of ISM into an IIT had been strongly recommended by the Evaluation and Review Committee set up by the Government of India in 1994. It was headed by Prof. S. Sampath (former Director of IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras). However, no action was taken over the proposal. In 2007-08, several new Indian Institutes of Technology were set up and started running without even having a campus, while ISM's conversion into IIT was ignored. So ISM students and teachers felt cheated because ISM was from many years taking in IIT-JEE qualified students (along with the 7 older IIT's and IT-BHU). Significantly, after the conversion of IT-BHU to IIT-BHU in June 2012, ISM is now the only non-IIT institute which admits IIT-JEE (now called IIT-JEE Advanced) qualified students to its various undergraduate and dual degree programmes. In 2009, ISM got the approval of its Finance Committee, Executive Board and General Council, proposing its conversion to an IIT. This was forwarded to Union Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India in early 2010. This was followed by a detailed project report on the conversion prepared by EdCIL (a Public Sector Enterprise), on the directions of the HRD Ministry. The ISM Teachers Association and ISM Alumni Association passed resolutions in 2010-11, favoring this conversion. In September 2011, a resolution was passed by the Government of Jharkhand, recommending to the Government of India to convert ISM to an IIT soon. On 7 May 2012, the Director of Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, Prof. D.C. Panigrahi gave a detailed presentation highlighting the various aspects of institute and the need for its conversion to an IIT, at the Yojana Bhawan, Planning commission. The meeting was chaired by Narendra Jadhav, Member of MHRD. The conclusion that came to be was inclusion of the conversion in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17). In June 2012, a Planning Commission panel, on a reference to it from the Union Cabinet, favoured that this conversion be done, during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) and in such a possible way that ISM's core competency in mining and geology is maintained. The proposal to convert ISM to IIT became a part of the new 5 Year Plan after its passage by the Prime Minister headed National Development Council or NDC, on 27 December 2012. The NDC comprises the Prime Minister of India, the Union Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers of all States, and members of the Planning Commission. It is worth mentioning that ISM is the only institute of India selected by NDC to be converted into an IIT in the 12th Five Year Plan. However, the inclusion in 5 Year Plan itself does not guarantee that ISM would be converted into IIT. After receiving recommendation from the NDC, MHRD sent a letter to ISM administration demanding the institutional specifications and variants, comparing it to the other IITs and a report was sent from ISM to MHRD for the same. This report was approved by the officials and has been further forwarded to the IIT Council (consisting of HRD Minister, all IIT's Directors, some M.P.'s) for their advice on this matter. A meeting of IIT Council for the same was held on 7 January 2013. In this meeting, it was decided that a committee be formed to look into the matter afresh and it's financial implications. The IIT Council in its meeting on 16 September 2013 deferred the conversion for atleast another six months. Also, in the meeting,a committee headed by Prof. Ashok Mishra (Ex Director IIT Bombay) was set up to look into the issue. The committee will submit its report by the end of November 2013. For this conversion, an Institutes of Technology Amendment Bill to amend the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 needs to be introduced in Indian Parliament by the Union HRD Minister. History. The Indian National Congress at its XVII Session of December 1901 passed a resolution stating that: The McPherson Committee formed by Government of India, recommended the establishment of an institution for imparting education in the fields of Mining and Geology, whose report, submitted in 1920, formed the main basis for establishment of the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. The Indian School of Mines was formally opened by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin on 9 December 1926 as the first mining technology institute of the country. During the inaugural lecture, Lord Irwin stated: The institute initially offered courses in Mining Engineering, Applied Geology, Applied Physics, Applied Chemistry and Applied Mathematics. In 1957, the institute began offering Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics. Up to 1967 it was a pure government institute where the faculties were recruited through the UPSC Selection Board. The all round achievement by the graduates of Indian School of Mines in nation building was duly recognized and the School was granted university status under the University Grants Commission Act in 1967. Later courses in Mining Machinery Engineering and Mineral Engineering were started in 1975 and 1976 respectively. It was among the few institutes to start courses in Industrial Engineering and Management (in 1977), to cater to the needs of industries like metallurgy, mining and manufacturing. Recent Changes. From 1996-97 the School came directly under the Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India with pay scales and perks to its employees at par with that of Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management. In 1997, the institute began admitting students through the Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE) conducted jointly by the sixteen Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. In 1998 courses for Electronics Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering were introduced and in 1999, the institute started a bachelor of technology course in Mechanical Engineering. In 2006, ISM added 14 new courses, prominent among them being Electrical Engineering and a course in Environmental Engineering in the undergraduate curriculum. ISM started integrated Graduate engineering and management courses in mining, mineral and petroleum engineering as well which was the first such course offered by any technical institution in India. ISM also started offering Integrated Master of Science (Int. M.Sc) in Applied Physics, Applied Chemistry and Mathematics & Computing, and Integrated Master of Science and Technology (Int. M.Sc Tech) courses for Applied Geology and Applied Geophysics. In 2011 ISM introduced an additional course in Chemical Engineering. The institute aims to introduce Civil Engineering in 2013. Location. The Indian School of Mines is located in the city of Dhanbad, which is also known as the coal capital of India, in the Indian state of Jharkhand. The institute is surrounded by National Level offices related to coal mining such as the Directorate General of Mines Safety, the Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research and the offices of Bharat Coking Coal Limited. ISM is located 3 km from the Dhanbad Railway Station, which lies on the Kolkata-Delhi railway line. Dhanbad is also connected with Kolkata by National Highway-2. Departments and Centres. ISM has the following Departments and Centres: Academic Programmes. ISM offers courses in engineering, pure sciences, management and humanities with a focus on engineering. The programs and courses offered at ISM are changing as the school evolving into a full fledged engineering university from the earlier focus on mining and earth sciences. The institute currently has 17 departments and 5 inter-disciplinary centres. The Department of Mining Engineering has been accorded the status of “Centre of Advanced Studies” by the UGC. ISM is the only institute of its kind in India that caters to the human resource needs of the nation in the areas of Mining, Petroleum, Mining Machinery, Mineral engineering and Earth Sciences besides training manpower in the related disciplines of Management, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, applied Science and Humanities and Social Sciences. The school conducts educational programs leading to the degree of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Master of Science (MSc.), Master of Science and Technology (M.Sc.Tech.), Integrated Master of Science (M.Sc), Integrated Master of Science and Technology (M.Sc Tech.), Master of Technology (M.Tech.), Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech), Integrated Master of Technology (Integrated M.Tech), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD.). Admission to the courses of B.Tech, Dual Degree and Integrated courses are done from IIT-JEE Advanced qualified students. Admission to the M.Tech courses are done either through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) or through a special examination conducted by the institute. Admissions to the MBA program is done through the Common Admission Test (CAT). Admission to the M.Sc.Tech. and PhD courses are done through examinations conducted by the institute. Campus. ISM is in the final stage of acquiring new land adjacent to the present campus, which will nearly double its area. At present it is spread over an area of 88 hectares (220 acres). The Main Building, also popularly known as the Heritage Building houses the departments of Mining Engineering, Applied Geology, Applied Geophysics and Electrical Engineering. In addition it also contains the Geological Museum. The Penman Auditorium situated in the rear portion of the main building is used for functions having a bigger audience while the Golden Jubilee Lecture Theatre (GJLT) is used for workshops, presentations and seminars. Some unique features at the ISM are the Geological Museum, the Seismic Observatory, a Data Processing Laboratory, the Long Wall Mine Gallery and the Remote Sensing Laboratory.

wikipedia-2291804," Microsoft Office Live Meeting  Microsoft Office Live Meeting is a discontinued commercial subscription-based web conferencing service operated by Microsoft. Live Meeting includes software that is installed on client PCs, and uses a central server for all clients to connect to. Currently, those servers are under the control of Microsoft, however, Microsoft also produces Microsoft Lync Server which is an enterprise conferencing server product. Overview. Microsoft Office Live Meeting is a separate piece of software which is installed on a user's PC (Windows Based Meeting Console). The software is available for free download from the Microsoft website. There is also a Java based console which has antecedent release functionality. This also operates in Mac and Solaris environments. The desktop client for Live Meeting is not compatible on the Mac in either Firefox or Safari 3.x, however non-Windows users can connect to a web-based Live Meeting, if the meeting organizer publishes an HTTP URL to access the meeting. According to Microsoft technical support on September 26, 2008, there is no release date planned for Safari 3.x compatibility. Live Meeting is convergence software (i.e., allows integration with an audio conference). Using the web you are able to control PSTN lines (mute all parties except your own, eject parties, etc.). User accounts are grouped together in Conference Centers (a unique URL) which starts with: www.livemeeting.com/cc/. . . or www.placeware.com/cc/. . . Users pay nothing to join a Live Meeting session. Charging for Live Meeting is done on an account basis. Supply of accounts is mostly done by resellers (Global Telecoms companies) who supply per minute or monthly standing charges. With the introduction of Office 365 Office Live Meeting customers are being encouraged to move to Microsoft Lync Server. Live Meeting 2007. With Live Meeting 2007 Microsoft offers both a hosted model for Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007 as well as a CPE (customer premise equipment) solution, namely Office Communications Server 2007. In addition to Microsoft directly hosting Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007, hosting partners will also offer Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007 as a fee-based service. Whether attendees use the Live Meeting service or the Office Communications Server 2007 (OCS 2007) to power their web conference, they will use the same client to deliver a seamless meeting experience. Live Meeting Web Access (MWA) was redesigned in this release to provide a user experience that is nearly identical to the new Windows-based Live Meeting client. One huge benefit is that Live Meeting Web Access is a Java applet and therefore is available on non-Windows operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, and MacOS. The Live Meeting product is also intended to operate with the Polycom CX5000 (formerly known as the Microsoft RoundTable) which is a 360 degree video camera optimized to work with Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007. One new feature included in this version allows the Microsoft Office Live Meeting client to automatically switch the larger video window to the actively speaking participant. This auto-switch feature isn't specific to the Polycom CX5000 product - it will work with any USB-based camera. The main advantage of the CX5000 is its 360 degree camera view, which is suitable for conference rooms with several participants. With specially designed microphones, the CX5000 is able to determine the location of the active speaker and then tell Microsoft Office Live Meeting which camera angle to focus on. History. Live Meeting was originally a separate company called PlaceWare. Microsoft acquired PlaceWare to improve upon NetMeeting, its own webconferencing technology. Microsoft subsequently dropped development of NetMeeting. "

wikipedia-2291834," Greg Matthews  Gregory Richard John ""Mo"" Matthews (born 15 December 1959 in Newcastle, New South Wales) is a former New South Wales and Australian cricket all rounder (off spin bowler and left handed batsman) who is now a television cricket commentator. When Australian cricket was in the doldrums in the mid-1980s ""his dashing batsmanship and growing ability as a spin bowler suddenly elevated Matthews to a position of a national hero"". He made centuries in times of crisis against New Zealand and India in 1985-86, took ten wickets in the Tied Test at Madras and batted well against England in 1986-87. Thereafter his career declined as the ""effervesent and unorthodox"" Matthews did not fit in with the rest of the Australian Test team. As Australia rose to dominance in the 1990s Matthews proved to be ""not good enough in either of the game's main departments to make a lasting impact as a Test all-rounder"" and despite a century against England in 1990-91 he played only irregularly and was finally dropped in 1993. He continued to play with success for New South Wales until he retired in 1997. Early life. During his youth Matthews attended Ermington Public School and played for the Rydalmere Cricket Club, where he won the Under 11s Northern Districts Cricket Association Cricketer of the Year Award in 1970-71 and 1971-72. Prior to his cricket career taking off, Matthews played Colts (under 20's) Rugby for the Eastwood Rugby Club and was a pro for the Cumbrian side Whitehaven Cricket Club for three seasons, starring in the clubs 1981 league championship victory. At the conclusion of a successful season for Eastwood there was speculation that cricket may be put aside for Rugby, but he opted to play cricket. Early Test Career. ""Matthews is a tough, useful, determined little cricketer; a steady, flat, off-spin bowler; a staunch, correct left-hand bat; and a brilliant fielder. He is also a cocky, slightly zany character."" Early in his cricketing career Matthews was regarded ""as a bowler who fielded energetically and could bat a bit"" and a ""complete extrovert, dressing to shock"". He was usually referred to as Greg, but his teammates nicknamed him 'Mo', ""short for 'misère', which he always called when we played five hundred"". Matthews enjoyed clubbing and ignored the midnight curfew imposed by New South Wales fast bowler Geoff Lawson as ""these were his socialising hours and the time he came to life"", and his mantra was ""'live each day as if it's your last'"". He was first picked for the Australia against Pakistan in the Fourth Test at Melbourne in 1983-84, taking 2/95 and 2/48, running out Zaheer Abbas in the first innings and bowling him in the second. With the bat he made 75, joining Graham Yallop (268) on 354/7 and adding 185 together for the eighth wicket. The Test was drawn and Matthews was kept for the Fifth Test and was Greg Chappell's batting partner when he was dismissed for 182 in his final Test innings. Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh also retired and the Australian Test team was further weakened by the Rebel Tour of South Africa in 1984-85. This provided opportunities for ambitious young players, but Matthews was initially unable to capitalise. He was taken on the unsuccessful tour of the West Indies in 1983-84, where he played in the Fifth Test and was a makeshift opener in the second innings as Steve Smith was injured. At home he played another one-off Test against the West Indies in the Fourth Test, dismissing Viv Richards (208) and Clive Lloyd (91) with his 2/67 in a draw that ended their 11 match winning streak. He was not one of the three spinners chosen for the Fifth Test on his home ground at Sydney where Australia won by an innings. Nevertheless he was taken to England in 1985, where he proved popular in the county matches. In the One Day Internationals Matthews batted at number eight and hit the winning runs at Old Trafford (22 not out) and Lord's (29 not out) as Australia won the Texaco Trophy 2-1. In the Third Test at Trent Bridge he mixed with the crowd and read a newspaper in the stands; ""Matthews of the ""petit-punk"" hair and puppet movements...has a happy knack of winding up crowds"". In the Test series he only played in the Fourth Test because Graeme Wood was injured and again volunteered to open the innings, but also ran out Allan Lamb from extra cover. Matthews had now played in five Test matches, but had only made 139 runs (19.85) and taken 7 wikcets (45.28) and was far from establishing his place in the Australia team. Australia vs New Zealand 1985-86. ""Greg Matthews joined me at the wicket to start an innings which was to 'make' him as a Test cricketer...I think we had all regarded him as a bowler who fielded energetically and could bat a bit. We'd misjudged him, and that century put the true all-rounder stamp on him."" The First Test against New Zealand at the Woolloongabba saw Australia lose their third Test in a row by an innings as Richard Hadlee took 15/123. Matthews was Australian's best bowler (3/110) and joined the Australian captain Allan Border at 67/5 in the second innings with 307 runs required to make New Zealand bat again. He made his first Test century - 115 off 229 balls with 10 fours and a six - and most of the 197 runs added with Border (152), a record sixth wicket stand for Australia against New Zealand. This was backed up with 50 and 32 in the Second Test at Sydney, which Australia won by 4 wickets and he was second in the Australian series batting averages after the captain with 247 runs (41.16). Australia vs India 1985-86. New Zealand was only the third country to beat Australia at home after England and the West Indies and India looked set to be come the fourth. They made scores of 520, 445, 59/2 and 600/4 in the Tests and Matthews suffered with the other Australian bowlers, taking only two wickets (118.00) in the series. In the Second Test at Melbourne he came in at 109/5 and made 100 not out adding 46 for the last wicket with his New South Wales team-mate Dave Gilbert (4) - who came in when Matthews was 59 - to hoist the Australian total up to 262. Lacklustre Indian batting and late rain saved the match after Allan Border (163) and Gilbert (10 not out) made a reargaurd action in the second innings. Though they outplayed Australia in all three Tests this was the nearest Inida came to winning a Test and the series. Benson and Hedges World Series Cup 1985-86. After the two Test series there was a triangular World Series Cup One Day series between Australia, New Zealand and India, who were the current World Champions, and Australia and India made it into the best out of three finals. In the First WSC Final Matthews was run out for 7 in Australia's 170/8, but returned an econmonical 9-0-27-3 to bowl out India for 159 to win by 11 runs. In the Second WSC Final he took 10-0-37-2 to restrict India to 187 and saw Australia win the game by 7 wickets and the Finals 2-0 without the need for a third game. Matthews was voted Player of the Finals and it was a considerable boost to Australian confidence as the team completed a lap of honour round the Melbourne Cricket Ground. New Zealand vs Australia 1985-86. ""I could never analyse why, right from the outset, sections of the New Zealand crowds had taken a set against Greg. Perhaps it was his juanty manner on the field. Perhaps he was a shade too successful for the liking of the more rabidly parochial Kiwi fans...You could never understand the mentality behind the crank phone calls Greg received in New Zealand, the egg-throwing and the incident in Wellington where a toilet seat was thrown on the field"".  Australia toured New Zealand in 1985-86 and lost their second series against them in the same season despite several improvements. In the First Test, Matthews (130) came in at 166/4 and added 213 for the fifth wicket with Greg Ritchie (92), a record for Australia vs New Zealand and Matthews' highest Test score. Rain ensured a draw in both the first two Tests and in the Second Matthews had the unusual bowling analysis of 3-3-0-1 when he caught and bowled Bruce Edgar in New Zealand's second innings of 16/1. Australia lost the Third Test when they collapsed to 103 in the second innings and lost by 8 wickets. Matthews had taken his then best Test bowling of 4/61, dismissing Bruce Edgar (24), Ken Rutherford (0) and Martin Crowe (0) with the score on 73. This gave him 8 wickets (29.50), his best series bowling so far, but he had taken only 23 wickets (43.69) in 14 Tests to add to his 725 runs (32.95). The Australian captain Allan Border threatened to resign if Australia did not win the four game One Day International and then saw New Zealand go 2-0 up. Fortunately Australia won the last two games and Matthews was Man of the Match in the Fourth ODI at Eden Park, where he made 54, took 9-1-33-3 and held onto three catches in Australia's 44 run win. This allowed Border to announce that the team had improved enough for him not to resign, much to the advantage of Australian cricket. India vs Australia 1986-87 and The Second Tied Test. ""There were many heros throughout the exhausting five days of play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us in the game and then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner."" Australia toured India at the start of the 1986-87 season and played the First Test at Madras, a huge concrete bowl which radiated the intense heat, which rose to 50°C with 90% humidity. Allan Border won the toss and Australia declared on 574/7 on the third day when Matthews was out for 44. In the Indian innings he took 5/103, his first five wicket haul in Test cricket, as his dismissed Sunil Gavaskar (caught and bowled), Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Chandrakant Pandit and Kapil Dev as India were bowled out for 397. Declining to enforce the follow on in the heat Border batted again and Matthews made 27 not out in Australia's 170/5, which set India 348 runs to win on the last day. Matthews dismissed Srikkanth, Mohinder Amarnath and Pandit as India collapsed from 200/2 to 291/6. His 40th over was the last that could be played in the match, bowling to Ravi Shastri, with India's last man Maninder Singh at the bowler's end. India needed four runs to win from the 6-ball over with only one wicket remaining; India were all out for 347, Matthews having taken 5/146 (10/249 in the match) and the match was the Second Tied Test in cricket history. It was the second and last time that he would take five wickets in a Test innings and the only time that he took ten wickets in a Test match. Dean Jones (210) was 'man of the match', but to applease local opinion so was Kapil Dev (119). Greg Matthews was later made 'all-rounder of the match'. The Second Test began with three days rain and Matthews did not bat or bowl. The Third Test was a draw, Matthews taking 4/158 to dismiss Gavaskar, Srikkanth, Amarnath and Mohammad Azharuddin in India's only innings. He took 14 wickets (29.07) and made 91 runs (45.50) in the series, his most successful with the ball. Australia vs England 1986-87. ""When, at the start of the following season, Australia found themselves in trouble against England in the Brisbane Test, there was an extraordinary display of faith in his ability: up in the Press-box at The Gabba the assembled army of journalists, almost to a man, uttered statesments of relief when they saw Matthews emerging from the pavillion at number seven. He was the man to stop the rot they felt. He duly made fifty and by dogged batting and a good deal of talking managed to stave off a second defeat in the next game at Perth. But gradually his outer ebullience became crushed by inner doubts and by the end of the summer he was being viewed by some disillusioned scribes as just another player in a country which had temporarily lost its grip on international cricket"" Matthews returned to Australia as with improved all-rounder credentials and the Test team's first choice spinner. Despite high hopes of regaining The Ashes against an England team that ""can't bat, can't bowl and can't field"" Australia found itself in trouble again. Allan Border won the toss at The Gabba and put England in to bat and watched them make 456. Greg Matthews was the most senior of bowlers, and had played as many Tests (17) as the others combined; Bruce Reid (8), Steve Waugh (8), Merv Hughes (1) and Chris Matthews (0). Still, he made a gritty 56 not out in the first innings, but Australia could not avoid the follow-on and lost by 7 wickets. In the Second Test at the WACA England made 592/7 declared and Matthews batted for 190 minutes for his 45 and 14 not out to see out the draw. The Third Test at Adelaide finally saw Australia on top, but Border declared their innings on 514/5 with Matthews on 73 not out and Waugh on 79 not out after complaining about their slow scoring rate. In any case England had no trouble drawing the match on a slow, flat wicket, though Matthews did bowl the England captain Mike Gatting for a first ball duck. The Fourth Test at Melbourne was a debacle as the Australian batsmen threw their wickets away to Ian Botham (5/41) and Gladstone Small (5/48) and losing inside three days. Although he had made 217 runs (53.75) Matthews had taken only two wickets (147.50) and could hardly justify his place in the bowling line up. With The Ashes out of reach the selectors dropped David Boon, Greg Matthews and Craig McDermott for the Fifth Test, which was won thanks to the debutant spinner Peter Taylor. Out of the Test Team 1986-1990. ""He wasn't fitting in with the team. On many occasions he had breakfast alone, and he wasn't one to spend more time at a bar with the boys when there was a disco on hand. The ""minor"" things were causing a rift - his eating habits, his hair-style, his choice of clothes, or whatever, seemed to be an extra reason why he wasn't one of the boys."" Matthews would remain out of favour with the Australian Test selectors for four years. Despite his 10 wicket hall in the Tied Test his bowling was not of Test standard and his batting average 36.82 was not enough to keep him in the team by itself when David Boon, Allan Border, Dean Jones and Steve Waugh were occupying the middle order. He did play One Day Internationals until the Sharjah Cup in 1986-87, where he had an off-field argument over a barbecued steak and was fined $1,000 by Ian McDonald and Bobby Simpson. Steve Waugh thought he ""was being punished largely for previous infractions and perceived attitude problems...and straight away you could sense that a couple of guys felt their careers might be over"". Bobby Simpson was Matthews' personal manager and the Australian coach and though he had been supportive in his early career, but now wanted a more disciplined team and Matthews did not fit in. Australia vs England 1990-91. ""He was always excellent for the shock-value element, but also a guy who could play better than he probably ever realised and who record as an all-rounder for NSW is unrivalled."" Matthews continued to play well for New South Wales and was recalled for the First Test against England at Brisbane in 1990-91. Peter Taylor had not proved to be a long term success and Matthews was the only Australian spinner in the side, apart from Allan Border. He made 35 batting at number seven and took 1/30, but Australia won by eight wickets and he kept his place. He took 3/40 in the Second Test at Melbourne and 2/26 at in the Third Test at Sydney, where he also hit 128 with 17 boundaries to lift Australia from 292/5 to 512/9. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide he made 65 and 34 not out and 60 not out at Perth in the Fifth. Australia won the series 3-0 and Matthews made 353 runs (70.60), his best Test series with the bat, though he only took 7 wickets (60.28). Later Test Career. Back in the team Matthews was selected for the tour of the West Indies on 1990-91, but did little and was dropped after the Second Test. Missing out on the 1991-92 home series he was picked again for the tour of Sri Lanka and here he did better. In the First Test at Colombo he was Man of the Match as he made 6 and 64, took 3/93 and 4/76 and caught Ranjith Madurasinghe off Shane Warne to give Australia a 16 run win. He followed this up with 55, 51, 57 and 96 to draw the two following Tests and Australia won the series. He was kept for the First Test against the West Indies at The Gabba in 1992-93, but again failed and was dropped. Recalled for the Third Test at Sydney he made 79, but was hit for 2/169 as Brian Lara made 277 in the tourists 606. With Shane Warne in the side Australia no longer needed Matthews as a spinner, he could not get a place on his batting alone and he never played for Australia again. Matthews later hinted at politics being behind his lack of test cricket. Some guys chew gum. Some chew their nails. Some abuse their team-mates. I played air guitar. I sang to the crowd. I sang to myself and I danced. I said things to the good sorts in the crowd. Can someone please tell me what’s wrong with that? People say Mark Waugh was a great player. I think I averaged 41, the same as him, and he played in a team that rarely lost. I played in a side that rarely won. There’s one reason why I didn’t play more and the brothers his Australian team-mates know the reasons why I wasn’t picked, and it wasn’t because my bowling average was 48. I can’t say why; I’m going to write it myself. Later career. In September 1997 Matthews became the New South Wales representative of the Australian Cricketers' Association, which had been formed in August on the 1997 tour of England. Matthews currently plays in the Sydney Grade Cricket competition for the University of Sydney team and had a bowling average of 11.04 for the 2008 season. On 24 January 2009, he bowled Australia opener Phil Jaques for 5 with his first ball when Sydney University was playing Sutherland. In 2009 he co-hosted SBS televisions coverage of The Ashes series alongside former Test players Stuart MacGill and Damien Martyn.

With the Australian cricket coach Bobby Simpson as his manager he soon became a wealthy man, endorsing a whole range or products, until he and Simpson fell out. He later set up cricket coaching clinics with Steve Waugh and Brad McNamara in 1991-92. However, the distraction of having agents and pushing products unsettled his career, and he was ""not so good that he can succeed in high company with giving his game everything he has"". Matthews was involved in a high-profile """"yeah, yeah"""" promotion for a hair regrowth company, Advanced Hair Studio, as have cricketers Graham Gooch, Martin Crowe and Shane Warne. "

He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1980 and settled in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City. When Delgado was growing up, hip hop music was rising in popularity in his neighborhood. Delgado took on stage name Cuban Link and associated with fellow rappers Big Pun and Triple Seis in a trio under names Caribbean Connection and Full-A-Clips. Cuban Link and Big Pun both made guest performances on The Beatnuts' single ""Off the Books"" in 1997. They joined the local rap group Terror Squad, and Link performed on the track ""Tell Me What You Want"" from the group's self-titled debut album. Link previously did guest appearances on Squad members' solo albums: Big Pun's ""Capital Punishment"" and Fat Joe's ""Don Cartagena"".

wikipedia-2291915," Buddhism in Thailand  Buddhism in Thailand is largely of the Theravada school. Nearly 95% of Thailand's population is Buddhist of the Theravada school, though Buddhism in this country has become integrated with folk beliefs as well as Chinese religions from the large Thai-Chinese population. Buddhist temples in Thailand are characterized by tall golden stupas, and the Buddhist architecture of Thailand is similar to that in other Southeast Asian countries, particularly Cambodia and Laos, with which Thailand shares cultural and historical heritage. Historical background. Thai Buddhism was based on the religious movement founded in the 6th century BC by Siddhartha, later known as the Buddha, who urged the world to relinquish the extremes of sensuality and self-mortification and follow the enlightened Middle Way. The focus of this religion is on man, not gods; the assumption is that life is pain or suffering, which is a consequence of craving, and that suffering can end only if desire ceases. The end of suffering is the achievement of nirvana (in Theravada Buddhist scriptures, nibbana), often defined as the absence of craving and therefore of suffering, sometimes as enlightenment or bliss. By the 3rd century BC, Buddhism had spread widely in Asia, and divergent interpretations of the Buddha's teachings had led to the establishment of several sects. The teachings that reached Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka) were first written down in Pali (an Indo-Aryan language closely related to Sanskrit) in the 1st century AD and provided the Tipitaka (the scriptures or ""three baskets""; in Sanskrit, Tripitaka) of Theravada Buddhism. This form of Buddhism was made the state religion only with the establishment of the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai in the 13th century AD. According to many historians, around 228 BC Sohn Uttar Sthavira (one of the royal monks sent by Ashoka the Great) came to Suvarnabhumi (or Suvannabhumi) which some identify with Thailand along with other monks and sacred books. 13th–19th centuries. The details of the history of Buddhism in Thailand from the 13th to the 19th century are obscure, in part because few historical records or religious texts survived the Burmese destruction of Ayutthaya, the capital city of the kingdom, in 1767. The anthropologist-historian S. J. Tambiah, however, has suggested a general pattern for that era, at least with respect to the relations between Buddhism and the sangha on the one hand and the king on the other hand. In Thailand, as in other Theravada Buddhist kingdoms, the king was in principle thought of as patron and protector of the religion (sasana) and the sangha, while sasana and the sangha were considered in turn the treasures of the polity and the signs of its legitimacy. Religion and polity, however, remained separate domains, and in ordinary times the organizational links between the sangha and the king were not close. Among the chief characteristics of Thai kingdoms and principalities in the centuries before 1800 were the tendency to expand and contract, problems of succession, and the changing scope of the king's authority. In effect, some Thai kings had greater power over larger territories, others less, and almost invariably a king who sought successfully to expand his power also exercised greater control over the sangha. That control was coupled with greater support and patronage of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. When a king was weak, however, protection and supervision of the sangha also weakened, and the sangha declined. This fluctuating pattern appears to have continued until the emergence of the Chakri Dynasty in the last quarter of the 18th century. Modern era. By the 19th century, and especially with the coming to power in 1851 of King Mongkut, who had been a monk himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical in nature and its links to the state more institutionalized. As a monk, Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the Dhammayuttika order of monks. Under the reform, all practices having no authority other than custom were to be abandoned, canonical regulations were to be followed not mechanically but in spirit, and acts intended to improve an individual's standing on the road to nirvana but having no social value were rejected. This more rigorous discipline was adopted in its entirety by only a small minority of monasteries and monks. The Mahanikaya order, perhaps somewhat influenced by Mongkut's reforms but with a less exacting discipline than the Dhammayuttika order, comprised about 95 percent of all monks in 1970 and probably about the same percentage in the late 1980s. In any case, Mongkut was in a position to regularize and tighten the relations between monarchy and sangha at a time when the monarchy was expanding its control over the country in general and developing the kind of bureaucracy necessary to such control. The administrative and sangha reforms that Mongkut started were continued by his successor. In 1902 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868–1910) made the new sangha hierarchy formal and permanent through the Sangha Law of 1902, which remained the foundation of sangha administration in modern Thailand. Influences. Three major forces have influenced the development of Buddhism in Thailand. The most visible influence is that of the Theravada school of Buddhism, imported from Sri Lanka. While there are significant local and regional variations, the Theravada school provides most of the major themes of Thai Buddhism. By tradition, Pāli is the language of religion in Thailand. Scriptures are recorded in Pāli, using either the modern Thai script or the older Khom and Tham scripts. Pāli is also used in religious liturgy, despite the fact that most Thais understand very little of this ancient language. The Pāli Tipitaka is the primary religious text of Thailand, though many local texts have been composed in order to summarise the vast number of teachings found in the Tipitaka. The monastic code (Patimokkha) followed by Thai monks is taken from the Pāli Theravada Canon. The second major influence on Thai Buddhism is Hindu beliefs received from Cambodia, particularly during the Sukhothai period. Vedic Hinduism played a strong role in the early Thai institution of kingship, just as it did in Cambodia, and exerted influence in the creation of laws and order for Thai society as well as Thai religion. Certain rituals practiced in modern Thailand, either by monks or by Hindu ritual specialists, are either explicitly identified as Hindu in origin, or are easily seen to be derived from Hindu practices. While the visibility of Hinduism in Thai society has been diminished substantially during the Chakri dynasty, Hindu influences, particularly shrines to the god Brahma, continue to be seen in and around Buddhist institutions and ceremonies. Folk religion—attempts to propitiate and attract the favor of local spirits known as ""phi""—forms the third major influence on Thai Buddhism. While Western observers (as well as urbane and Western-educated Thais) have often drawn a clear line between Thai Buddhism and folk religious practices, this distinction is rarely observed in more rural locales. Spiritual power derived from the observance of Buddhist precepts and rituals is employed in attempting to appease local nature spirits. Many restrictions observed by rural Buddhist monks are derived not from the orthodox Vinaya, but from taboos derived from the practice of folk magic. Astrology, numerology, and the creation of talismans and charms also play a prominent role in Buddhism as practiced by the average Thai—practices that are proscribed in Buddhist texts (see Digha Nikaya 2, ff). Additionally, more minor influences can be observed stemming from contact with Mahayana Buddhism. Early Buddhism in Thailand is thought to have been derived from an unknown Mahayana tradition. While Mahayana Buddhism was gradually eclipsed in Thailand, certain features of Thai Buddhism—such as the appearance of the bodhisattva Lokesvara in some Thai religious architecture, and the belief that the king of Thailand is a bodhisattva himself—reveal the influence of Mahayana concepts. In modern times, additional Mahayana influence has stemmed from the presence of Chinese immigrants in Thai society. While some Chinese have ""converted"" to Thai-style Theravada Buddhism, many others maintain their own separate temples in the East Asian Mahayana tradition. The growing popularity of the goddess Kuan Yin in Thailand (a form of Avalokitesvara) may be attributed to the Chinese Mahayanist presence in Thailand. Government ties. While Thailand is currently a constitutional monarchy, it inherited a strong Southeast Asian tradition of Buddhist kingship that tied the legitimacy of the state to its protection and support for Buddhist institutions. This connection has been maintained into the modern era, with Buddhist institutions and clergy being granted special benefits by the government, as well as being subjected to a certain amount of government oversight. In addition to the ecclesiastic leadership of the ""sangha"", a secular government ministry supervises Buddhist temples and monks. The legal status of Buddhist sects and reform movements has been an issue of contention in some cases, particularly in the case of Santi Asoke, which was legally forbidden from calling itself a Buddhist denomination, and in the case of the ordination of women- monks attempting to revive the Theravada bhikkhuni lineage have been prosecuted for attempting to impersonate members of the clergy. To obtain a passport for travel abroad, a monk must have an official letter from Sangha Supreme Council granting the applicant permission to travel abroad; Buddhist monk identification card; a copy of House/Temple Registration; and submit any previous Thai Passport or a certified copy thereof. In addition to state support and recognition—-in the form of formal gifts to monasteries made by government officials and the royal family (for example, Kathin)—-a number of special rights are conferred upon Buddhist monks. They are granted free passage on public transportation, and most train stations and airports have special seating sections reserved for members of the clergy. Conversely, ordained monastics are forbidden from standing for office or voting in elections. Calls for state establishment. In 2007, calls were made by some Thais for Buddhism to be recognized in the new national constitution as a state religion. This suggestion was initially rejected by the committee charged with drafting the new constitution. This move prompted a number of protests from supporters of the initiative, including a number of marches on the capital and a hunger strike by twelve Buddhist monks. Some critics of the plan, including scholar and social critic Sulak Sivaraksa, have claimed that the movement to declare Buddhism a national religion is motivated by political gain, and may be being manipulated by supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra. The Constitution Drafting Committee later voted against the special status of Buddhism, provoking the religious groups. The groups condemned the Committee and the constitution draft. On August 11, Sirikit, the Queen of Thailand, expressed her concern over the issue. According to her birthday speech, Buddhism is beyond politics. Some Buddhist organizations announced the break of the campaigns a day after. Ordination and clergy. Like in most other Theravada nations, Buddhism in Thailand is represented primarily by the presence of Buddhist monks, who serve as officiants on ceremonial occasions, as well as being responsible for preserving and conveying the teachings of the Buddha. During the latter half of the 20th century, most monks in Thailand began their careers by serving as ""dek wat"" () (literally, 'child of the wat'). ""Dek wat"" are traditionally no younger than eight, and do minor housework around the temple. The primary reason for becoming a ""dek wat"" is to gain a basic education, particularly in basic reading and writing and the memorization of the scriptures chanted on ritual occasions. Prior to the creation of state-run primary schools in Thailand, village temples served as the primary form of education for most Thai boys. Service in a temple as a ""dek wat"" was a necessary prerequisite for attaining any higher education, and was the only learning available to most Thai peasants. Since the creation of a government-run educational apparatus in Thailand, the number of children living as ""dek wat"" has declined significantly. However, many government-run schools continue to operate on the premise of the local village temple. Formerly known as ""dek wat"", typically for four years or more, boys now typically ordain as a samanen () often shortened to ""nen"" (). In some localities, girls may become samaneri. Novices live according to the Ten Precepts, but are not required to follow the full range of monastic rules found in the Patimokkha (Buddhist monastic code). There are a few other significant differences between novices and monks. Novices often are in closer contact with their families, spending more time in the homes of their parents than monks. Novices do not participate in the recitation of the monastic code (and the confessions of violations) that take place on the uposatha days. Novices technically do not eat with the monks in their temple, but this typically only amounts to a gap in seating, rather than the separation observed between monks and the laity. Novices usual ordain during a break from secular schooling, but those intending on a religious life, may receive secular schooling at the wat. Young men typically do not live as a novice for longer than one or two years. At the age of 20, they become eligible to receive upasampada, the higher ordination that establishes them as a full bhikkhu. A novice is technically sponsored by his parents in his ordination, but in practice in rural villages the entire village participates by providing the robes, alms bowl, and other requisites that will be required by the monk in his monastic life. Temporary ordination is the norm among Thai Buddhists. Most young men traditionally ordain for the term of a single rainy season (known in Pāli as ""vassa"", and in Thai as ""phansa""). Those who remain monks beyond their first ""vassa"" typically remain monks for between one and three years, officiating at religious ceremonies in surrounding villages and possibly receiving further education in reading and writing (possibly including the Kham or Tham scripts traditionally used in recording religious texts). After this period of one to three years, most young monks return to lay life, going on to marry and begin a family. Young men in Thailand who have undergone ordination are seen as being more suitable partners for marriage; unordained men are euphemistically called 'unripe', while those who have been ordained are said to be 'ripe'. A period as a monk is a prerequisite for many positions of leadership within the village hierarchy. Most village elders or headmen were once monks, as were most traditional doctors, spirit priests, and some astrologists and fortune tellers. Monks who do not return to lay life typically specialize in either scholarship or meditation. Those who specialize in scholarship typically travel to regional education centers to begin further instruction in the Pāli language and the scriptures, and may then continue on to the major monastic universities located in Bangkok. The route of scholarship is also taken by monks who desire to rise in the ecclesiastic hierarchy, as promotions within the government-run system is contingent on passing examinations in Pāli and Dhamma studies. Monks who specialize in meditation typically seek out a known master in the meditation tradition, under whom they will study for a period of years. 'Meditation monks' are particularly revered in Thai society as possessing great virtue and as potential sources of supernatural powers. Ironically, monks of the Thai Forest Tradition often find themselves struggling to find time and privacy to meditate in the face of enthusiastic supporters seeking their blessings and attention. The Thai tradition supports laymen to go into a monastery, dress and act as monks, and study while there. The time line is based on threes, staying as a monk for three days, or three weeks, or three months or three years, or example of three weeks and three days. This retreat is expected of all male Thai, rich or poor, and often is scheduled after high school. Such retreat brings honor to the family and blessings (merit) to the young man. Thai make allowances for men who follow this practice, such as holding open a job. Reform movements. Position of women. Unlike in Myanmar (Burma) and Sri Lanka, the female Theravada bhikkhuni lineage was never established in Thailand. As a result, there is a widespread perception among Thais that women are not meant to play an active role in monastic life; instead, they are expected to live as lay followers, making merit in the hopes of being born in a different role in their next life. As a result, lay women primarily participate in religious life either as lay participants in collective merit-making rituals, or by doing domestic work around temples. A small number of women choose to become Mae Ji, non-ordained religious specialists who permanently observe either the eight or ten precepts. Mae Ji do not generally receive the level of support given to ordained monks, and their position in Thai society is the subject of some discussion. Recently, there have been efforts to attempt to introduce a bhikkhuni lineage in Thailand as a step towards improving the position of women in Thai Buddhism. The main proponent of this movement has been Dhammananda Bhikkhuni who is the Abbess of Wat Songdhammakalyani a temple that was founded by her mother, Venerable Voramai in the 1960s. Unlike similar efforts in Sri Lanka, these efforts have been extremely controversial in Thailand. Women attempting to ordain have been accused of attempting to impersonate monks (a civil offense in Thailand), and their actions have been denounced by many members of the ecclesiastic hierarchy. Most objections to the reintroduction of a female monastic role hinge on the fact that the monastic rules require that both five ordained monks and five ordained bhikkhunis be present for any new bhikkhuni ordination. Without such a quorum, critics say that it is not possible to ordain any new Theravada bhikkhuni. The Thai hierarchy refuses to recognize ordinations in the Taiwanese tradition (the only currently existing bhikkhuni ordination lineage) as valid Theravada ordinations, citing differences in philosophical teachings, and (more critically) monastic discipline.

The last new episode aired on Friday, May 28, 2010. The show featured many special guest stars which include Mike Epps, Cheryl Tiegs, Miley Cyrus, LL Cool J, Rihanna, Michael Rapaport, and Robbi Morgan. Overview. 2005–2009: Syndication. ""The Tyra Banks Show"" premiered on September 12, 2005 in front of a live-to-tape audience at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. In Summer 2007, the show moved to New York City, where it was filmed in the Chelsea Studios formerly occupied by Ricki Lake's program, being recorded in front of a live-to-tape audience at Chelsea Studios and Bankable Productions in New York City. The final five all-new episodes from Los Angeles were aired the week of September 3, 2007 and followed by the 3rd season premiere on following week, September 10, 2007 in New York City. The fourth season began on September 8, 2008. While Banks's show covered a variety of topics, there was a sensationalized focus on current issues facing women, with often special episodes on ""America's Next Top Model"", which Banks herself had also created and which she still hosts. The show was aired in many countries, and also remained available on XM Satellite Radio's Take Five channel in both the United States and Canada. In its later seasons, it took on a tabloid format similar to shows such as ""Maury"" and ""The Montel Williams Show"", covering topics such as people with odd psychological problems, among other subjects. On December 19, 2007, the show was renewed an additional two seasons in syndication, 2008–2009 and 2009–2010. However, in November 2008, Warner Bros. announced the program would move to The CW network's daytime block in September 2009, with both an archive episode and a first-run episode airing daily. As The CW was already airing ""ANTM"", network officials saw the move as a ""strategic alignment of interests for The CW's stations"", as both shows thus aired on the same channel nationwide.

wikipedia-2291934," The Diag  At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the Diag ( ) is a large open space in the middle of the university's Central Campus. Originally known as the Diagonal Green, the Diag derives its name from the many sidewalks running near or through it in diagonal directions. It is one of the busiest sites on the university campus, hosting a variety of events including outdoor concerts, fundraisers, demonstrations, and sun bathing. A brass block ""M"", a symbol of the university, is embedded at the center of the Diag. Local legend has it that if a UM student steps on the M before taking his or her first blue book exam at the university, the student will go on to fail that exam. The only way to reverse this ""curse"" was to run naked from the campus belltower during the strokes of midnight to two statues of pumas at the Natural Science Museum, then back to the tower before it stopped ringing. This has been made considerably more difficult in recent years as the belltower no longer rings at midnight. During the week before the annual football game against Michigan State University, members of the Theta Xi fraternity take turns guarding the inlaid ""M"" against vandalism by rival fans. A similar vigil takes place at Michigan State University known as ""Sparty Watch"" or ""Sparty Guard"" where members of the Spartan Marching Band guard the Sparty statue against vandalism. In April 2008, spring commencement ceremonies were held at the Diag for the first time in the university's 191-year history, as the traditional commencement ceremony location, Michigan Stadium, was undergoing construction. Rynearson Stadium, located at nearby Eastern Michigan University, was initially chosen by UM administration as the alternate commencement site, but a large volume of complaints led an alternate commencement site to be chosen, finally settling on the Diag. "
wikipedia-2291960," Count Five  The Count Five was a 1960s garage rock band from San Jose, California, best known for their Top 10 single ""Psychotic Reaction"". The band was founded in 1964 by John ""Mouse"" Michalski (born 1948, Cleveland, Ohio) (lead guitar) and Roy Chaney (born 1948, Indianapolis, Indiana) (bass guitar), two high school friends who had previously played in several short-lived bands. After going by the name The Squires for a short time, along with several line-up changes, the Count Five were born. John ""Sean"" Byrne (1947-2008, born Dublin, Ireland) played rhythm guitar and lead vocals, Kenn Ellner played tambourine and harmonica while sharing lead vocals and Craig ""Butch"" Atkinson (1947-1998, born San Jose, California) played drums. The Count Five gained distinction for their habit of wearing Count Dracula-style capes when playing live.  ""Psychotic Reaction"", an acknowledged cornerstone of garage rock, was initially devised by Byrne, with the group refining it and turning it into the highlight of their live sets. The song was influenced by the style of contemporary musicians such as The Standells and The Yardbirds. The band was rejected by several record labels before they got signed to the Los Angeles-based Double Shot Records. ""Psychotic Reaction"" was released as a single, peaking at #5 in the U.S. charts in late 1966. The band enjoyed limited success for a short time, dropping out of view altogether when their only hit had fallen from public memory. Another setback to a potential career in the music business was the decision of the five members (who were between the ages of 17 and 19) to pursue college degrees. By 1969, the Count Five had broken up, but their memory was immortalized in a 1972 essay by rock journalist Lester Bangs, entitled ""Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung."" In the essay, Bangs credited the band for having released several later albums (after ""Psychotic Reaction""): ""Carburetor Dung"", ""Cartesian Jetstream"", ""Ancient Lace and Wrought-Iron Railings"", and ""Snowflakes Falling On the International Dateline"" — each displaying an increasing sense of artistry and refinement. However none of these subsequent albums actually existed except in Bangs' own imagination. The Count Five reunited only once, when they performed a concert in 1987 at a club in Santa Clara, California called ""One Step Beyond"". This performance has been released as ""Psychotic Reunion LIVE!"".  The song ""Psychotic Reaction"" can be heard playing on the jukebox in an early scene in Wim Wenders' film ""Alice in the Cities"" (1974). Craig Atkinson died on October 13, 1998 and John ""Sean"" Byrne died on December 15, 2008 at 61 from cirrhosis of the liver. Roy Chaney formed a new band in the 1990s called The Count (with Byrne and drummer Rocco Astrella, who played in the last version of the original group). The Count released their debut CD, ""Can't Sleep"", in 2002. In 2006, Count Five was among the first bands inaugurated into the San Jose Rock Hall of Fame. Discography. Tracks: 01.

wikipedia-2291976," Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech  ""(I'm a) Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech"" is the fight song of the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech. The composition is based on ""Son of a Gambolier"", composed by Charles Ives in 1895, the lyrics of which are based on an old English and Scottish drinking song of the same name. It first appeared in print in the 1908 Blueprint, Georgia Tech's yearbook. The song was later sung by the Georgia Tech Glee Club on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1953, and by Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev during the 1959 Kitchen Debate. ""Ramblin' Wreck"" is played after every Georgia Tech score (directly after a field goal/safety) and preceded by ""Up With the White and Gold"" after a touchdown in an American football game, and frequently during timeouts at basketball games. The term ""Ramblin' Wreck"" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the Model A now known as the Ramblin' Wreck has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of South America. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as ""Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech."" Lyrics. I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech, and a hell of an engineer— A helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer. Like all the jolly good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear. I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer. Oh! If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in White and Gold, And put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold. But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you what he'd do— He would yell, 'To hell with Georgia!' like his daddy used to do. Oh, I wish I had a barrel of rum and sugar three thousand pounds, A college bell to put it in and a clapper to stir it round. I'd drink to all the good fellows who come from far and near. I'm a ramblin', gamblin', hell of an engineer! Previous adaptations. The earliest rendition of the song is ""Son of a Gambolier"" (also known as ""A Son of a Gambolier"" and ""The Son of a Gambolier""), which is a lament to one's own poverty; a gambolier is ""a worthless individual given to carousing, gambling, and general moral depravity."" The chorus goes: Like every jolly fellow I takes my whiskey clear, For I'm a rambling rake of poverty And the son of a gambolier. The tune was first adapted as a school song by Dickinson College in southern Pennsylvania in the 1850s. Students at the college modified it to include a reference to their college bell by adding the following lyrics: I wish I had a barrel of rum, And sugar three hundred pounds, The college bell to mix it in, The clapper to stir it round In 1857, the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity published a songbook that contained a heavily modified version of the song. The adapted chorus used the following lyrics: I'm a son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a DKE! I'm a son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a DKE! Like every college fellow, I like my whiskey free, For I'm a rambling rake of a college man, And the son of a DKE! The song was subsequently adapted by the Colorado School of Mines in the late 1870s and entitled ""The Mining Engineer."" This version is the closest adaptation to ""Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech."" Like every honest fellow, I take my whisky clear, I'm a rambling wreck from Golden Tech, a helluva engineer. The Mines version also includes: Oh, if I had a daughter I'd dress her up in green, And send her up to Boulder To coach the football team But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you what he'd do— He'd yell: 'TO HELL WITH BOULDER!' Like his daddy used to do. The song is also used by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, entitled ""Ramblin' Wreck"" although on campus it is referred to simply as the ""School Song."" This version is almost identical to the first four lines of ""Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech."" I'm a rambling wreck from Rapid Tech, and a helluva engineer. a helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer. Like all my jolly good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear, I'm a rambling wreck from Rapid Tech, and a helluva engineer. Hey! In the early 1890s, Ohio State University adapted it and called it ""If I had a Daughter"". At the time Ohio Wesleyan University was their arch rival, hence the references to Delaware, Ohio and Methodists. One verse follows: If I had a daughter, I'd dress her up in green, I'd send her on the campus to coach the Freshman team; And if I had a son, I tell you what he'd do He would yell ""To Hell"" with Delaware"" And yell for O. S. U. In 1895, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute adapted it and called it ""A Son of Old R.P.I."" This version includes the lyrics: Like every honest fellow, I drink my whiskey clear, I'm a moral wreck from the Polytech And a hell of an engineer. Two different sources are claimed to have been the origin for the song's music. The first is the marching tune ""The Bonnie Blue Flag"", published in 1861 by Harry McCarthy. The second, and more widely cited, is Charles Ives' composition of ""Son of a Gambolier"" in 1895. Creation at Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech's use of the song is said to have come from an early baseball game against rival Georgia. Some sources credit Billy Walthall, a member of the school's first four-year graduating class, with the lyrics. According to a 1954 article in Sports Illustrated, ""Ramblin' Wreck"" was written around 1893 by a Tech football player on his way to an Auburn game. In 1905, Georgia Tech adopted the tune as its official fight song, though it had already been the unofficial fight song for several years. It was published for the first time in the school's first yearbook, the 1908 Blueprint. Entitled ""What causes Whitlock to Blush"", words such as ""hell"" and ""helluva"" were censored as ""certain words too hot to print"". After Michael A. Greenblatt, Tech's first bandmaster, heard the Georgia Tech band playing the song to the tune of Charles Ives's ""A Son of a Gambolier"", he wrote a modern musical version. In 1911, Frank Roman succeeded Greenblatt as bandmaster; Roman embellished the song with trumpet flourishes and publicized it. Roman copyrighted the song in 1919. Rise to fame. In 1920, dance instructor Arthur Murray organized the world's first ""radio dance"" while he attended Tech. A band on campus played ""Ramblin' Wreck"" and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150 dancers (mostly Tech students) on the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta. Murray also opened the first Arthur Murray Dance Studio while in Atlanta. It was located at the Georgian Terrace Hotel. In 1925, the Columbia Gramophone Company began selling a recording of Tech songs (including ""Ramblin' Wreck""); Tech was one the first colleges in the Southern United States to have its songs recorded. The song became immensely popular and was known nationally because of its extensive radio play. In 1947, the song was performed by The Gordonaires in a Soundie entitled ""Let's Sing A College Song"". On October 11, 1953, the Georgia Tech Glee Club sang ""Ramblin' Wreck"" on Ed Sullivan's ""Toast of the Town"" program (later known as The Ed Sullivan Show) on CBS. The performance reached a television audience of approximately 30 million viewers. Because only 28 seats were available on the train to the show, Glee Club members auditioned for the available spots. The group prepared three songs—""Ramblin' Wreck,"" There's Nothin' Like a Dame, and the alma mater. Sullivan made them sing ""heck"" and ""heckuva"" instead of ""hell"" and ""helluva,"" and would not let them sing ""dames."" According to ""The Technique"", ""The club sang 'Dames' at rehearsal and brought down the house, only to have Sullivan give it the axe."" Then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev sang the song together when they met in Moscow in 1959 to reduce the tension between them during the Kitchen Debate. As the story goes, Nixon did not know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song as it had been sung on the Ed Sullivan show. ""Ramblin' Wreck"" has had many other notable moments in history, including being the first school song played in space. Gregory Peck sang the song while strumming a mandolin in the movie ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"". John Wayne whistled it in ""The High and the Mighty"". Tim Holt's character sings a few bars of it in the movie ""His Kind of Woman"". Gordon Jones sings a few stanzas several times in the movie ""My Sister Eileen"". There are numerous stories of commanding officers in Higgins boats crossing the English Channel on the morning of D-Day leading their men in the song to calm their nerves. Modern history. The Edwin H. Morris & Company obtained a copyright to Roman's version in 1931; that company was later acquired by Paul McCartney's holding company, MPL Communications in 1976. The copyright to that version expired in 1952, so Greenblatt wrote a new arrangement and applied for a new copyright. In 1953, Greenblatt sold the copyright for the new version to Georgia Tech for one dollar. There was some controversy when MPL Communications acquired the old copyright; a law firm commissioned by Georgia Tech in 1984, Newton, Hopkins & Ormsby, concluded that while there were copyrighted versions of the song, the version used by the school was not copyrighted and falls in the public domain. Over the years, a few variations of the song have been created at Georgia Tech. In 1998, a 19-member ""Diversity Task Force"" proposed that changes be made to the fight song because it discriminated against women. The proposal was widely and strongly opposed by students and alumni, and it was dropped. At the conclusion of the song there is a call of ""Go Jackets!"" responded to with ""Bust their ass!"" Following three of these calls and responses, the song was ended with a call of ""Go Jackets! Fight! Win!"" Recently, however, the student body has yelled ""Fight! Win! Drink! Get Naked!"" "
wikipedia-2292006," United States v. Virginia  United States v. Virginia, , is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Virginia Military Institute's long-standing male-only admission policy in a 7-1 decision. (Justice Clarence Thomas recused himself from the case, presumably because his son was enrolled at VMI at the time.) Decision and Rationale. Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated that because VMI failed to show ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for its sex-based admissions policy, it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. In an attempt to satisfy equal protection requirements, the state of Virginia had proposed a parallel program for women, called the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal arts women's college.  However, Justice Ginsburg held that the VWIL would not provide women with the same type of rigorous military training, facilities, courses, faculty, financial opportunities, and/or alumni reputation and connections that VMI affords male cadets, a decision evocative of ""Sweatt v. Painter"", when the Court ruled in 1950 that segregated law schools in Texas were unconstitutional, since a newly formed black law school clearly did not provide the same benefits to its students as the state's prestigious and long-maintained white law school. In her opinion, she stated that ""The VWIL program is a pale shadow of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence."" Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a concurrence agreeing to strike down the male-only admissions policy of the Virginia Military Institute, as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. However, he declined to join the majority opinion's basis for using the Fourteenth Amendment, writing: ""Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation."" This rationale supported separate but equal facilities separated on the basis of sex: ""it is not the 'exclusion of women' that violates the Equal Protection Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing any -- much less a comparable -- institution for women... It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall caliber."" Justice Scalia's lone dissent argued that the standard applied by the majority was closer to a strict scrutiny standard than the intermediate scrutiny standard applied to previous cases involving equal protection based on sex. Notably, however, the opinion for the Court eschewed either standard; its language did not comport with the ""important governmental interest"" formula used in prior intermediate scrutiny cases. Scalia argued that ""if the question of the applicable standard of review for sex-based classifications were to be regarded as an appropriate subject for reconsideration, the stronger argument would be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it to rational-basis review."" With the VMI decision, the high court effectively struck down any law which, as Justice Ginsburg wrote, ""denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature — equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society."" Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the 14th Amendment, and thus this ruling. The Department of Defense warned the school that it would withdraw all ROTC programs from the school if this privatization took place. As a result of the DOD action, Congress amended 10 USC 2111a, to prohibit the military from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six senior military colleges, including VMI. However, VMI's Board of Visitors had already voted 8-7 to admit women and did not revisit the issue after the law was amended. VMI was the last all-male public university in the United States. "
wikipedia-2277707," Mika Brzezinski  Mika Emilie Leonia Brzezinski (; born May 2, 1967) is an American television host and journalist. Brzezinski co-hosts MSNBC's weekday morning broadcast Morning Joe with former Republican representative Joe Scarborough. Early life. Brzezinski was born in New York City, the daughter of Polish-born foreign policy expert and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and Swiss-born sculptor Emilie Anna Benešová. Her mother, of Czech descent, is a grandniece of Czechoslovakia's former president Edvard Beneš. Her father was then teaching at Columbia University, but the family moved to McLean, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in late 1976, when Zbigniew was named National Security Advisor by newly elected President Jimmy Carter. Her brother, Mark Brzezinski, is an American diplomat and the current United States Ambassador to Sweden since 2011. Brzezinski attended The Madeira School during her high-school years. She graduated in 1989 from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where she majored in English, after transferring from Georgetown University as a junior. Career. Brzezinski began her journalism career as an assistant at ABC's ""World News This Morning"" in 1990. A year later, she moved to Tribune-owned Fox affiliate WTIC-TV/WTIC-DT in Hartford, Connecticut. There, she progressed from assignment and features editor to general assignments reporter. In 1992, she joined CBS affiliate WFSB-TV/WFSB-DT in Hartford and quickly progressed through the ranks to become its weekday morning anchor in 1995. In 1997, she left that role to join the CBS network news, where she served as a correspondent and as anchor for the overnight ""Up to the Minute"" news program. In 2000, Brzezinski began a short hiatus from CBS, during which she worked for rival MSNBC on the weekday afternoon show, ""HomePage,"" with co-anchors Gina Gaston and Ashleigh Banfield. ""Entertainment Weekly"" described the trio as ""the Powerpuff Girls of journalism"". She returned to CBS as a correspondent in September 2001, a move which thrust her into the limelight as a principal ""Ground Zero"" reporter for the September 11, 2001 attacks. Brzezinski was broadcasting live from the scene when the South Tower collapsed. (Coincidentally, her former MSNBC co-anchor, Ashleigh Banfield, was reporting from Ground Zero for MSNBC.) In her last position at CBS, Brzezinski served as a CBS News correspondent, substitute anchor, and segment anchor for breaking news segments and routine updates. During this period she became a frequent contributor to ""CBS Sunday Morning"" and ""60 Minutes."" She was subsequently fired by CBS. Brzezinski returned to MSNBC on January 26, 2007, doing the evening ""Up To The Minute"" news updates. Then she anchored primetime newsbreaks during the week, filling in on ""MSNBC Live"" weekdays and on the weekends. She also filed reports for NBC Nightly News and appeared as a news anchor on Weekend Today. Since the program's inception, Brzezinski has appeared as co-host and news reader on MSNBC's morning program ""Morning Joe"", alongside Joe Scarborough and Willie Geist. Her father is a frequent guest. On ""Morning Joe"", Brzezinski pointed out that she is a Democrat and her co-host Joe Scarborough is a Republican. Protesting trivial journalism. On June 26, 2007, near the beginning of ""Morning Joe"", Brzezinski refused to read a report about Paris Hilton's release from jail. One hour later during another news break segment, her producer Andy Jones again pushed the story as the lead, ranking it over Indiana's Republican Senator Richard Lugar's break with President Bush on the Iraq war, which Brzezinski considered more important. After several sarcastic remarks from host Joe Scarborough, she attempted to light the story's script on fire on the air, but was physically prevented from doing so by co-host Willie Geist. She then tore up the script, and one hour later, got up and ran another copy of the script through a paper shredder retrieved from Dan Abrams's office. The incident was quickly popularized on the Internet, and in the days that followed, Brzezinski received large quantities of fan mail supporting her on-air protest as a commentary on the tension between ""hard news"" and ""entertainment news"".  Similarly, on July 7, 2010, she spent significant airtime objecting to pressure to report on Lindsay Lohan and Levi Johnston, eventually having Geist or Pat Buchanan report the stories with the caption ""News You Can't Use"". In January 2011, she spent time on-air mentioning that it was not newsworthy to report on Sarah Palin's reaction to President Obama's speech about the Tucson shooting. Wage equality. On October 19, 2012, Brzezinski stated ""We've been talking a lot this week about women and equal pay and all these issues"". ""I have to say, in all seriousness, I'm very lucky to be working with you Joe Scarborough and for a company who has actually dealt with this problem transparently"", a reference to her satisfaction with her $2 million salary. ""All Things at Once"". Brzezinski authored the book, ""All Things at Once"", published by Weinstein Books in January 2010. The publisher describes it as ""a candid and inspiring motivational book that will help women of all ages confront the unique professional and personal challenges they face in the key moments of their lives."" In it she discussed her guilt over being preoccupied with work, which led to her dropping her baby down a flight of stairs.  ""Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You're Worth"". Brzezinski's most recent book, "" Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You're Worth"" (Weinstein Books 2011), includes tips for negotiating salaries and compensation packages. Told as her personal story, the advice and perspectives offered — both encouraging and cautionary — are substantiated with interviews and studies about commonly held perceptions of women who negotiate financial compensation. Personal life. Since 1993, Brzezinski is married to TV news reporter James Hoffer, now of WABC-TV. They met when both worked at WTIC-TV. They have two daughters. "
wikipedia-2277726," Bona fide purchaser  A ""bona fide"" purchaser (BFP)referred to more completely as a ""bona fide"" purchaser for value without notice is a term used in the law of real property and personal property to refer to an innocent party who purchases property without notice of any other party's claim to the title of that property. A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, recording one's interest protects an owner from losing that interest to a subsequent buyer who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, some jurisdictions (so-called ""race-notice"" jurisdictions) require the BFP himself or herself to record in order to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance. A BFP will not be bound by equitable interests of which he/she does not have actual or imputed notice, as long as he/she has made ""such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made"". BFPs are also sometimes referred to as ""Equity's Darling"". However, as Jeffrey Hackney has pointed out, the title is somewhat misleading; in cases where legal title is passed to a ""bona fide"" purchaser for value without notice, it is not so much that equity has any great affection for the purchaser - it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property. The relationship between the courts of equity and the BFP are better characterised as benign neglect. However, equity still undoubtedly recognises the right of the beneficial owner to claim against the former legal owner where the sale was improper. In the United States, the patent law codifies the ""bona fide"" purchaser rule, . Unlike the common law, the statute cuts off both equitable ""and"" legal claims to the title. "
wikipedia-2277747," Metal clay  Metal clay is a crafting medium consisting of very small particles of metal such as silver, gold, bronze, or copper mixed with an organic binder and water for use in making jewelry, beads and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any soft clay, by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a kiln, with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it. The binder burns away, leaving the pure sintered metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as bronze, sterling silver, and steel also are available. History. Metal clay first came out in Japan in 1990 to allow craft jewelry makers to make sophisticated looking jewelry without the years of study needed to make fine jewelry. Silver metal clay. Fine silver metal clay results in objects containing 99.9% pure silver, which is suitable for enameling. Although gold metal clay is more expensive, it provides richer color. Lump metal clay is sold in sealed packets to keep it moist and workable. The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre-filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS). Precious Metal Clay (PMC). PMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by metallurgist Masaki Morikawa. As a solid-phase sintered product of a precious metal powder used to form a precious metal article, the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold powder and a water-soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver.  The PMC brand includes the following products: Art Clay Silver (ACS). ACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8–10%. Further developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at , allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain. In 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22ct gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays. Lump metal clays. Lump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. Due to Hallmarking requirements laid out in the UK Bronze and Copper are not regarded as highly. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its PMC3 counterpart. Base metal clays. Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of copper by atmospheric oxygen. A simple means to accomplish this (place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container) was developed by Bill Struve. "

wikipedia-2277773," Removable partial denture  A removable partial denture (RPD) is for a partially edentulous dental patient who desires to have replacement teeth for functional or aesthetic reasons, and who cannot have a bridge (a fixed partial denture) for any number of reasons, such as a lack of required teeth to serve as support for a bridge (i.e. distal abutments) or due to financial limitations. The reason why this type of prosthesis is referred to as a ""removable partial denture"" is because patients can remove and reinsert them when required without professional help. Conversely, a ""fixed"" prosthesis can and should be removed only by a dental professional. Partially edentulous conditions. Depending on where in the mouth teeth are missing, edentulous situations can be grouped under four different categories, as defined by Dr. Edward Kennedy in his classification of partially edentulous arches. Kennedy Class I RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on both sides (left ""and"" right) in a single arch (either mandibular or maxillary), and there are no teeth posterior to the edentulous area. In other words, Class I RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, while replacing the missing posterior teeth on both sides with false denture teeth. The denture teeth are composed of either plastic or porcelain. Class II RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on one side (left ""or"" right) in a single arch, and there are no teeth behind the edentulous area. Thus, Class II RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, as well as on teeth that are more towards the back of the mouth of the side on which teeth are not missing, while replacing the missing more-back-of-the-mouth teeth on one side with false denture teeth. Class III RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some teeth such that the edentulous area has teeth remaining both posterior and anterior to it. Unlike Class I and Class II RPDs which are both tooth-and-tissue-borne (meaning they both clasp onto teeth, as well as rest on the posterior edentulous area for support), Class III RPDs are strictly tooth-borne, which means they only clasp onto teeth and do not need to rest on the tissue for added support. This makes Class III RPDs exceedingly more secure as per the three rules of removable prostheses that will be mentioned later, namely: support, stability and retention. (See the article on dentures for a more thorough review of these three fundamentals of removable prosthodontics.) However, if the edentulous area described in the previous paragraph crosses the anterior midline (that is, at least both central incisors are missing), the RPD is classified as a Class IV RPD. By definition, a Kennedy Class IV RPD design will possess only one edentulous area. Class I, II and III RPDs that have multiple edentulous areas in which replacement teeth are being placed are further classified with modification states that were defined by Oliver C. Applegate. Kennedy classification is governed by the most posterior edentulous area that is being restored. Thus, if, for example, a maxillary arch is missing teeth #1, 3, 7-10 and 16, the RPD would be Kennedy Class III mod 1. It would not be Class I, because missing third molars are generally not restored in an RPD (although if they were, the classification would indeed be Class I), and it would not be Class IV, because modification spaces are not allowed for Kennedy Class IV. Components of an RPD. Rather than lying entirely on the edentulous ridge like complete dentures, removable partial dentures possess clasps of metal or plastic that ""clip"" onto the remaining teeth, making the RPD more stable and retentive. The parts of an RPD can be listed as follows (and are exemplified by the picture above):  Clasp design. Direct retainers may come in various designs: Both cast circumferential and wrought wire clasps are ""suprabulge clasps"", in that they engage an undercut on the tooth by originating coronal to the height of contour, while Roach clasps are ""infrabulge clasps"" and engage undercuts by approaching from the gingival. In addition there are a couple of specific theories which include the clasp design: "
wikipedia-2277781," Maurice Binder  Maurice Binder (August 25, 1925 – April 4, 1991) was a film title designer best known for his work on 14 James Bond films including the first, ""Dr. No"" in 1962 and for Stanley Donen's films from 1958. He was born in New York City, USA, but mostly worked in Britain from the 1950s onwards. The Bond producers first approached him after being impressed by his title designs for the 1960 Stanley Donen comedy film ""The Grass Is Greener"". He also worked with Stanley Donen in ""Charade"" (1963) and ""Arabesque"" (1966), both with music of Henry Mancini. James Bond. Binder created the signature gun barrel sequence for the opening titles of the first Bond film, ""Dr. No"", in 1962. Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear. Binder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before his death in 1991: At least one critic has also observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). Binder is also best known for women performing a variety of activities such as dancing, jumping on a trampoline, or shooting weapons. Both sequences are trademarks and staples of the James Bond films. Maurice Binder was succeeded by Daniel Kleinman as the title designer for 1995's ""GoldenEye"".  Prior to ""GoldenEye"", the only James Bond movies for which he did not create the opening title credits were ""From Russia with Love"" (1963) and ""Goldfinger"" (1964), both of which were designed by Robert Brownjohn. Other sequences. Binder shot opening and closing sequences involving a mouse for ""The Mouse That Roared"" (1959), a sequence of monks filmed as a mosaic explaining the history of the Golden Bell in ""The Long Ships"" (1963), and a sequence of Spanish dancers explaining why the then topical reference of nuclear weapons vanishing in a B-52 mishap shifted from Spain to Greece in ""The Day the Fish Came Out"" (1967). He designed the title sequence for ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" (1963) that featured an orgy (the only one in the film). He took three days to direct the sequence that was originally supposed to take one day. Binder also was a producer of ""The Passage"" (1979), and a visual consultant on ""Dracula"" (1979) and ""Oxford Blues"" (1984). Death. Binder, who never married, died from lung cancer in London, aged 65. "
wikipedia-2277784," Equitable conversion  Equitable conversion is a doctrine of the law of real property under which a purchaser of real property becomes the equitable owner of title to the property at the time he/she signs a contract binding him/her to purchase the land at a later date. The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of conveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to the payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is then transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the contract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will nevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land. Such issues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who will bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction, but is the general rule. Effect of death of a party. If one of the parties dies after the contract for sale of the property has been executed, the doctrine will govern how that party's interest will pass to his heirs. For example, the seller wills his real property to his son, and his personal property to his daughter. If the seller dies after a contract for conveyance is signed by a buyer, the seller's interest in the land will be treated as personal property, and the proceeds of the sale will pass to his daughter. The State of New York does not recognize equitable conversion. In New York, as long as the buyer is without fault, the risk of loss remains on the seller until the buyer takes title or possession. Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act. A growing minority of States have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (UVPRA) in one form or another. The UVPRA negates the doctrine of Equitable Conversion as it relates to the risk associated with loss. The risk of loss is retained by the seller (Vendor/Grantor) under the UVPRA. Generally, the provisions of the UVPRA can be modified or avoided in the Land Sale Contract. "

wikipedia-2277871," Metastability in electronics  Metastability in electronics is the ability of a digital electronic system to persist for an unbounded time in an unstable equilibrium or metastable state. In metastable states, the circuit may be unable to settle into a stable '0' or '1' logic level within the time required for proper circuit operation. As a result, the circuit can act in unpredictable ways, and may lead to a system failure, sometimes referred to as a ""glitch"".  Metastable states are inherent features of asynchronous digital systems, and of systems with more than one independent clock domain. In self-timed asynchronous systems, arbiters are designed to allow the system to proceed only after the metastability has resolved, so the metastability is a normal condition, not an error condition. In synchronous systems with asynchronous inputs, synchronizers are designed to make the probability of a synchronization failure acceptably small.  Metastable states are avoidable in fully synchronous systems when the input setup and hold time requirements on flip-flops are satisfied. Arbiters. In electronics, an ""arbiter"" is a circuit designed to determine which of several signals arrive first. Arbiters are used in asynchronous circuits to order computational activities for shared resources to prevent concurrent incorrect operations. Arbiters are used on the inputs of fully synchronous systems, and also between clock domains, as synchronizers for input signals. Although they can minimize the occurrence of metastability to very low probabilities, all arbiters nevertheless have metastable states, which are unavoidable at the boundaries of regions of the input state space resulting in different outputs. Synchronous circuits. Synchronous circuit design techniques make digital circuits that are resistant to the failure modes that can be caused by metastability. A ""clock domain"" is defined as a group of flip-flops with a common clock. Such architectures can form a circuit guaranteed free of metastability (below a certain maximum clock frequency, above which first metastability, then outright failure occur), assuming a low-skew common clock. However, even then, if the system has a dependence on any continuous inputs then these are likely to be vulnerable to metastable states. When synchronous design techniques are used, protection against metastable events causing systems failures need only be provided when transferring data between different clock domains or from an unclocked region into the synchronous system. This protection can often take the form of a series of delay flip-flops which delay the data stream long enough for the metastability to have statistically been removed. Failure modes. Although metastability is well understood and architectural techniques to control it are known, it persists as a failure mode in equipment. Serious computer and digital hardware bugs caused by metastability have a fascinating social history. Many engineers have refused to believe that a bistable device can enter into a state that is neither ""true"" nor ""false"" and has a positive probability that it will remain indefinite for any given period of time, albeit with exponentially decreasing probability over time. However, metastability is an inevitable result of any attempt to map a continuous domain to a discrete one. There will always be points in the continuous domain which are equidistant (or nearly so) from the points of the discrete domain, making a decision as to which discrete point to select a difficult and potentially lengthy process. If the inputs to an arbiter or flip-flop arrive almost simultaneously, the circuit most likely will traverse a point of metastability. Metastability remains poorly understood in some circles, and various engineers have proposed their own circuits said to solve or filter out the metastability; typically these circuits simply shift the occurrence of metastability from one place to another. Chips using multiple clock sources are often tested with tester clocks that have fixed phase relationships, not the independent clocks drifting past each other that will be experienced during operation. This usually explicitly prevents the metastable failure mode that will occur in the field from being seen or reported. Current engineering solutions to this problem are often the well-characterized, multi-stage common-clock shift registers discussed in the links below. "
wikipedia-2277940," Rawtenstall  Rawtenstall ( or ) is a town at the centre of the Rossendale Valley, in Lancashire, England. It is the seat for the Borough of Rossendale, in which it is located. The town lies 17.4 miles north of Manchester, 22 miles east of Preston and 45 miles south east of the county town of Lancaster. Nearby towns include Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom. History. The name Rawtenstall has been given two possible interpretations. The older is a combination of the Middle English ""routen"" ('to roar or bellow'), from the Old Norse ""rauta"" and the Old English stall 'pool in a river' (Ekwall 1922, 92). The second, more recent one, relates to Rawtenstall's identification as a cattle farm in 1324 and combines the Old English ""ruh"" 'rough' and ""tun-stall"" 'the site of a farm' (Mills 1991, 269), or possibly, 'buildings occupied when cattle were pastured on high ground' (Mills 1976, 125). The earliest settlement at Rawtenstall was probably in the early medieval period, during the time when it formed part of the Forest of Rossendale in the Honour of Clitheroe, and consisted of simple dwellings for forest servants and animals. More substantial buildings may have followed in the 15th and 16th centuries with corn and flour mills. The town entered a major period of growth during the Industrial Revolution, as new mills were constructed to process cotton. The climate and weather were conducive to the industry, as was the town's nearby location to the rapidly developing industrial and mercantile centre at Manchester, dubbed 'Cottonopolis'. Only a few of these mills survive today, and none are still operational. During this period, David Whitehead and his brother became important entrepreneurs in the town. They built a number of mills, including one of the earliest mills in the valley, at Lower Mill, and the still existing Ilex Mill. They also built substantial houses for themselves at Holly Mount, as well as large numbers of terraced houses for their workers. The population of Rawtenstall quadrupled in the first half of the 19th century and would double again in the second half. Other industries active in this period included quarrying and small scale coalmining, as well as an expanding commercial sector. As with many small mid-Lancashire towns, it saw a population decline in the 20th century, going from 30,000 inhabitants in the 1911 census to 21,500 in the 1971 census. With the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries, shoemaking became one of the last survivors. The firm of H. W. Tricketts, in nearby Waterfoot, had been a major producer and exporter of footwear across the British Empire, but eventually the last shoemaking firms closed as production moved overseas. Governance. A local board was formed for the town in 1874 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Lower Booths (Rawtenstall itself), Higher Booths, Newchurch and Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley and Cowpe, Lench, Newhall Hey and Hall Carr, and part of Tottington (Higher End) in the ancient parish of Bury. Subsequently Rawtenstall was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891 and in 1894 a civil parish was created to match the borders of the borough. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 Rawtenstall became part of the Borough of Rossendale. Rawtenstall is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, after the constituency of Rossendale was abolished in 1983. The constituency sends one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons. As of June 2009, both Lancashire County Council and the local council, Rossendale Borough Council, are controlled by the Conservative Party. Jake Berry MP has been the Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010. Geography. Its neighbouring communities in the valley are Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom. The area is bounded to the north by Loveclough and Whitewell Bottom, to the east by Waterfoot and Cowpe and to the south by Townsend Fold and Horncliffe. The River Irwell passes through the town on the first part of its route between Bacup and Manchester. Over recent years the area has become increasingly popular with visitors, attracted by historic buildings, dramatic landscapes and fine walking country. Climate. Like most of the United Kingdom, Rawtenstall has an oceanic climate. Transport. The town is served locally by Rossendale Transport, with a large bus station close to the centre, as well as frequent express services X43 and X44 to Burnley, Nelson and Manchester run by Transdev Burnley & Pendle. The town has had bus routes since the early 1930s. Lancashire and Rossendale are planning to replace the station with a modern bus interchange. In 2007 a proposal to demolish the station and build a Lidl store on the site was considered. The new Lidl store was completed in 2009. Rawtenstall railway station also serves the town, but since the closure of the main line to Manchester, it now operates mainly as a tourist route, as part of the East Lancashire Railway, of which Rawtenstall station forms the northern terminus. The M66 motorway from Manchester is linked to Rawtenstall via the A56 bypass, allowing for a driving time between Manchester and Rawtenstall of around half an hour. Education. The town has a number of primary and secondary (high) schools, including Alder Grange Community and Technology School and All Saints Catholic Language College. Though located in Waterfoot, rather than Rawtenstall, the traditional grammar school, Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School takes part of its name from the town. Rawtenstall also has a public library, built in 1906 with Carnegie funding. Culture and community. The Rossendale Valley's local newspaper, the ""Rossendale Free Press"" was originally based here, before being bought out by M.E.N Media in 2009 and subsequently moving to Manchester. Rawtenstall also has one of the largest indoor markets in Rossendale (a sign declaring it to be ""probably the friendliest market in the world""), which suffered a serious arson attack in March 2011.  It was home to the North of England's largest dry ski-slope, before it was closed due to funding cuts. ""Ski Rossendale"" was located five minutes from Rawtenstall town centre in the Oakenhead area, directly above Whitaker Park and Rossendale Museum. Over its 40 year existence it had seen world record attempts and was used by Olympic athletes and novice skiers. It re-opened once again in November 2011 with new funding, with a large ceremonial fireworks display on its opening day, Bonfire Night. It is also home to the traditional herbalist and temperance bar Fitzpatrick's Herbal Health, who claim to be the oldest brewers of sarsaparilla and dandelion and burdock in the country. Fitzpatrick's gained television acclaim in April 2005 when managers Gareth ""G"" Hawden and Chris Law won The Famous Sarsaparilla taste-off on ITV. It is the last bar of its kind in the country of England.  Famous fashion boutique Sunday Best is situated on Bank Street. Sunday Best won the Daily Telegraph magazines best shop in Britain award for women's fashion in 2011 whilst Roland's Florist on Bacup road was runner up in the best Florist category. The awards were judged by TV shopping guru Mary Portas. Rawtenstall Cricket Club, who compete in the Lancashire League, have their home ground, Worswick Memorial Ground within the town. Police facilities in Rawtenstall were one of five sites used for the training of new recruits to the Lancashire Constabulary. In late 2011, due to funding cuts, Rawtenstall police station, along with various other stations in the area, closed down. Rawtenstall is also the location of the area's county and magistrates' courts.  Whitaker Park is located on the outskirts of the town centre, and consists of the former house of the mill owner George Hardman, set in extensive landscaped grounds. Donated to the township in the early 20th century for the purposes of civic recreation, the house now contains The Whitaker which is Rossendale's Museum and Art Gallery, whilst the gardens and surrounding land are laid out as a public park. The museum contains exhibits of local history, or displays of the house as it was originally. Part of it houses an extensive exhibition of taxidermy, whilst other areas are used to display contemporary art. The park itself has tennis courts, a bowling green, basketball court, a skateboard area and a playground as well as formal gardens and fountains. Other. Rawtenstall was featured in the television programme ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" which was aired on BBC2 at 9PM on 2 February 2006. The subject, actress Jane Horrocks, was born in Rawtenstall in 1964. The Irwell Sculpture Trail also runs through the town, where four of the sculptures are located; the Whispering Wall, the Gateway, the Willow Tree and the Bocholt Tree. The last, by sculptor Bernard Tindall, celebrates Rossendale's twinning links with the town of Bocholt, Germany. The ""Shoe Trail"" also hits the outskirts of the town, and goes through nearly places such as Whitaker park. Rawtenstall's shopping centre had become deserted and boarded-up, and after 2003 various proposals were put forward regarding reconstruction or refurbishment. An agreement between Rossendale Council and the owners of the Rawtenstall centre, Ashcap, in February 2011, was said to ""improve Rawtenstall town centre"". In late 2011 the Shopping Centre was demolished, creating a new town square area, where local markets and other events are infrequently held. Rossendale Council funded the demolition using money set aside for a public pool in neighbouring town Haslingden. This move was slammed by critics and the local papers. In 1993 the first professional beauty salon in Rawtenstall opened in Ormerod Street and still trades today as Polished Beauty Clinic. Notable people. The historian and antiquarian George Ormerod lived in Rawtenstall for a brief period in 1808. "
wikipedia-2277971," Raa Atoll  Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll or Raa Atoll is an administrative division from the Maldives. The capital is Ungoofaaru. It includes Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll proper and the island of Alifushi. 1. Alifushi and Etthingili (Powell Islands in the Admiralty Chart) stand on a detached reef of their own with very deep waters (no sounding) between this ""faru"" and the northern end of the main atoll. 2. Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll is in length from N to S, and across at its broadest part. Its western fringe is composed of a series of round or oval reefs ""(farus)"" irregularly placed (a feature peculiar to all the larger Northern Atolls). The centre is heavily dotted with coral patches (""giri""), some submerged and some awash. The concentration of ""giri"" is especially dense towards its SW quarter, close to Kandholhudhu Island (where there is the place most crowded with small reefs and shoals in the whole Maldives), but its narrower northern end is quite clear of reefs. The general depths of the lagoon are from . The capital of Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll is Ungoofaaru. Recently, the island has been reclaimed up to the edge of the reef in order to provide land for social and economic activities for the growing population. NOTE: ""Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).""  Alifushi, located at the northern end of the atoll, is an island which has been traditionally famous for its skilled boatbuilding carpenters. It now houses shipyards. Moresby Channel (Hanikandu). Hanikandu is the channel between Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll and ""Fasdhūtere"" Atoll, beyond its southern border. This channel is also known as Moresby Channel in the honor of Robert Moresby, an almost forgotten captain and draughtsman, who with much patience and hard work charted all the Atolls of the Maldives. Tourism. Formerly this atoll was off-limits for tourists, but since the late 1990s there was a change in government policy. The main tourist resort island on Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll is Meedhupparu. "
wikipedia-2277981," Cranberry sauce  Cranberry sauce or cranberry jelly is a sauce or relish made out of cranberries, commonly associated with Thanksgiving dinner in North America and Christmas dinner in the United Kingdom. There are differences in flavor depending on the geography of where the sauce is made: in Europe it is generally slightly sour-tasting, while in North America it is sweetened. The most basic cranberry sauce consists of cranberries boiled in sugar water until the berries pop and the mixture thickens. Some recipes include other ingredients such as slivered almonds, orange juice, zest, ginger, maple syrup, port, or cinnamon. Commercial cranberry sauce may be loose and uncondensed, or condensed or jellied. The jellied form may be slipped out of a can onto a dish, and served sliced or intact for slicing at the table. Cranberry sauce is often eaten in conjunction with turkey for Christmas or Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada, and it is only rarely eaten or served in other contexts there. Some commercial brands of cranberry sauce may not be appropriate for vegetarians as they may contain gelatin. "
wikipedia-2278033," Anna Nagar  Anna Nagar (formerly known as Naduvakkarai), is a neighbourhood in the metropolitan city of Chennai, India. Named after the Tamil leader C. N. Annadurai, it is located in the north-western part of Chennai and forms a part of Egmore-Nungambakkam taluk. It is one of the prime residential areas in Chennai. Anna Nagar was developed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board in the early 1970s following the World Trade Fair in the area in 1968. The board developed residential plots, apartments, commercial complexes, wide roads, school zones, bus terminus and large parks. The roads in Anna Nagar are designed based on matrix structure similar to roads in developed countries in the western world; all the roads are laid parallel and perpendicular to each other. In addition, a standardized naming nomenclature is adopted. In Anna Nagar, 2nd, 4th and 6th Avenues run East-West and 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th Avenues run North South. All the streets are interconnected to these avenues. Anna Nagar is the first township and the only township in Chennai to follow standard addressing system followed in the western world. Areas expanded after the formation of the initial 1970 layouts do not follow the standard nomenclature. One of the main attractions in Anna Nagar is the Annanagar Tower. Other important landmarks include the Anna Arch, Chinthamani, Blue Star, 14 shops, Thirumangalam junction, Anna Nagar East, and Anna Nagar West bus depot. Anna Nagar has a number of well established schools and colleges, places of worship, shopping areas with both independent shops and chain stores and numerous restaurants. 2009 also saw the opening of a McDonalds and a KFC outlet, both on the busy 2nd Avenue. There are also a number of mid size hospitals and nursing homes catering to the local population. History. Anna Nagar originated as a suburban village called Naduvakkarai. It was called Mullam Village and is still referred to like that by the Land and revenue department for all official purposes. Anna arch. A large twin arch called the Anna arch marks the entrance of the southern part of Anna Nagar on the Third Avenue, which was built in 1985 by the Corporation of Chennai at a cost of 1.2 million to commemorate the platinum jubilee celebrations of former chief minister C. N. Annadurai, when Anna Nagar was still a developing area. It was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran on 1 January 1986. Each arch stands 52 ft tall and weighs 82 tonnes. The road from the arch leads to the Round Tana (roundabout) which is a major landmark and for all practical purposes, the centre of Anna Nagar. In 2012, the arch was proposed to be demolished to leave way for a flyover that was planned to connect Anna Nagar with Aminjikarai. Demolition work began on 2 September 2012. However, the alignment of the flyover was modified slightly to prevent the removal of the arch, and the arch was restored at a cost of 6.4 million. Shanthi Colony and its Neighborhoods in Anna Nagar. Shanthi Colony - Initially developed by TNHB as a residential colony and is located in 4th Avenue.

For a nominal fee one can walk to the top of the tower from where excellent views of the city can be seen. The tower and park are now renovated and has a skating rink. Currently, it boasts of a good turnout of children who come in for practising their skills on roller skates. There is also a group of regulars who practice silambattam - an ancient Tamil martial art form - here. From atop the tower one can have a panoramic views, and the rapidly changing skyline of the city can be appreciated. Anna Nagar Roundtana. The famous Anna Nagar Roundtana located at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue is a sprawling and burgeoning high-scale commercial neighborhood. This was initially developed for the Madras EXPO during the 1970s and was named ""Round Turn Over"", whose name has colloquially changed to ""Roundtana"" with the use of Tamil Language. Bus Terminus. Anna Nagar has two bus terminuses. One is Anna Nagar West and another is Anna Nagar East. Anna Nagar East terminus is located near Anna Nagar Roundtana while the Anna Nagar West Terminus is situated on the hundred feet road.

wikipedia-2278099," Faye Emerson  Faye Margaret Emerson (July 8, 1917 – March 9, 1983) was an American film actress and television interviewer known as ""The First Lady of Television."" Beginning in 1941, she acted in many Warner Brothers films. In 1944, she played one of her more memorable roles as Zachary Scott's former wife in ""The Mask of Dimitrios."" She was also notable for being the third wife of presidential son Elliott Roosevelt from 1944 to 1950. Early life. Emerson was born to Lawrence and Emma (Smythe) in the tiny community of Elizabeth in Allen Parish in southwestern Louisiana. She moved with her mother to San Diego before the war. There she took up acting and by 1940 was a Hollywood starlet. Career. In 1948, she made a move to television and began acting in various anthology series, including ""The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre"", ""The Philco Television Playhouse"", and ""Goodyear Television Playhouse"". She served as host for several short-lived talk shows and musical/variety shows, including ""Paris Cavalcade of Fashions"" (1948) and ""The Faye Emerson Show"" (CBS, 1950).  Although ""The Faye Emerson Show"" only lasted one season, it gave her wide exposure because her time slot immediately followed the ""CBS Evening News"" and alternated weeknights with the popular ""The Perry Como Show"". According to author Gabe Essoe in ""The Book of TV Lists,"" on one of the show's segments, her low-cut gown slipped and ""she exposed her ample self coast to coast."" The show was broadcast from a studio CBS built on the sixth floor of the Stork Club building. The studio, a complete replica of the Stork Club's Cub Room, was built for ""The Stork Club"", also seen on CBS beginning in 1950. After ""The Faye Emerson Show"", she continued in TV with other talk shows, including ""Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town"" (1951-1952), ""Author Meets the Critics"" (1952), and ""Faye and Skitch"" (1953). She also made numerous guest appearances on various variety shows and game shows. Emerson hosted or appeared on so many talk shows—usually wearing evening gowns—and game shows, such as ""I've Got a Secret"", that she was known as ""The First Lady of Television."" The glamorous Emerson was so popular in the early 1950s that it was rumored that the newly created Emmy Award was named after her. Marriages. Faye Emerson married her first husband, William Crawford, a naval aviator, in 1938. However, Faye's activities in the movie industry were not conducive to a stable marriage, and though it produced one son, William Crawford, Jr., the marriage was over by the time Faye met President Franklin D. Roosevelt's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, in August 1943. Howard Hughes was instrumental in bringing the two together when Colonel Roosevelt visited the Hughes Aircraft Company to evaluate the proposed Hughes XF-11. Though Elliott was married, Faye and he linked up, strongly urged on by the generous efforts of Hughes and his social facilitator, Johnny Meyer. Faye later asserted that despite her doubts, Hughes urged her to advance the relationship, and she knew that she could not defy Hughes. In December 1944, Hughes and Meyer provided the funding and airplanes for Faye's and Elliott's well-publicized marriage at the rim of the Grand Canyon. When Elliott went back to Europe, he named his reconnaissance aircraft ""My Faye."" The intelligent and mannered Faye was very popular in the White House, and kept up a warm connection with Eleanor Roosevelt and the rest of the family even after her split with Elliott. After some months in Beverly Hills in 1945, the couple resided with Eleanor Roosevelt at Hyde Park, N.Y. They had no children. The marriage began breaking up by 1947. In December 1948, Faye Emerson slit her wrists and was briefly hospitalized. In January 1950, Faye obtained a divorce in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Next year, she married band leader and conductor Lyle ""Skitch"" Henderson in the same town, and after Skitch got into some problems, divorced him in 1957 in Acapulco, Mexico. Former brother-in-law James Roosevelt wrote that ""after an incident involving some teen-age girls he (Skitch) was dropped from Johnny Carson's ""Tonight"" TV show and his career went into eclipse. Faye's marriage to Skitch hit the skids. She didn't have much luck in her married life, but she endures, and we think of her fondly."" Retirement and Death. Once a Hollywood starlet enjoying the show business spotlight, the wealthy Emerson moved to Spain and spent the rest of her life in seclusion. She died in 1983 at the age of sixty-five of stomach cancer in Deià, Majorca, a village favored by retired artists and entertainers. For years she lived there with Anne Roosevelt, the divorced first wife of Elliott's brother John Aspinwall Roosevelt. "
wikipedia-2278111," Potamogeton  Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (""Elodea canadensis""). The genus name means ""river neighbor"", originating from the Greek ""potamos"" (river) and ""geiton"" (neighbor). Morphology. ""Potamogeton"" species may be large or very small. Plants are sometimes annuals but are often perennial and typically produce rhizomes which are the common over-wintering form. Many species also produced specialised overwintering buds called turions which may be borne on the rhizome, on the stem or on stolons from the rhizome. The leaves are alternate, which contrasts with the closely related genus ""Groenlandia"" where the leaves are opposite or whorled. In many species, all the leaves are submerged and in these cases the leaves are typically thin and translucent. Some species, especially in ponds and very slow moving waters, have floating leaves which tend to be more leathery. Diagnostic of most species of ""Potamogeton"" is the presence of a delicate membranous sheathing scale at the leaf axil. This may be wholly attached, partly attached or free of the leaf and it may have inrolled margins or appear as a tube. The flowers, which are often overlooked are composed of 4 rounded segments borne in a spike. Taxonomy. ""Potamogeton"" species are found throughout the world where there is standing or running water. There are estimated to be around 90 species but hybridisation provides an added complexity to the taxonomy. At least 26 hybrids have been observed in the British Isles alone. An account of ""Potamogeton"" hybrids was currently revised, listing genetically confirmed 36 hybrids in the world. History. Alfred Fryer became interested in ""Potamogeton"" in the 1880s, and was a recognised authority on the genus. The first parts of his work ""The Potamogetons (Pond Weeds) of the British Isles"" were published in 1898. His death intervened, and the work was completed by Arthur Bennett (1843-1929). Robert Morgan (1863-1900) illustrated Fryer's contribution to the monograph, his colour plates drawing praise from later critics. Ecology. ""Potamogeton"" species are found worldwide in many aquatic ecosystems. They are important as food and habitat for animals. Most species are not weedy, but a few can become troublesome, such as curly-leaf pondweed (""Potamogeton crispus""). "
wikipedia-2278116," Special right triangles  A special right triangle is a right triangle with some regular feature that makes calculations on the triangle easier, or for which simple formulas exist. For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45–45–90. This is called an ""angle-based"" right triangle. A ""side-based"" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of whole numbers, such as 3 : 4 : 5, or of other special numbers such as the golden ratio. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods. Angle-based. ""Angle-based"" special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles. The side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the unit circle or other geometric methods. This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°. Special triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below: The 45–45–90 triangle, the 30–60–90 triangle, and the equilateral/equiangular (60–60–60) triangle are the three Möbius triangles in the plane, meaning that they tessellate the plane via reflections in their sides; see Triangle group.  45–45–90 triangle. In plane geometry, constructing the diagonal of a square results in a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 1 : 2, adding up to 180° or π radians. Hence, the angles respectively measure 45° (π/4), 45° (π/4), and 90° (π/2). The sides in this triangle are in the ratio 1 : 1 : √2, which follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem. Triangles with these angles are the only possible right triangles that are also isosceles triangles in Euclidean geometry. However, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, there are infinitely many different shapes of right isosceles triangles. 30–60–90 triangle. This is a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 and respectively measure 30°, 60°, and 90°. The sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The proof of this fact is clear using trigonometry. The geometric proof is: The 30-60-90 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if α, α+δ, α+2δ are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles 3α+3δ = 180°. So one angle must be 60° the other 90° leaving the remaining angle to be 30°. Right triangle whose angles are in a geometric progression. The 30–60–90 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. There is also a unique right triangle whose angles are in a geometric progression. The three angles are π/(2""φ""2), π/(2""φ""), π/2 where the common ratio is ""φ"", the golden ratio. Consequently the angles are in the ratio formula_1 Based on the sine rule, the sides are in the ratio formula_2 Because the sides are subject to the Pythagorean theorem, then formula_3 and this resolves to the identity Interestingly by using the exponential definition of cosine, this can now be expanded into a phi identity that uses ""φ"" and the five fundamental mathematical constants π, e, i, 1, 0 of Euler's identity (though not as elegantly as the latter) as follows: Side-based. Right triangles whose sides are of integer lengths, Pythagorean triples, possess angles that are never rational numbers of degrees. They are most useful in that they may be easily remembered and any multiple of the sides produces the same relationship. Using Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples, the sides must be in the ratio where ""m"" and ""n"" are any positive integers such that ""m"">""n"". Common Pythagorean triples. There are several Pythagorean triples which are well-known, including those with sides in the ratios: The 3 : 4 : 5 triangles are the only right triangles with edges in arithmetic progression. Triangles based on Pythagorean triples are Heronian, meaning they have integer area as well as integer sides. The following are all the Pythagorean triple ratios expressed in lowest form (beyond the five smallest ones, listed above) with both non-hypotenuse sides less than 256:  Almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples. Isosceles right-angled triangles cannot have sides with integer values. However, infinitely many ""almost-isosceles"" right triangles do exist. These are right-angled triangles with integral sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse edges differ by one. Such almost-isosceles right-angled triangles can be obtained recursively, ""a""""n"" is length of hypotenuse, ""n"" = 1, 2, 3, ... Equivalently, where {""x, y""} are the solutions to the Pell equation formula_8, with the hypotenuse ""y"" being the odd terms of the Pell numbers 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378... .. The smallest Pythagorean triples resulting are: Alternatively, the same triangles can be derived from the square triangular numbers. Right triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression. The Kepler triangle is a right triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression. If the sides are formed from the geometric progression ""a, ar, ar""2 then its common ratio ""r"" is given by ""r"" = √""φ"" where ""φ"" is the golden ratio. Its sides are therefore in the ratio formula_9 "
wikipedia-2278161," Pável Pardo  Pável Pardo Segura (born 26 July 1976) is a retired Mexican international footballer who last played with the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer. Pardo spent most of his career playing with Club América and is the second most capped player in Mexico national team history. Pardo participated in two World Cups (1998 and 2006), won two CONCACAF Gold Cups and won the FIFA Confederations Cup with Mexico in 1999. Biography. Pardo started his career in 1993 with Atlas de Guadalajara, and also played with Tecos UAG before joining América. A veteran of 467 games with 35 goals at club level and 139 international caps, scoring 10 goals. He is regarded as one of the best players in Mexico, having achieved great success with Club América, winning both the Mexican ""Torneo de Verano"" 2002, ""Torneo de Clausura"" in 2005 and the CONCACAF Champions Cup tournament in 2006. After participating with Mexico in high profile tournaments, namely the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, both of which were held in Germany, Pardo began to attract attention from a number of international clubs. Rumors linked him with CA River Plate of Argentina and Recreativo Huelva of Spain. Pardo was unable to reach an agreement with either club. Following the World Cup, Pardo joined VfB Stuttgart, for a sum of one million euros, the same club that purchased Pardo's national teammate, Ricardo Osorio. Pardo scored his first goal for Stuttgart in a 16 September 2006 league contest and win against Werder Bremen. On 19 May 2007, Stuttgart won the Bundesliga with Pardo, who appeared in 33 complete games, serving as one of the pillars of the team. He was voted the fifth-best player in his first season in Germany. In January 2009, he returned to Club América for a fee of US $600,000. In July 2011, Pardo revealed he would be signing with a Major League Soccer team after America allowed him to terminate his contract with them and thus sign on a free transfer with MLS, and signed with the Chicago Fire on 26 July 2011. Pardo re-signed with Chicago for the 2012 season on 18 January 2012. On 19 January 2013, Pardo announced his retirement. International. Pardo made his international debut for Mexico in 1996, playing in the U.S. Cup tournament, against the USA. Since then, Pardo has captained his country in several occasions and played important roles for the national team for many years, helping his country to winning the 1998 and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments and the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. He played in France 98, as well as the 1997 Copa América and 1999 and the mentioned 2005 Confederations Cup and 2006 World Cup. At the 1998 World Cup, Pardo was sent off in the match between Belgium and Mexico. Referee Hugh Dallas was criticised for his actions during the game after he also sent off team mate Gert Verheyen.  On 21 June 2007, he played in the 2007 Gold Cup, helping Mexico earn second place. The day after the game he announced that he would not go to 2007 Copa América because he needed some rest. The national side eventually ended up in third place in that tournament. In the 2007–08 season, his second year in Stuttgart, he established himself as one of the leading players, due to his constant and solid performances and also because, at 32, he was one of the older players in the otherwise young ""VfB"" side. Therefore, he earned the nickname ""el comandante"" or ""el jefe"" in the team. On 20 August 2008, he helped Mexico to a 2–1 win over Honduras at home in their first World Cup qualifier match at Estadio Azteca, scoring a brace in the 72nd and 75th minute respectively after trailing 1–0. He was called up to play again against Honduras after missing the squad due to injury or call-ups from VfB Stuttgart. Statistics. Career statistics. ""As of 4 November 2012"" "
wikipedia-2278187," Miracle Landing  Miracle Landing is a 1990 television film based on an in-flight accident aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 that occurred in April 1988. The Boeing 737-200 was flying from Hilo, Hawaii to Honolulu, Hawaii, when it experienced rapid decompression when a section of the fuselage was torn away. With one person blown from the cabin and dozens injured, the aircraft was able to make a successful emergency landing at Kahului Airport, on Maui. The film aired on the United States television network, CBS in early 1990 and has since been shown on networks throughout the world in syndication. Plot. The story begins in February 1988, in a flight simulator with two pilots facing the challenge of landing a crippled jet that experiences a cabin decompression, an engine fire and a loss of hydraulics. The three emergency situations foreshadow the events of Paradise Airlines Flight 243, taking place two months later. The story follows three crew members. Paradise Airlines 243 is an inter-island flight from Honolulu to Hilo, with a return to Honolulu the same day. The characters are developed during several scenes set during the layover, and passengers are introduced to the audience during check-in scenes. The flight then takes off over Hilo, and soon beverage service begins. During that time nothing out of the ordinary occurs, but soon after David - a young boy travelling with his mother - calls the lead flight attendant, C.B. and asks her about the crack appearing in the ceiling. At that moment, chaos breaks loose and the entire front and top half section of the plane apart from the cockpit and cargo hold, blows off in a clean cut. In the mess, Michelle falls to the floor and clings to a passenger's seat, C.B. is blown from the aircraft, and passengers are badly injured from debris and decompression. The third flight attendant Jane sustains serious head injuries, is thrown to the ground and clings to life and to other passengers to avoid the same fate as C.B. The cockpit is unaware of the full scale of the disaster and believe a bomb or decompression has occurred. Soon passengers seated in the section that was not swept away have oxygen masks fall but it is useless as all the lines were destroyed. However, the plane was at a low altitude thus it hadn't affected them as badly. Mimi and Bob contact Kahului Airport to declare an emergency. Soon, the pilots are faced with the fact they may crash and passengers would die, and both Mimi and Bob have flashbacks to her training days and his Air Force, respectively. Michelle has a flashback to walking the shoreline with her father who as a soldier in the Army, has died. Jane's injuries worsen and Michelle struggles to climb to her and help her. Later, she also feels she might lose it from the chaos and picks up the call phone only to find it dead. Dorothy leans out of the plane and appears to have a state of shock before George notices and pulls her back in the plane. Michelle then begins to instruct the passengers on a possible crash landing or water landing and passes out life jackets. Gail becomes hysterical when she cannot get a life jacket for David, but soon is calmed by Michelle. Roy panics when he sees hydraulic fluid leaking from the wings. The tower alerts Kahului Fire and Rescue personnel and they arrive before the crippled jet lands. Finally after several tense minutes, Mimi and Bob are able to figure out a plan for the emergency. After some time, the plane lands but with difficulties in the brakes to the vessel and hydraulics. The pilots were worried that the landing might result in a broken plane and fire, but miraculously their landing resulted in no deaths and the emergency notification allowed crews to treat and evacuate passengers immediately. "
wikipedia-2278242," Missouri Tigers  The Missouri Tigers athletics programs include the extramural and intramural sports teams of the University of Missouri, located in Columbia, Missouri, United States. The name comes from a band of armed guards called the Missouri Tigers who, in 1864, protected Columbia from Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War. The University of Missouri (often referred to as Mizzou or MU) is the flagship institution of the University of Missouri System. The women's teams are sometimes called the Lady Tigers, but often both the men's and women's teams are simply called the Tigers. Mizzou is a member of the Southeastern Conference, and is the only NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision program in Missouri. Its wrestling program, the only one sponsored by an SEC member school, competes in the Mid-American Conference. Prior to joining the SEC in 2012, Missouri was a charter member of what is now the Big 12 Conference, competing in that conference from starting in 1907 when it was known as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which officially changed its name to the Big Eight Conference in 1964, then to the Big 12 in 1996 after adding half of the remaining schools in the former Southwest Conference (one of these schools, Texas A&M, joined the SEC with Missouri in 2012). Varsity sports. The Missouri Tigers are represented in the following NCAA Division I varsity sports: Baseball. The first Missouri Tigers baseball team was in 1868. The first recorded season was in 1891, when the Tigers went 2–2.The Tigers won the National Championship in 1954. The presence of former Missouri Tiger baseball players in professional baseball continues to grow each year. Current MU head coach Tim Jamieson has seen 40 players in his 13-year tenure sign pro contracts. Notable Tiger baseball alumni include Tim Laudner, who played for the 1987 World Champion Minnesota Twins, and Phil Bradley, who played for several teams in 1980s and early 1990s. In 2006, pitcher Max Scherzer became the highest draft pick in Mizzou history when the Arizona Diamondbacks selected him in the first round with the 11th overall pick. Two years later, pitcher Aaron Crow broke that record by being picked 9th overall by the Washington Nationals. Current Major Leaguer Ian Kinsler is a former Tiger who also played for Coach Jamieson. Basketball. Men's basketball. The men's basketball program has produced several NBA players, including Anthony Peeler, Doug Smith, Jon Sundvold, Steve Stipanovich, Kareem Rush, Keyon Dooling, Linas Kleiza, Thomas Gardner, and DeMarre Carroll. The Tigers were regularly a national power under Norm Stewart, whose tenure spanned four decades but which failed to include a Final Four appearance despite numerous conference championships. The team advanced to the Elite Eight under Quin Snyder in 2002, but inconsistent performance and various improprieties in his leadership of the program caused him to be fired in the midst of an abysmal 2006 season. He was replaced with then-UAB head coach Mike Anderson. In 2009 the team lost in the Elite Eight to the Connecticut Huskies. Then, after a first-round exit from the NCAA tournament in 2011, Anderson took the head coaching position with the University of Arkansas. The head coaching vacancy was filled in early April 2011 with Frank Haith, the former Miami (Florida) head coach. Women's basketball. The current head coach of the women's basketball program is Robin Pingeton, formerly of Illinois State. She was hired in April 2010 to replace Cindy Stein, who resigned under pressure from boosters and media after the 2009–10 season. Football. The university's first football team was formed in 1890 by the sophomore class of the ""Academic School"" (now the College of Arts and Science). They challenged a team of Engineering students in April of that year upon encouragement of Dr. A. L. McRea, a university professor. Interest in the sport quickly grew among the students, professors, and administrators, and a Foot Ball Association was formed at a meeting on October 10, 1890. The first intercollegiate game for the university took place on Thanksgiving Day, 1890, when Missouri played Washington University before a crowd of 3,000 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Washington University team, which had already been playing for several years, easily defeated the University of Missouri team by a score of 28–0. Missouri has compiled a 13–16 record in bowl games, and has finished in the final Associated Press poll Top Ten seven times since the poll began in 1936. Softball. Missouri softball began play in 1975. Missouri has made the Women's College World Series six times, including three times in the last four seasons. Notable non varsity sports. Rugby. The University of Missouri Men's Rugby Club plays Division 1 college rugby in the Heart of America conference against traditional rivals such as Kansas and Kansas State. Mizzou has been led since 2010 by head coach J.P. Victor. Missouri rugby finished the 2011-2012 season ranked 17th. As the winner of the Heart of America conference, Missouri qualified for the playoffs of the 2012 men's collegiate DI-AA championships, reaching the round of 16 before losing to Wisconsin. Mizzou defeated Kansas 24-7 to finish third at the 2012 Heart of America 7s tournament. Rivalries. MU vs. KU. Historically, the Tigers' biggest rival was the Kansas Jayhawks, with whom they competed in the annual Border War. This was one of the most intense rivalries in college sports, going back to a time of actual armed conflict between pro- and anti-slavery residents in Missouri and the Kansas Territory known as Bleeding Kansas. The series ended for the foreseeable future once Mizzou moved to the SEC. The Kansas–Missouri football series is the second-oldest and second-most-played rivalry in college football history. (See: The Rivalry (Lehigh–Lafayette)) The teams first matched up in football on October 31, 1891. Missouri claims to lead the all-time series, 57–54–9, since it counts the forfeit of Kansas' 1960 victory as a win. Missouri claims the 1911 football game in Columbia, Missouri as the world's first Homecoming. An important meeting between the Tigers and Jayhawks occurred on November 24, 2007 when the two teams played for the Big 12 North Championship and a shot at playing for the Big 12 Championship and a possible National Championship. The Tigers defeated the Jayhawks 36–28. This is regarded as the biggest victory in Missouri's history, which also occurred in the best season in Missouri's history. The Tigers best season ever later resulted in a trip to the Cotton Bowl Classic, where they defeated Arkansas 38–7. MU vs. Nebraska. The Missouri-Nebraska football series was another historic rivalry alongside the MU–KU series, although it ended with Nebraska's departure for the Big Ten Conference. The Missouri–Nebraska series was the second oldest rivalry in the Big 12, dating back to 1892. The two teams met 104 times, with Nebraska leading the series 65–36–3. The large lead was the result of a 24-year Nebraska winning streak from 1979 to 2002. The teams split the eight games played from 2003 to 2010. The rivalry saw renewed interest following the Flea Kicker. The two teams played for the Victory Bell trophy, which was first awarded in 1927. MU vs. Illinois. There is also a relatively new basketball rivalry with the Illinois Fighting Illini of the Big Ten Conference referred to as Braggin' Rights. The Braggin' Rights game debuted in 1980 and has been played every year since 1983. Missouri trails the series 20–11. The start of football season also often matches the two schools in the ""Arch Rivalry"" game, most recently played at the Edward Jones Dome. Mizzou leads the football series with an all-time record of 14–7 since 1896. In addition, the Missouri and Illinois baseball teams have recently begun a baseball rivalry, meeting at Busch Stadium since 2005 (though the schools did not meet in 2009 or 2011). Missouri leads the series 5-1 since 2005. MU vs. Oklahoma. The Tiger–Sooner Peace Pipe is a rivalry trophy presented to the winner of the Missouri vs. Oklahoma game. The trophy is a ceremony of smoking the old pipe. The trophy was inaugurated in 1929 by Chester M. Brewer, Mizzou's director of athletics, and by members of Mystical Seven, a University of Missouri honorary group ... The peace pipe was donated by a Mr. R. L. Hill, an ""M"" man and former president of the Missouri student body ... Ceremony takes place during halves, with Mystical Seven representing Missouri, and a similar organization representing Oklahoma ... Missouri won the first game, 13–0. During Mizzou's tenure in the Big 12, the conference's divisional play structure meant that the Tigers and the Sooners only faced off two out every four years. Therefore, only scheduled games between the two teams count for the exchange of the Peace Pipe. The most recent Big 12 Championship games featuring Mizzou and Oklahoma would not have triggered a transfer of the Peace Pipe (if Missouri had won on either occasion.) Oklahoma leads the all-time series with a record of 65–23–5. In 2010, Mizzou, ranked no. 11 in the BCS standings, defeated no. 1 ranked Oklahoma, 36–27. Oklahoma leads the series since the trophy tradition started with a record of 56–14–4. MU vs. Iowa State. The Telephone Trophy started during a 1959 Game featuring Iowa State and Missouri When the field phones were tested prior to the game, it was found that both teams could hear each other. The problem was solved by game time, but not without considerable worry on the part of the coaches. The Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of Ames had a trophy made and presented it to Iowa State to be awarded each year to the team winning the game. An odd sidelight to the whole affair was that the same thing happened to Missouri later in the year in a game played at Columbia. Missouri won the first game, 14–0. The series is 58–34–9 in favor of Missouri. Missouri leads the series since the trophy tradition started with a record of 30–18–3. Traditions. Homecoming. The University of Missouri claims to be the originator of the tradition of homecoming. Before games against the University of Kansas were played in Kansas City. However, a change in conference regulations required intercollegiate football games to be played on campus starting in 1911. Fearing that game attendance would be low, the new Missouri coach, C. L. Brewer, appealed with great success for the ""Old Grads"" to ""Come Back Home"" to boost attendance and help dedicate MU's new football field. The fans responded, swelling the crowd at Rollins Field in Columbia to more than ten thousand. MU, Trivial Pursuit, and Jeopardy! all verify that this game in 1911 was one of the first homecoming games. The 2010 edition of the University of Missouri Homecoming also included the first ever visit by ESPN College GameDay. 18,000 fans attended College GameDay at the Francis Quadrangle on Saturday, October 23, 2010. The turnout broke the previous record of 15,800 fans set at the University of Nebraska in 2001. Big MO. Big MO is a 6-foot, 150-pound bass drum featured at Mizzou football games. Big MO's handlers are actually University of Missouri alumni rather than student members of Marching Mizzou. Big MO is used to lead fans in the traditional MIZ-ZOU cheer. The drum has been a Mizzou football tradition since 1981, when it was acquired by a Mizzou athletic booster club known as the St. Louis Quarterback Club. The club donated $5,000 to purchase the drum, which was built by Ludwig Drums in Chicago. The drum, originally painted red with gold flakes, was brought back from Chicago strapped in the back of a pickup truck. When it arrived in Columbia, the drum was repainted black and presented to the university a week before the first 1981 football game at an event known as the Tiger Fall Rally. Responsibility for Big MO was transferred to the Mizzou chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma in 1993. Only student and alumni members of the two organizations are eligible to be on the Big MO crew. Big MO is the third largest bass drum in the United States, behind Big Bertha at the University of Texas and the Purdue Big Bass Drum. In April 2011, the Mizzou chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma kicked off a fundraising campaign to replace Big MO, which has deteriorated over several decades of use. The new Big MO will weigh 800-plus-pounds and have a 9-foot diameter and a 54-inch width, making it the largest collegiate bass drum as well as largest bass drum in the United States. The new drum was built by Neil Boumpani of Boumpani Music Company, a custom drum maker in Barnesville, Georgia. The new record-setting Big MO will debut as Mizzou enters play in the Southeastern Conference in 2012. Harpo's goal post tradition. Since 1971, there has been no doubt about the destination of the goal posts anytime they have been torn down following a home football game. 1971 marked the first year in which the goal posts ended up at Harpo's Bar and Grill at 29 S. Tenth Street in Columbia. Although no concrete reasoning is known behind the tradition, it is suggested that Harpo's became the destination because of its popularity among alumni returning to Columbia on game days and because the restaurant is one of the few places that had remained under consistent ownership without any name changes, so alumni and students all easily identify with the establishment. Following the 2005 season, removable goal posts were installed, which are lowered at the close of each home game. In 2010 the goal post tradition was revived following the victory against BCS #1 ranked Oklahoma. Thousands of fans began to swarm the field before the final play had even ended. Although there were event staff and highway patrol encircling the field, security was unable to prevent fans from storming the field and removing the north end zone goal post from the stadium. Alma mater. The Alma Mater for the University of Missouri is ""Old Missouri"". It was written in 1895 and is sung to the tune of Annie Lisle and has two verses. Before and after athletic events, sometimes only the first verse is used. The first and second and second verses are more commonly sung at student orientation and at commencement/graduation ceremonies. Both verses are followed by the chorus. First Verse Old Missouri, fair Missouri Dear old varsity. Ours are hearts that fondly love thee Here's a health to thee. Chorus Proud art thou in classic beauty Of thy noble past With thy watch words honour, duty, Thy high fame shall last! Second verse Every student, man and maiden Swells the glad refrain. 'Till the breezes, music laden Waft it back again. Chorus Proud art thou in classic beauty Of thy noble past With thy watch words honour, duty, Thy high fame shall last! Tiger media. The Tiger Radio Network is anchored by KMBZ in Kansas City, KTGR AM/KCMQ FM in Columbia and Jefferson City, and KTRS in St Louis. Mike Kelly is the commentator for both sports, with Howard Richards and Chris Gervino serving as analysts for football and Gary Link filling in for basketball. In addition, the school owns and operates its own NBC affiliate, KOMU-TV, in Columbia. The station is run by MU faculty members and is staffed by professionals and students. It's the only college-owned and operated network affiliate in the country. For indoor sports, Mizzou operates the Missouri Sports Network, a syndication package that airs on FSN Midwest and/or Metro Sports. It mainly broadcasts volleyball and basketball. Dan McLaughlin handles play-by-play for all sports, and is joined by a rotating group of color commentators, most notably Tigers coaching legend Norm Stewart for men's basketball games. "
wikipedia-2278273," The Nylons  The Nylons are an a cappella group founded in 1978 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, best known for their covers of pop songs such as The Turtles' ""Happy Together"", Steam's ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"", and The Tokens' version of the traditional ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"". The band's current lineup includes Claude Morrison (tenor), Garth Mosbaugh (tenor), Gavin Hope (baritone) and Tyrone Gabriel (bass). Morrison is the only original member still with the band today.

wikipedia-2278333," His Band and the Street Choir  His Band and the Street Choir (also referred to as ""Street Choir"") is the fourth solo album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released on 15 November 1970 by Warner Bros. Records. Originally titled ""Virgo's Fool"", ""Street Choir"" was renamed by Warner Bros. without Morrison's consent. Recording began in early 1970 with a demo session in a small church in Woodstock, New York. Morrison booked the A&R Studios on 46th Street in New York City in the second quarter of 1970 to produce two sessions of songs that were released on ""His Band and the Street Choir"". Reviewers praised the music of both sessions for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics were considered to be simple compared with those of his previous work. Morrison had intended to record the album ""a cappella"" with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band. Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard ""Street Choir"" poorly in later years. ""His Band and the Street Choir"" was as well received as Morrison's previous album, ""Moondance"". ""Street Choir"" peaked at number 32 on the ""Billboard"" 200 and number 18 on the UK Album Chart. It owes its success mainly to the US Top Ten single ""Domino"", which was released before the album and surpassed Morrison's 1967 hit, ""Brown Eyed Girl"". As of 2010, ""Domino"" remains the most successful single of Morrison's solo career. Two other singles were released from the album, ""Blue Money"" and ""Call Me Up in Dreamland""; although less successful, they still managed to reach the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. Production. Recording. Recording began with a demo session at a small church in Woodstock, which was not intended to produce any official releases. During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (""Astral Weeks"" and ""Moondance""), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before (""Crazy Face"" and ""Give Me a Kiss""), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: ""I found an old church and we would just load in. I'd set up a pair of mikes and we would just run down some tracks with the tapes running. They became like a working thing for the album."" For his new band Morrison brought back three musicians from the ""Moondance"" sessions: saxophonist Jack Schroer; guitarist John Platania and bassist John Klingberg. The backing vocal trio of Emily Houston, Judy Clay and Jackie Verdell also returned to sing on ""If I Ever Needed Someone"". Multi-instrumentalist Dahaud Shaar joined for ""His Band and the Street Choir""; he was a veteran of the ""Moondance"" tour, though he had not played on the album. Keyboardist Alan Hand joined Morrison's band in late April 1970, replacing Jef Labes, who had left the band and moved to Israel before the end of the year. Keith Johnson completed the line-up on trumpet and Hammond organ. Between March and May 1970 Morrison began work on the album at the A&R recording studios in New York City. He intended to create a full ""a capella"" record, and with this in mind assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir, consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar, Larry Goldsmith, Andrew Robinson and then wife, Janet ""Planet"" Rigsbee, who all lived near Woodstock. He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists, but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join: the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer (Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer). However, Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of ""a cappella"": ""I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir ... I asked them if they wanted to sing ... then the old ladies got involved and it ruined the whole thing."" He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir, as he wanted to use the group for a different effect: ""I wanted these certain guys to form an ""a cappella"" group so that I could cut a lot of songs with just maybe one guitar. But it didn't turn out."" During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock, as well as ""Gypsy Queen"" and an additional instrumental, six of which were used on ""Street Choir"". Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session, after he helped to produce ""Moondance"". However, according to biographer Clinton Heylin, Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement, so he was not used for the rest of the album. Morrison returned to the A&R studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: ""Elliot thought he was going to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role."" Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song ""Street Choir"" shortly before studio work concluded. Composition. Some songs featured on ""His Band and the Street Choir"" were first recorded for the albums ""Astral Weeks"" and ""Moondance"". Morrison rewrote and rearranged them for release on ""Street Choir"" because the recordings for his new album featured different personnel and instrumentation. The songs on the album, which ""Rolling Stone"" reviewer Jon Landau believes have a free, relaxed sound to them, borrow from various music genres; the simple lyrics lack the complexity popularly expected from Morrison's work. The first recording that would feature on ""His Band and the Street Choir"" was ""I've Been Working"", an out-take from the ""Astral Weeks"" sessions in 1968 and the ""Moondance"" sessions in 1969. The final version produced on ""His Band and the Street Choir"" is upbeat and shows the influence of James Brown. Morrison notably sings the line ""Woman, woman, woman, you make me feel alright"" in unison with the horn section, which Jon Landau describes as ""breathtaking"". ""Domino"" had been recorded many times before its release. The first was in sessions from September to November 1968, just after ""Astral Weeks"" was recorded. Morrison rearranged ""Domino"" frequently from 1968 to 1970, notably recording rap and harmony versions. For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4/4 tempo and features rhythm guitar. Horn overdubs were later added to the recording. Morrison ad libs between the end of the chorus and the start of the verses, when he shouts the words ""Dig it!"", as well as near the end with ""And the band ... one more time!"", which, according to biographer Peter Mills, helps bring out the theme of ""liveliness"" in both the song and the album as a whole. The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer-songwriter, Fats Domino. As with ""Domino"", Morrison first recorded ""If I Ever Needed Someone"" in late 1968; it is one of many blues-influenced tracks on the album. ""Virgo Clowns"" was first recorded at the start of 1969 as ""(Sit Down) Funny Face"". Morrison next recorded it during the first ""Street Choir"" session, renaming it simply ""Funny Face"". It was re-recorded during the second session under the completely different title of ""Virgo Clowns"". In its final form, Morrison and John Platania duet on acoustic guitars. As the song fades out laughter is heard performed by Dahaud Shaar and Larry Goldsmith . ""Crazy Face"" evolved from ""Going Around with Jesse James"", a song Morrison first recorded for ""Astral Weeks"" on 15 October 1968. Both songs contain references to American outlaw Jesse James. Morrison arranged ""Crazy Face"" in the irregular time signature 8/4; the first, third and seventh beats of the bar are emphasised. It begins with a gentle piano introduction, and ends abruptly, which, in Peter Mills' view, represents a shot from a gun, consistent with the American outlaw theme. ""Give Me a Kiss"" and ""Gypsy Queen"" are the final songs recorded during the first recording session. Morrison wrote ""Give me a Kiss"" about either Planet or his newly born baby girl Shana. It is a twelve bar blues in the style of boogie rock, a music genre prominent in the 1960s, leading reviewers to compare the song to the work of The Beatles and Elvis Presley. Reviewers believed the song ""Gypsy Queen"" was inspired by ""Gypsy Woman"", first recorded by Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions. Johnny Rogan feels the song is ""a failed attempt to recapture the spirit of 'Caravan'"", another Morrison composition inspired by ""Gypsy Woman"", released on the album ""Moondance"". Morrison sings the song in falsetto, while keyboardist Alan Hand plays celeste, imitating a music box at both the beginning and end. The second recording session yielded the remaining material. ""Call Me Up in Dreamland"" is a gospel-style composition. The lyrics refer to life on the road, as Morrison was touring when he recorded the album. They also refer to Morrison and Janet Planet's life at the time: ""We were finally, really living in a dreamland—believe it or not—it was a magical time"", Planet recalled. ""I'll Be Your Lover, Too"" was inspired by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. ""Blue Money"", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) ""Sweet Jannie"" is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet. The lyrics, ""I've been in love with you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school"" lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan. In the album closer, ""Street Choir"", Morrison repeats the questions, ""Why did you let me down / And now that things are better off / Why do you come around"". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that ""such songs ""Street Choir"" were spawned by an increasing awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been"". Ken Brooks has said that the lyric ""Move On Up"" is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that ""Street Choir"" was one of the ""two or three finest songs"" of Morrison's career because of its ""musical and poetic energy"". Packaging. Warner Bros. Records scheduled ""His Band and the Street Choir"" for rush-release to sell over Christmas 1970, leaving little time to plan the packaging. These pressured conditions led the company to mistitle the promotional releases as ""His Band and Street Choir"" and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing. At the end of ""I'll Be Your Lover, Too"" an unedited conversation is left on the finished record, which Peter Mills notes is an example of the album's rough edges. Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes, which sound ""a little desperate"", in the words of Brian Hinton, as she wrote, ""This is the album that you ""must"" sing with, dance to, you ""must"" find a place for these songs somewhere in your life."" David Gahr took the gatefold photos of Morrison surrounded by his musicians with their wives and children at a party for Planet's son, Peter, born from a previous relationship. Morrison dismissed these photos as ""rubbish"". However, Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse; it included a ""hilarious"" image of Morrison in a full-length kaftan. Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well: ""people think you're a hippie because of the long hair and beard. ... I'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock, and that's what people were wearing."" Mills agrees that ""Van Morrison was never a hippie, but this was as close as he came."" Reception. Release. ""His Band and the Street Choir"" was first released on LP on 15 November 1970 and was Morrison's third record to be produced for Warner Bros. It was re-released by the record company on CD in 1987, 1990 and 2005, and LP in 2008 with Rhino Records. ""His Band and the Street Choir"" peaked at number 32 on the ""Billboard"" 200, and at number 18 on the UK Album Chart. The album received a warm reception in North America—as ""Moondance"" had done—largely due to the success of ""Domino"", a sampler single that peaked at number 9 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. This single remains Morrison's biggest US hit (as of 2010), as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit ""Brown Eyed Girl"", from the album ""Blowin' Your Mind!"". ""Domino"" was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40. Jon Landau of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine attributed the success of ""Domino"" to the guitar figure at the beginning of the track, which he considered ""not only a great way to start a single, but a fine way to begin the album"". ""Blue Money"" debuted as the second single, faltering outside the ""Top 20"" at number 23 in the US. The final single, ""Call Me Up in Dreamland"", managed only two weeks on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100, while reaching number 95; biographer Ken Brooks believed it deserved better. John Platania recalled that Morrison ""had designs"" on securing radio airplay for ""Street Choir"", and the success of its singles reflected a growing audience and commercial appeal for his music. Critical response. Reviewers generally praised ""Street Choir"". Jon Landau compared it to Morrison's previous work: ""ZigZag"" magazine reviewer John Tobler felt, ""even if it's inferior to ""Moondance"", it is still better than eighty per cent of the records you've got in your collection."" Robert Christgau was more critical, calling it ""a less compelling album than ""Moondance"""" containing ""a few humdrum cuts and an occasional minor lapse of taste"". He nonetheless awarded the album an ""A-minus"", later upgraded to an ""A"". Biographer Brian Hinton commented that ""His Band and the Street Choir"" is ""vaguely reminiscent of Bob Dylan's ""Nashville Skyline"""". Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello identified ""His Band and the Street Choir"" as one of his 500 essential albums and ""Street Choir"" as one of his favorite songs. In 2006 Johnny Rogan called the songs on the album ""a severe disappointment when compared to the material on the previous two albums."" Morrison and the musicians' responses. Van Morrison regarded ""Street Choir"" poorly, as he told biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: ""Somewhere along the line I lost control of that album. I'd rather not think about that album because it doesn't mean much in terms of where I was at ... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad."" Morrison first lost control of the album before its release, when it was retitled from ""Virgo's Fool"" to ""His Band and the Street Choir"": Despite this, assistant producer and drummer Dahaud Shaar recalled that Morrison had positive feelings towards the album at the time of its release. Janet Planet holds the view that ""There is much to love about the songs on this album: 'Blue Money', 'Crazy Face', 'Call Me Up in Dreamland', 'Domino' - these are just great songs in any era.""

wikipedia-2278341," Saint Dominic's Preview  ""Saint Dominic's Preview"" is the sixth solo album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released in July 1972 by Warner Bros. Records. ""Rolling Stone"" declared it ""the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released."" The diversity of the material on the album highlighted Morrison's fusing of Celtic folk, R&B, blues, jazz and the singer-songwriter genre. ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and the title track were blends of soul and folk, while lesser known tracks such as ""Gypsy"" and ""Redwood Tree"" continued to display a lyrical celebration of nature's beauty. Also on the album were two lengthy tracks, ""Listen to the Lion"" and the closing ""Almost Independence Day"" which were given primal, cathartic and intense vocal performances from Morrison. These tracks were similar to the songs on his 1968 album, ""Astral Weeks"". The album reached number 15 on the Billboard 200 when it was released. This would remain Morrison's best ever U.S. success on the Billboard 200 until 2008 when ""Keep It Simple"" came in at number 10 on the Billboard chart. Recording. The album was recorded during late winter and spring in 1971 at Wally Heider Studios and Pacific High Studios in San Francisco and at the Church in San Anselmo. The fourth track on the album, ""Listen to the Lion"" was recorded during the ""Tupelo Honey"" sessions in 1971 at Columbia Studios in San Francisco. Ted Templeman was co-producer on the album. Several of the musicians who played on the album were newly recruited: Jules Broussard, saxophonist and previously from Boz Scaggs, pianist Mark Naftalin who had previously played with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, guitarist Ron Elliott from The Beau Brummels and Bernie Krause played the Moog synthesizer. Composition and themes. Unlike his two previous albums, Morrison spoke well of this one when interviewed by biographer Ritchie Yorke: ""The album was kind of rushed because of studio time and things like that. But I thought it was a good shot, that album. There were a lot of good songs on it. ""St. Dominic's Preview"" was more into where I'm at, more into what I was doing."" The album contained only seven songs because of the length of two of the songs. The album opens with ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" pop and R&B in genre and a tribute to Jackie Wilson, one of Morrison's influences who had a hit with the song ""Reet Petite"". According to ""Rolling Stone"" reviewer Stephen Holden on ""Gypsy"": ""Van states where he's at artistically; the rhythms, alternating between double and triple time, are driving and excited, the harmonies faintly Middle Eastern, and the multiple guitar textures exotic."" ""I Will Be There"" is a twelve-bar blues played with a honky-tonk piano and evoking Ray Charles composed of heavily realistic lyrics that speak of the singer grabbing an overcoat, his toothbrush and underwear. ""Listen to the Lion"" is an eleven-minute song that begins with a mellow opening and Morrison then improvises new singing methods, turning himself into a lion with growling, wailing and various other vocal techniques as the song progresses. It has been said to be, by both technique and emotion, ""a vocal performance that remains unparalleled by his contemporaries."" Caledonia, one of Morrison's favourite symbols, is referred to ""during the coda when he works himself up into a trancelike gospel improvisation"": ""And we sailed and we sailed and we sailed and we sailed... way up to Caledonia."" Brian Hinton described the song: ""We are back in ""Astral Weeks"" territory, a bass led shuffle and Van lost in his own poetic universe, but here his voice takes wilder risks; growling, a near death rattle, feral grunts and roars."" The chorus chanting ""Listen to the Lion"" behind the singer is made up of three male voices, including Morrison, ""singing at himself"". The title track, ""Saint Dominic's Preview"", was said by Morrison to have been composed after seeing an ad for a peace vigil to be held at St. Dominic's Church in San Francisco. The song is written in a ""stream of consciousness"" fashion as with the ""Astral Weeks"" songs. Lyrics in the song refer to different stages of Morrison's life: ""chamois cleaning all the windows"" (teenage years) and ""The record company has paid out for the wine"" (his contemporary status as a pop music star). Erik Hage calls it ""expansive and groundbreaking, representing an enlarging scope and ambition in Morrison's music."" ""Redwood Tree"" is reminiscent of ""And It Stoned Me"" on the ""Moondance"" album, with a soulful celebration of nature, water and a boy's childhood experiences. ""Almost Independence Day"" is a two-chord cycle that uses a moog synthesizer and various musical and vocal techniques to translate to the listener the feelings the singer had while staring across the San Francisco harbor. Along with ""Listen to the Lion"", it is more than ten minutes in length and has been compared to it as being as ""musically daring in its own way"". Erik Hage describes the song as ""a mood piece, and a precursor to his 1980s work (particularly ""Common One""), where his whole raison d'être became trying to inspire meditative states in the listener."" Speaking of this song, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke: ""It wasn't my concept to write a sequel to 'Madame George'. I like the song though. It was just contemplating organ and the Moog. Everything was recorded live except that one high part on the synthesiser. I asked Bernie Krause to do this thing of China Town and then come in with the high part because I was thinking of dragons and fireworks. It reminded me of that. It was a stream of consciousness trip again."" Reception. The album charted at number 15 on the Billboard 200. This would remain Morrison's best ever U.S. charting until 2008's ""Keep It Simple"" came in at number 10 on the Billboard charts. Erik Hage wrote that ""it is one of the strongest albums in the Van Morrison canon because it seems to adapt and incorporate all of the lessons and discoveries of the rich period of evolution that came before it while still opening up new windows."" Miles Palmer writing in ""The Times"" commented that ""The cumulative impact is devastating."" In ""Rolling Stone"", Stephen Holden wrote that ""The coexistence of two styles on the same record turns out to be very refreshing; they complement each other by underscoring the remarkable versatility of Van's musical imagination."" He also declared it ""the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released"". Robert Christgau ends his A- rated review with: ""The point being that words—which on this album are as uneven as the tunes—sometimes say less than voices. Amen."" The Allmusic review with a rating of 4.5 stars comments that the album, ""hangs together on the strength of its songs, an intriguingly diverse collection which draws together the disparate threads of the singer's recent work into one sterling package."" Packaging. The album was originally planned to be titled ""Green"" but it was changed after Morrison wrote the song, ""Saint Dominic's Preview"" and used it as the title song. ""A Rolling Stone"" profile of Morrison in June 1972 quoted him as saying that the song had evolved from a dream about a St. Dominic's church gathering where a mass for peace in Northern Ireland was being held. ""Rolling Stone"" then commented that later while Morrison was in Nevada he read in a newspaper article that a mass was being held the next day for peace at a St. Dominic's church in San Francisco. It was his first album not to have love as its central theme and significantly (as his marriage was deteriorating) the cover shows Morrison sitting on church steps playing guitar with ripped trousers and scruffy boots looking like a gypsy troubadour out on the street. Photographs for the album were taken by Michael Maggid in St. Anselm's Church in San Anselmo, California near Morrison's home with the cover photograph shot on the steps of Montgomery Chapel on the grounds of the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo.

Recorded during a series of prolific recording sessions, there was more than enough material to fill a double-album. Morrison proposed the idea to Warner Bros. Records, but he was ultimately convinced to release a single LP. During the recording sessions held between August and November 1972, there were nearly thirty songs recorded in all, at least three quarters of them original compositions. A few leftover tracks were saved or re-recorded for future albums like ""Veedon Fleece"", but most would not see release until 1998's compilation of outtakes, ""The Philosopher's Stone"", when nine of the songs would be used. Biographer Clinton Heylin suggested that ""only 'Warm Love' and 'Hard Nose the Highway' could have sat comfortably alongside 'rejects' like 'Madame Joy', 'Bulbs', 'Spare Me a Little', 'Country Fair', 'Contemplation Rose' and 'Drumshanbo Hustle'."" By Morrison's own account, this was the first album that was completely produced under his complete control. The recording sessions even took place in a recording studio he had built next door to his home in Fairfax, California. He remarked on the album: ""As a concept for the album, I was just trying to establish how hard it was to do what I do. Plus there were some lighter things on the other side of it. One side has a kind of hard feeling while the other is soft."" Composition. ""Snow in San Anselmo"" is the opening song and features the backing vocals of the Oakland Symphony Chamber Chorus. Morrison says the song is, ""just a sketch on when it snowed in San Anselmo. It's about the images that were happening when it was snowing there for the first time in thirty years."" ""Warm Love"" was released as a successful single and was also a favorite concert performance in the 70s. It featured the catchy line, ""and it's ever present everywhere, Warm Love."" The title song, ""Hard Nose the Highway"" is explained by Morrison as: ""the theme running through the whole song is 'Seen some hard times' which I have 'Drawn some fine lines' which I definitely have, and 'No time for shoe shines' when you're trying to make a living."" ""Wild Children"" is actually about the post-war children growing up in other countries and getting their images—from American anti-heroes such as those portrayed by James Dean, Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger and playwright Tennessee Williams. ""The Great Deception"" is according to biographer, Richie Yorke: ""One of the most stinging indictments from any observer, let alone a rock artist, of the tragic hypocrisy of so many participants in the sub-culture, in particular the big-time rock stars of this era."" ""Being Green"" is the first non-original composition Morrison had included on any album for Warner Bros. so far and was taken from the popular American children's TV show, Sesame Street, which he must have watched with his young daughter, Shana. He says about his interpretation of the song, ""That was just a statement that you don't have to be flamboyant. If somebody doesn't like you just because you're a certain thing, then maybe they're seeing the wrong thing."" A reviewer said about the ten and a half minute ""Autumn Song"": ""I can't deny that it's the funkiest song about the splendors and moods of fall that has ever glided through my ears.""  The ending song, ""Purple Heather"" is the traditional ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" written by F. McPeake as a variant of Robert Tannahill's ""The Braes of Balquhidder"", and re-arranged by Morrison. Reception. According to Ritchie Yorke, who published his biography, ""Into the Music"" in 1975, the album enjoyed rave reviews at the time of release. He cited one dissenting critic Charlie Gillett, who wrote in ""Let It Rock"": ""The trouble with ""Hard Nose the Highway"" is that although the music is quite often interesting, it doesn't have a convincing emotional basis...Despite the lack of inspiration and of melodic focus, the record is attractive to listen to. But Van Morrison has set high standards for himself and ""Hard Nose the Highway"" doesn't live up to them."" Robert Christgau rated it only a B− and mostly dismissed it with: ""The relaxed rhythms are just lax most of the time, the vocal surprises mild after St. Dominic's Preview, the lyrics dumbest when they're more than mood pieces, and the song construction offhand except on 'Warm Love'."" Stephen Holden in his 1973 ""Rolling Stone"" review said: """"Hard Nose the Highway"" is psychologically complex, musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellent. Its surface pleasures are a little less than those of ""St. Dominic's Preview"" and a great deal less than those of ""Tupelo Honey"", while its lyric depths are richer and more accessible than those of either predecessor. The major theme of Hard Nose is nostalgia, briefly but firmly counter-pointed by disillusion."" Later assessments in ""The Rolling Stone Record Guide"" (1979) and ""The Rolling Stone Album Guide"" (1992) were less generous. In the former, ""Hard Nose"" was listed as Morrison's only one-star album to date; reviewer Dave Marsh called it ""a failed sidestep, a compromise between the visionary demands of Morrison's work and his desire for a broad-based audience."" In the later edition, Paul Evans called the record the ""vaguest and weakest"" of Morrison's 1970s output. In the opinion of biographer Erik Hage, """"Hard Nose the Highway"" seems to have suffered a lot of unnecessary criticism—many commentators consider it his worst and most uninspired album—perhaps because it followed such a remarkable run of LPs, and because two truly forward-thinking albums had come before and after it (1972's ""Saint Dominic's Preview"" and 1974's ""Veedon Fleece"").""

wikipedia-2278358," It's Too Late to Stop Now  ""It's Too Late to Stop Now"" is a live album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1974 (see 1974 in music). Frequently named as one of the best live albums ever recorded, ""It's Too Late to Stop Now"" was recorded during what has often been said to be Morrison's greatest phase as a live performer. The double album was composed of performances that were recorded in concerts at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, California, the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and at The Rainbow in London from a three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra from May to July 1973. The tour and performances. Noted for being a mercurial and temperamental live performer, during this short period of time in 1973, Morrison went on one of his most diligent tours in years. With his eleven piece band, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, which included a horn and string section, he has often been said to have been at his live performing peak. Morrison said about touring during this time period: I am getting more into performing. It's incredible. When I played Carnegie Hall in the fall something just happened. All of a sudden I felt like 'you're back into performing' and it just happened like that...A lot of times in the past I've done gigs and it was rough to get through them. But now the combination seems to be right and it's been clicking a lot. Evidence of his newly invigorated joy in performing was on display during the ending of the over-ten-minute long dynamic performance of ""Cyprus Avenue"". When an audience member shouts out, ""Turn it on!"", Morrison good-naturedly replies, ""It's turned on already."" At the very end he finished the concert with a final heartfelt, ""It's too late to stop now!"" giving the album its title (this line first appeared on the song ""Into the Mystic""). The concert performances were described by Erik Hage as ""sequences of a young soul lion whipping the crowd into a frenzy and then stopping on a dime—teasing out anticipation, rushing, receding, and coaxing every drop out of his band."" Guitarist John Platania says ""He had a funeral for a lot of his old songs on stage. With Caledonia, he really got off on performing. There was definitely joy getting onstage at that point. That was a wonderful time for everybody. It was really like a family. Ordinarily, with rock 'n' rollers, jazzers and classical musicians in the band, you'd think it was a three-headed serpent but everybody got along famously."" The performances on the live album were from tapes made at the beginning of the tour in Los Angeles and also in Santa Monica and London. Marco Bario who attended the opening night concert at The Troubadour said in ""Playgirl"": ""he was exceptional. The mood was right, the audience was receptive, and the music left no comparisons to be made. It was the finest opening night performance by a consummate musician that I have ever witnessed."" The London concerts were the first time he had appeared in that city since performing with Them, six years earlier. The two concerts at the Rainbow Theatre in London were referred to as ""the rock event of the year"" by critics according to Ritchie Yorke in his biography. The July 24, 1973 London Rainbow concert was the first BBC simulcast broadcast simultaneously on BBC 2 television and Radio 2 stereo so that viewers with strategically sited loudspeakers could enjoy ""stereo TV"". The broadcast took place on May 27, 1974. The songs. A mixture of songs that inspired his own musical development, together with some of his own compositions, allied to a backing band and orchestra (The Caledonia Soul Orchestra) and several performances (as noted in the album's liner notes) that were recorded in concerts at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, California (May 24–27, 1973), the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium (June 29, 1973) and at The Rainbow (July 23–24, 1973) in London. These performance result in what Myles Palmer of the ""Times"" reviewed as demolishing ""all barriers between the soul, blues, jazz and rock genres"". The songs chosen went back to his days with Them with versions of ""Gloria"" and ""Here Comes the Night"". His first solo hit ""Brown Eyed Girl"" was performed but wasn't included on the album until the reissue in 2008. M. Mark called the album ""an intelligent selection of songs that draws on six of Morrison's records and five of the musicians he learned from."" These musicians were Bobby Bland, (""Ain't Nothing You Can Do""), Ray Charles, ("" I Believe to My Soul""), Sam Cooke (""Bring It On Home to Me""), two songs by Sonny Boy Williamson II (""Help Me"" and ""Take Your Hands Out of My Pocket"") and a cover of a Willie Dixon song, ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" that was popularized by Muddy Waters. Unlike most live rock albums, there was no studio overdubbing allowed by Morrison, which resulted in the exclusion of ""Moondance"" from the album due to one wrong guitar note. Morrison strictly adhered to his concept of authenticity in presenting the live performance but his musical perfectionism prevented him from including ""Moondance"". ""It's common practice to go back and fix things, but not with Van,"" bass player David Hayes said, ""I think that's what makes it one of the best ever."" It is thought to be one of the first live albums with no overdubs and the first live album to have string players. Reception. Biographer John Collis calls this album, ""one of the most impressive of all attempts to squeeze the stage excitement of a rock performer on to vinyl."" Jason Ankenny with Allmusic ended his review by concluding that it was ""An engaging, warm portrait of the man at the peak of his powers"". Chris Jones of the BBC wrote: ""In a live setting all the hyperbole about Morrison's blend of genres into one Celtic, mystic vision makes perfect sense. This is soul music in a very real sense."" Robert Christgau gave the album an A rating and noted that ""Morrison documents his debt to blues and r&b definitively--you can hear Bobby Bland all over the record, and cover tributes are paid as well to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, and Sam Cooke."" Ken Emerson with ""Rolling Stone"" remarked: ""On ""It's Too Late"" Morrison's voice is in fine form, but much else is not...The other musicians, most of whom have played with Morrison many times before, never detract, but Morrison could be better served...But the power of Morrison's vocals overcomes these drawbacks."" Hal Horowitz with ""American Songwriter"" on reviewing the 2008 remasters of some of Morrison's albums, rated this album with five stars and commented: ""The classic is 1974’s double live ""It’s Too Late""…, rightfully on anyone’s shortlist of finest concert albums. Van typically blows hot and cold on stage, but when he ignites on the oldies and choice blues covers here, few can touch him for pure blue-eyed soul passion."" Aftermath. Three months after the concerts for the ""Too Late to Stop Now"" tour, Morrison had disbanded the The Caledonia Soul Orchestra and went on a vacation tour of Ireland for three weeks that resulted in the album, ""Veedon Fleece"". A remastered version of the album was released on 29 January 2008 containing a live take of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" not included on the original release. Legacy. ""It's Too Late to Stop Now"" has been on lists of greatest live albums of all time. Biographer Johnny Rogan states that ""Morrison was in the midst of what was arguably his greatest phase as a performer."" Track listing. All songs written by Van Morrison unless noted. Charts. Album.

wikipedia-2278442," Ahilyabai Holkar  Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar (31 May 1725 – 13 August 1795), was the Holkar Queen of the Maratha ruled Malwa kingdom, India. Rajmata Ahilyabai was born in the village of Chondi(चोंडी) in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar south of Indore on the Narmada River. Ahilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of Kumbher in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, died. A year after that she was coronated as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from Thugs, the plunderers. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army. She was a great pillar of the Maratha Power. Rani Ahilyabai was a great builder and patron of many Hindu temples which embellished Maheshwar and Indore. She also built temples and Dharmshala (free lodging) at sacred sites outside her kingdom, at prominent religious places like Dwarka in Gujarat east to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple at Varanasi on the Ganges, Ujjain, Nasik, Vishnupad Mandir, Gaya and Parali Baijnath in Maharashtra. Seeing the destroyed and desecrated temple in Somanath, Rani Ahilyabai built a temple where Lord Shiva is still worshipped by Hindus. Early life. Ahilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Shinde(Dhangar), was the patil of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write. Her entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander in the service of the Peshwa Bajirao and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723–1754). She was married to Khanderao in 1733.'"" She was very brave. Reign. Ahilya Bai’s husband Khanderao was killed during the siege of Kumbher in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, Malharrao died. Malharrao was succeeded by Malerao, the only son of Khanderao, but he also died on 5 April 1767. From 1767 until her death in 1795, she ruled Malwa, trained in both administrative and military matters by Malhar Rao. A letter to her from Malhar Rao in 1765 illustrates the trust he had in her ability during the tempestuous battle for power in the 18th century: Already trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar’s death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar was enthusiastic about her leadership. She had led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar Tukojirao Holkar (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai never observed purdah but held daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear. Among Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also rejoiced when she saw bankers, merchants, farmers and cultivators rise to levels of affluence, but did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to any of that wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right. She must, in fact, have financed all her activities with the lawful gains obtained from a happy and prosperous land. There are many stories of her care for her people. She helped widows retain their husbands’ wealth. She made sure that a widow was allowed to adopt a son; in fact, in one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The prime minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh. The only time Ahilyadevi seems not to have been able to settle a conflict peacefully and easily was in the case of the Bhils and Gonds, ""plunderers"" on her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give ""considerate attention to their habits"". Ahilyabai’s capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, Moropant and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar. Historians of the 19th and 20th centuries—Indian, English and American—agree that the reputation of Ahilyabai Holkar in Malwa and Maharashtra was then, and is, even now, that of a saint. Nothing has ever been discovered by any researcher to discredit that. She was truly a magnificent woman, an able ruler and a great queen. After her death, she was succeed by Tukojirao Holkar I, her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son Kashirao Holkar in 1797. Views about her. ""The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for 30 Yrs. This has become almost legendary as a period during which perfect order and good Government prevailed and the people prospered. She was a very able ruler and organizer, highly respected during her lifetime, and considered as a saint by a grateful people after her death."" An English poem written by Joanna Baillie in 1849 reads:  ""For thirty years her reign of peace, The land in blessing did increase; And she was blessed by every tongue, By stern and gentle, old and young. Yea, even the children at their mothers feet Are taught such homely rhyming to repeat ""In latter days from Brahma came, To rule our land, a noble Dame, Kind was her heart, and bright her fame, And Ahlya was her honoured name.""  ""The Great Maratha lady who affords the noblest example of wisdom, goodness and virtue. One english writer quoted that which Akbar is among male sovereigns, is Ahlia Baie among female sovereigns"". ""Ahilyabai's extraordinary ability won her the regard of her subjects and of the other Maratha confederates, including Nana Phadnavis. Collecting oral memories of her in the 1820s, Sir John Malcolm, the British official most directly concerned with the 'settlement' of central India, seems to have become deeply enamourned of her. ""With the natives of Malwa ... her name is sainted and she is styled an avatar or Incarnation of the Divinity. In the most sober view that can be taken of her character, she certainly appears, within her limited sphere, to have been one of the purest and most exemplary rulers that ever existed"". Her latest biographers call her 'The Philosopher Queen', a reference perhaps to the 'Philosopher king' Bhoj."" ""Ahilyabai Holkar, the 'philosopher-queen' of Malwa, had evidently been an acute observer of the wider political scene. In a letter to the peshwa in 1772 she had warned against association with the British, and likened their embrace to a bear-hug: ""Other beasts, like tigers, can be killed by might or contrivance, but to kill a bear it is very difficult. It will die only if you kill it straight in the face, Or else, once caught in its powerful hold, the bear will kill its prey by tickling. Such is the way of the English. And in view of this, it is difficult to triumph over them."" ""This great ruler in Indore encouraged all within her realm to do their best, Merchants produced their finest cloths, trade flourished, the farmers were at peace and oppression ceased, for each case that came to the queens notice was dealt with severely. She loved to see her people prosper, and to watch the fine cities grow, and to watch that her subjects were not afraid to display their wealth, lest the ruler should snatch it from them. Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travellers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans, were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse. Ahalya Bai was seventy years old when her long and splendid life closed. Indore long mourned its noble Queen, happy had been her reign, and her memory is cherished with deep reverence unto this day. ""From the original papers and letters, it becomes clear that she was first-class politician, and that was why she readily extended her support to Mahadji Shinde. I have no hesitation in saying that without the support of Ahilyabai, Mahadji would never have gained so much importance in the politics of northern India."" ""Definitely no woman and no ruler is like Ahilyabai Holkar."" ""It reveals beyond doubt that all ideal virtues described by Plato and Bhismacharya were present in her personality like Dilip, Janak, Shri Ram, Shri Krishna and Yudhishthir. After through scrutiny of the long history of the world we find only one personality of Lokmata Devi Ahilya that represents an absolutely ideal ruler."" Over the years, in independent India, the city of Indore, when compared to neighbouring Bhopal, Jabalpur or Gwalior, has progressed dramatically: economically, through business and financial prowess, politically and in all possible ways cities are supposed to progress. In fact, the local population proudly states that they live in 'mini-Mumbai', a reference to the great metropolis pulsing 600 km away. The good deeds of Devi Ahilyabai, her dedication to religion and her policies are enriching the city even today! The faith and belief in the good vibes of Indore go to such an extent that local inhabitants say that if you have lived in Indore for a thousand days, you are unlikely to leave it! Long live Devi Ahilya! A commemorative stamp was issued in her honour on 25 August 1996 by the Republic of India. As a tribute to the great ruler, Indore domestic airport has been named Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport. Similarly, Indore university has been renamed as ""Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya"". Works throughout India. It was the speciality of Holkar family that they did not use public funds to meet their personal and family expenses. They had their personal fund from their private property. Devi Ahilya inherited personal fund which at that time was estimated to be sixteen crores rupees. Ahilyabai used personal fund in charitable works. "
wikipedia-2278480," Hungarian pengő  The pengő (sometimes written as ""pengo"" or ""pengoe"" in English) was the currency of Hungary between 1 January 1927, when it replaced the korona, and 31 July 1946, when it was replaced by the forint. The pengő was subdivided into 100 fillér. Although the introduction of the pengő was part of a post-World War I stabilisation program, the currency survived only for 20 years and experienced the most serious hyperinflation ever recorded. Name. The Hungarian participle ""pengő"" means 'ringing' (which in turn derives from the verb ""peng"", an onomatopoeic word equivalent to English 'ring') and was used from the 15-17th century to refer to silver coins making a ringing sound when struck on a hard surface, thus indicating their precious metal content. (The onomatopoeic word used for gold coins is ""csengő"", an equivalent of English 'clinking' meaning a sharper sound; the participle used for copper coins is ""kongó"" meaning a deep pealing sound.) After the introduction of forint paper money in Hungary, the term ""pengő forint"" was used to refer to forint coins literally meaning 'ringing forint', figuratively meaning 'silver forint' or 'hard currency'. At the beginning of the First World War precious metal coins were recalled from circulation, and in the early 1920s all coins disappeared because of the heavy inflation of the Hungarian korona. The name ""pengő"" was probably chosen to suggest stability. However, there was some controversy when choosing the name of the new currency, though the majority agreed that a Hungarian name should be chosen. Proposals included ""turul"" (a bird from Hungarian mythology), ""turán"" (from the geographical name and ideological term Turan), ""libertás"" (the colloquial name of the poltura coins issued by Francis II Rákóczi), and ""máriás"" (the colloquial name of coins depicting Mary, patroness of Hungary). The denomination of the banknotes was indicated in the languages of ethnicities living in the territory of Hungary. The name of the currency was translated as follows: ""Pengö"" (pl. ""Pengö"") in German, ""pengő"" (pl. ""pengi"") in Slovak, ""пенгов"" (pl. ""пенгова"") in Cyrillic script Serbo-Croatian, ""пенгыв"" (pl. ""пенгывов"", later ""пенге"") in Rusyn, and ""pengő"" (pl. ""pengei"", later ""penghei"") in Romanian. Later ""pengov"" (pl. ""pengova""), the Latin script Serbo-Croatian version was also added. The symbol of the pengő was P and it was divided into 100 fillér (symbol: f). History. Introduction of the pengő. After the First World War, according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, the Austro-Hungarian Bank (the joint bank of the Monarchy) had to be liquidated and the Austro-Hungarian krone had to be replaced with a different currency, which in the case of Hungary was the Hungarian korona. This currency suffered a high rate of inflation during the early 1920s. A stabilisation program covered by League of Nations loan helped to bring down inflation, and the korona could be replaced in 1 January 1927 by a new currency, the ""pengő"", which was introduced by Act XXXV of 1925 It was valued at 12,500 korona, and defined as 3,800 to one kilogram of fine gold - which meant that the pengő was pegged to the gold standard, however, without exchange obligation. In the beginning the cover ratio (which included gold and - to 50% - foreign exchange) was fixed at 20% which had to be raised to 33.3% within 5 years. This goal was reached quickly: the cover ratio was 51% in 31 July 1930. Later it decreased somewhat due to the economic and financial crisis caused by the Great Depression. Until then the pengő was the most stable currency of the region. After the Great Depression. The effects of the Great Depression reached Hungary after 1930 and it hit predominantly agriculture. The pengő had to be devalued and the debt of the country increased. After a short period of recovery, the war preparations - amongst which the most important was the Győr-program - had loosened the financial and monetary discipline which in turn led to the depreciation of the pengő currency. The territories given back to Hungary by the Vienna Awards in 1938 and 1940 were economically less developed, which was an additional aggravating factor regarding the economic situation of the country. World War II. The war caused enormous costs and, later, even higher losses to the relatively small and open Hungarian economy. The national bank was practically under government control, the issue of money was proportional to the budget demands. By this time, silver coins disappeared from circulation, and, later, even bronze and cupro-nickel coins were replaced by coins made of cheaper metal. In the last act of the world war, the Szálasi government took control of banknote printing and issued notes without any cover, first in Budapest, then in Veszprém when Budapest had to be evacuated. The occupying Soviet army issued its own military money according to the Hague Conventions. Hyperinflation. The pengő lost value after World War II, suffering the highest rate of hyperinflation ever recorded. There were several attempts to break down inflation, such as a 75% capital levy in December 1945. However, this did not stop the hyperinflation and prices continued spiralling out of control, with ever higher denominations introduced. The denominations ""milpengő"" (1,000,000 pengő) and ""b.-pengő"" (pronunciation: ""bilpengő"") (1,000,000 milpengő, 1,000,000,000,000 pengő or one billion ""pengő"" (long scale)) were used to alleviate calculations, cut down the number of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed. Adópengő. The adópengő (lit. ""tax pengő"") was introduced on 1 January 1946 as an accounting unit for budget planning. However, from 8 July 1946, it was allowed to be used as a legal tender. It was intended to retain its value as the pengő's fell. However, although its value rose dramatically relative to the pengő (finally reaching 2 pengő), the adópengő nevertheless suffered severely from inflation. By July 1946, the adópengő became the only circulating currency as the pengő's value had fallen to such an extent that even the 100 million b.-pengő note was effectively worthless. End of the pengő. The Hungarian economy could only be stabilized by the introduction of a new currency, and therefore, on 1 August 1946, the forint was reintroduced at a rate of 400 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (400 octillion) = 4 pengő, dropping 29 zeroes from the old currency. In effect, the total amount of circulating pengő notes had a value of less than 0.1 fillér. A more realistic comparison was the exchange rate with the adópengő, which was set at 200 000 000 = 2 (hence the 2 ratio, mentioned above). The exchange rate for the US dollar was set at 11.74 forints. Coins. In 1926, 1, 2, 10, 20 and 50 fillér and 1 pengő coins were introduced. The 1 and 2 fillér pieces were bronze, the 10, 20 and 50 fillér were cupro-nickel and the 1 pengő coins were 64% silver. In 1929, 2 pengő coins were introduced, also in 64% silver. Commemorative 2 and 5 pengő coins were also issued on anniversaries, with a non-commemorative 5 pengő coin issued in 1939. During the Second World War, the 1 fillér ceased production, the 2 fillér coins were issued in steel and then zinc, the 10 and 20 fillér coins were minted in steel and the 1, 2 and 5 pengő pieces were of aluminium. In 1945, the provisional government issued aluminium 5 pengő coins which were the last coins issued before the hyperinflation. Paper money. The Hungarian National Bank issued the first series of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 pengő banknotes in the last days of 1926. These were offset prints on watermarked paper (except for the 5 pengő note). The banknotes featured the outstanding people of the Hungarian history on the obverse and either different sites of Budapest or paintings on the reverse: the banknotes also served education purposes. A new series of banknotes had to be printed soon to meet higher security standards. Since there was a lack of specialists in Hungary, the engraving was executed by Austrian professionals. New 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pengő notes were printed and even a 1000 pengő banknote was added to this series - however, the latter had such a high value that a big proportion of the people hardly ever saw any. This new series had almost the same topic as the previous. On the other hand, the 5 pengő notes were soon replaced with silver coins. After the Vienna Award, Hungary had to supply its recovered territories with money. Since increasing the amount of silver coins would have been too expensive, 1 and 5 pengő notes were issued in 1941 and 1938, respectively. These notes were of simple design and poor quality. Meanwhile, a series of new banknotes including 2, 5, 10 and 20 pengő denominations was issued. The design represented ornaments based on Hungarian folk art and people. At the end of the Second World War, the Szálasi government and the occupying Soviet army issued provisional notes in the territories under their power without any cover. In 1945 and 1946, hyperinflation caused the issuance of notes up to 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). During the hyperinflation, note designs were reused, changing the colour and replacing the word pengő with first milpengő, then b.-pengő, to generate higher denominations. The largest denomination produced was 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). The note was initially worth about US$ 0.20. Notes of one milliard b.-pengő (one sextillion or 1021 pengő) were printed but never issued. The introduction of adópengő was an attempt to keep inflation amongst limits, however, it could only slow down somewhat but did not stop the depreciation of the currency. Bonds were issued by the Ministry of Finance in denominations between 10 000 and 100 000 000 adópengő. These simple design notes on low-quality paper became legal currency in the last months of the Hyperinflation almost completely replacing pengő. The enormous amount of paper consumed during the production of the inflation pengő notes caused a shortage of good quality security paper; this hindered the production of forint banknotes. "
wikipedia-2278495," Economic torts  Economic torts, which are also called business torts, are torts that provide the common law rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve pure economic loss. The principal torts can be listed as passing off, injurious falsehood and trade libel (see also Food libel laws), conspiracy, inducement of breach of contract, tortious interference (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade), negligent misrepresentation, and watching and besetting. These torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers). Unfair competition application. Economic torts tortious interference actions to protect trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law and modern competition law, and certain laws governing intellectual property, particularly unfair competition law. The ""absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon."" Two cases demonstrated economic tort's affinity to competition and labour law. In ""Mogul Steamship Co Ltd"" the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this cartel was ruled lawful and ""nothing more a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade."" Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel. In English labour law the most notable case is ""Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants"". The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906 Further torts used against unions include conspiracy, interference with a commercial contract Recent developments. Several of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and ""tortious interference"" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords in the 2007 case of ""OBG Ltd v Allan"". This has, however, been confused somewhat by the subsequent House of Lords decision in ""Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Total Network SL"", which breathed new life into conspiracy by unlawful means.

wikipedia-2278526," Chris-Craft Boats  Chris-Craft Boats, formerly Smith and Sons Boat Company, is a defunct manufacturer of wooden boats. It was sold in 1960 to NAFI which would take the Chris-Craft name.  History. Chris Smith built his first wooden boat in 1874 at the age of 13. Years later, he built a duck hunting boat. His friends liked the way he built them, and they asked him to build them one. This was technically the start of the Chris Craft Boat Co. He soon began to build more boats and joined his brother Hank in 1881 to begin producing boats full time. In 1922, the brothers joined with other partners to form the Smith and Sons Boat Company. The company name was changed to Chris-Craft in 1930.  The Detroit area company became well known for their sleek racing boats in the 1910s and 1920s. Chris-Craft sold high end powerboats to wealthy patrons such as Henry Ford and William Randolph Hearst. In the late 1920s, Chris-Craft extended its market into the middle class when it became one of the first mass producers of civilian pleasure boats. The company began assembly line production at their Algonac, Michigan plant, dramatically lowering production costs. Formerly, most powerboats had been hand-built.  In 1927 the company introduced the ""Cadet,"" an affordable 22' runabout. At the time, the domain of speedboats was largely confined to the wealthy. Its innovative advertising campaign promised a piece of ""the good life"" to the growing American middle class. The company sold its boats on the installment plan, making them among the first powerboats available to the general population.  The Great Depression robbed many Americans of discretionary income, and Chris-Craft sales suffered. The company introduced a line of low-priced powerboats to stay solvent. By 1935, a 15.5' Utility boat sold for as little as US$406. During World War II, the company produced small patrol boats and launches for the U.S. Navy.  After the war, Chris Craft introduced a new lineup of civilian pleasure boats in time for the massive American consumer expansion of the 1950s. That decade marked the height of company prestige and the brand name Chris-Craft became virtually synonymous with pleasure boating. The company offered 159 different models and was the sales leader in many categories of small civilian powerboats.  The company sold high-end boats to famous customers such as Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. Their boats were often made from the finest mahogany and were considered to be among the best available. They were easy to operate, a must for their ""weekend sailor"" owners. In some circles, owning a Chris-Craft was considered ""de rigueur."" Even their lower-priced boats were considered to be of high quality, often featuring such luxury items as a liberal use of mahogany, teak, and brass. In 1957, Chris-Craft Corporation added a metal boat division, designated the Roamer Steel Boats Division (RSBD)—founded upon its purchase of the Roamer Boat Company, now known as Chris Craft Roamers. The company continued to be independent until it was acquired by Shields & Company's NAFI Corporation in 1960 and merged with NAFI. They renamed the company Chris-Craft Industries, Incorporated in 1962. "

wikipedia-2278554," Sally Potter  Charlotte Sally Potter, OBE (born 19 September 1949) is an English film director and screenwriter. Early life. Potter was born and raised in London. Her mother was a music teacher and her father was an interior designer and a poet. Her younger brother Nic became the bassist for the rock group Van der Graaf Generator. When asked about her background, which influenced her work as a filmmaker, she responds, ""I came from an atheist background and an anarchist background, which meant that I grew up in an environment that was full of questions, where nothing could be taken for granted."" Career. Potter began making amateur films, at age 14, with an 8mm camera given to her by an uncle. She eventually dropped out of school at age 16 to pursue filmmaking. From 1968-1970 she worked as a kitchen worker and a picture researcher for BBC in order to support herself and her work. She had joined the London Film-Makers' Co-op and began making experimental short films, including ""Jerk"" (1969) and ""Play"" (1970). She later trained as a dancer and choreographer at the London School of Contemporary Dance. She made both film and dance pieces, including ""Combines"" (1972), before founding Limited Dance Company with Jacky Lansley. Potter became an award-winning performance artist and theatre director, with shows including ""Mounting"", ""Death and the Maiden"" and ""Berlin"". In addition, she was a member of several music bands (including Feminist Improvising Group and The Film Music Orchestra) working as a lyricist and singer. She collaborated (as a singer-songwriter) with composer Lindsay Cooper on the song cycle ""Oh Moscow,"" which was performed throughout Europe, Russia and North America in the late 1980s and commercially released.  Potter continued as a composer when she collaborated with David Motion on the soundtrack to ""Orlando."" She wrote the score for the film, ""The Tango Lesson,"" for which she sang ""I am You"" in the final scene. Her most recent music work is as producer and co-composer with Fred Frith of the original tracks for ""Yes"" and ""Rage"".  Referring to her career as a choreographer, Potter said, ""Choreography was the perfect 'poor theatre.' All you needed were willing bodies and some space. So it was as a choreographer that I learnt how to direct and it was as a dancer that I learnt how to work."" Potter returned to filmmaking with her short film ""Thriller"" (1979), which was a hit on the international festival circuit. This was followed by her first feature film, ""The Gold Diggers"" (1983), starring Julie Christie. She directed another short film, ""The London Story"" (1986); a documentary series for Channel 4, ""Tears"", ""Laughter"", ""Fear and Rage"" (1986); and ""I am an Ox"", ""I am a Horse"", ""I am a Man"", ""I am a Woman"" (1988), a film about women in Soviet cinema. As director of the internationally distributed ""Orlando"" (1992), Potter received greater appreciation for her writing and direction. Starring Tilda Swinton, the film was based on Virginia Woolf’s and adapted for the screen by Potter. In addition to two Academy Award nominations, ""Orlando"" won more than 25 international awards, including the Felix, awarded by the European Film Academy for the best Young European Film of 1993; and first prizes at St Petersburg, Thessaloniki and other European festivals.  The novel had previously been considered impossible to adapt for the screen, because it took place over 400 years and followed a character whose sex changes from a man to a woman. Funding the feature proved difficult, and ""Orlando"" took seven years to complete. Filming and editing took 20 weeks. Preparation for the film, including adapting the novel, funding the film, scouting locations, etc., took four years.  ""Orlando"" is often considered a feminist film; however, Potter denies that label. She said in an interview,""I have come to the conclusion that I can't use that term in my work. Not because of a disavowal of the underlying principles that gave birth to that word – the commitment to liberation, dignity, equality. But it has become a trigger word that stops people's thinking. You literally see people's eyes glaze over with exhaustion when the word flashes into the conversation.”Potter claims that the story shows the difficulties both of being a man and of a being a woman.  Her next directed the film, ""The Tango Lesson"" (1996), in which she also performed with renowned dancer Pablo Veron. First presented at the Venice Film Festival, the film was awarded the ""Ombú de Oro"" for Best Film at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the SADAIC Great Award from the Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música; as well as receiving Best Film nominations from BAFTA and the US National Board of Review. ""The Tango Lesson"" is semi-autobiographical, based on Potter's experiences learning Argentinian Tango with Veron while writing the screenplay for ""Rage.""  ""The Tango Lesson"" marks Potter's first time performing on screen. Regarding this decision she stated, ""I knew that I had to perform in this one because the impetus for the film came out of my own desire to dance.” Potter's professional collaborations with Pablo Veron continue in ""The Man Who Cried"" and the stage production of ""Carmen"" (2007). ""The Man Who Cried"" (starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett and John Turturro), premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2000.  It was followed by ""Yes"" (2004), with Joan Allen, Simon Abkarian and Sam Neill. ""Yes"" was written in response to the attacks in the United States of September 11, 2001; it is considered Potter's return to more experimental methods of filmmaking. The screenplay is written in verse and the film's budget was much smaller than that for ""The Man Who Cried"". Regarding the film's budget and stylistic approaches, Potter has said, ""Originally I was trying to figure out how we could shoot this film without any lights, because there didn't seem to be enough money in the budget to have any. One solution was to shoot at six frames a second, or even three. Later you print each frame four (or eight) times to bring it into sync at twenty-four frames per second. You can shoot almost in the dark, and still see people's faces...we did some tests and found that it was very beautiful; so I decided to make it part of the language of the film."" In 2007 Potter directed Bizet’s ""Carmen"" for English National Opera at the London Coliseum, starring Alice Coote and designed by Es Devlin. ""Rage"" (2009) was the first feature ever to premiere on cell-phones. The cast includes Judi Dench, Steve Buscemi, Lily Cole and Jude Law. ""Rage"" was in competition at the Berlin Film Festival in 2009 and nominated for a WEBBY for Best Drama in 2010. Potter's seventh feature film entitled Ginger & Rosa was written and directed by Potter and produced by Christoper Sheppard and Andrew Lityin. The film starred Elle Fanning and Alice Englert as the titular characters and received its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival. The film went into limited release in the UK in 2012 before enjoying a limited run in North America in early 2013.  Awards and honours.

wikipedia-2278606," Eternal Warrior  Gilad Anni-Padda, aka the Eternal Warrior is the title character of a 50-issue comic book series by Valiant Comics that ran from 1992 to 1996. ""Eternal Warrior"" was relaunched with the other Valiant characters under the banner of Acclaim Comics in 1996 (video game company Acclaim Entertainment purchased Valiant Comics for $65 million in June 1994). Valiant Entertainment, Inc. is the owner of the Valiant catalog (including Eternal Warrior). Publication history. The series was originally written by Jim Shooter with art by John Dixon. Later writers included Kevin VanHook, Barry Windsor-Smith, Mark Moretti, and John Ostrander. Months following Valiant Entertainment's successful relaunch a new Eternal Warrior series titled ""Wrath of the Eternal Warrior"" was teased at the Baltimore Comic- Con in September 2012. Fictional character biography. One of three natural human immortals, Gilad is the brother of Ivar the Timewalker and Aram the Other (AKA Armstrong). The three brothers are the only naturally immortal humans known to exist. He serves as the ""Fist and Steel"" of the Geomancers and has served them for millennia. Like his brothers, Gilad has superhuman strength (though not as great as Aram's) and stamina, as well as a healing ability which allows him to regenerate tissue damaged by virtually any wound. Gilad's people once said that he carried within him the ""Leopard Spirit."" Bravest of a warrior tribe, Gilad Anni-Padda was born in 3268 BC. His skill at battlecraft and the arts of stealth are great, as he has honed them throughout the ages. With an ultra-dense cellular structure that gives him great strength and the ability to heal from the most grievous of wounds, Gilad Anni-Padda is even immune to the ravages of time. The greatest fighter from an age when the sword was the law, he was ancient before the rise of the Pharaohs, and shall survive the fall of nations yet to come. He is the Fist and Steel of those who guard the Earth - the Geomancers, and his battle is never-ending. In 3257 BC, at the age of eleven, Gilad emerged victorious from his first battle. In 3250, Gilad's first son, Kalam, was born. In 3219 BC, Gilad and Aram's tribe battled the superior weaponry of the Mesopotamians and lost, with the warriors of Mesopotamia advancing to Gilad's camp. All of the people were killed with the exception of Gilad, Aram, and Kalam. The brothers split up, Gilad traveling with the Geomancer of the day and Aram seeking a new family and a less violent life. Centuries passed and the brothers saw each other on occasion but have largely led separate lives. In 210 BC, Gilad first battled the Immortal Enemy, then known as General Cheng, who can reincarnate through the ages, always doing evil and seeking Gilad's destruction. Every time the Immortal Enemy reincarnates his eyes remain the same, one green and the other brown. In World War II, Gilad meets Neville Alcott at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. Alcott would later serve to aid the Eternal Warrior's causes. In the early 1990s, Gilad (now known as Gilad Abrams) fought the Immortal Enemy's latest incarnation, a Colombian drug lord Juan Javier Caldone. Gilad has also incurred the enmity of Master Darque - necromancer supreme. During the Unity crisis it is seen that Gilad will still be active in 4000 A.D., battling alongside Magnus, Robot Fighter. Magnus fights to protect his society threats arising from free-will robots.  Powers. Classic Valiant. Like his siblings, Ivar and Aram, Gilad's dense molecular structure not only renders him immortal, but also grants him super-strength, some invulnerability, and a regenerative healing process. His millennia of life has also made him a master of all known combat and weaponry. "
wikipedia-2278611," Fibril  Fibril is a fine fiber, such as a myofibril or neurofibril. Neurofilaments are about 10 nanometers in diameter.  Cytoplasmic fibrils are observed on the protoplasmic cylinders found in most spirochetal species, although no function of the cytoplasmic fibrils has been ascribed. Polysaccharides, the union of several linked monosaccharides, sometimes serve as a structural compound. Cellulose, the most abundant organic compound on Earth, forms cable-like strings, known as fibrils in the tough walls that enclose plant cells. While cellulose is a compilation of glucose monomers, they form unbranched, long strands instead of coils like starch or glycogen. These are arranged in parallel lines which form on top of each other in an intricate layer through hydrogen bonding. Insect flight muscle is said to be fibrillar, in that it contracts in response to being stretched by antagonistic muscle, so as to allow very rapid (up to 1000 Hz) contraction. "

wikipedia-2278642," Har Homa  Har Homa (, lit ""Wall Mountain"", officially Homat Shmuel) is an Israeli settlement in southern East Jerusalem, near Beit Sahour. Built on land annexed to the Jerusalem municipality by Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, it is considered by much of the world an illegal Israeli settlement, although Israel disputes this. The neighborhood was officially renamed Homat Shmuel in 1998 after Shmuel Meir, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, who played an active role in its development before he was killed in a car accident in 1996. In 2011, Har Homa had a population of 13,000. History. In the 1940s a Jewish group purchased 130 dunams (32 acres) of land on the hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem known in Arabic as ""Jabal Abu Ghneim,"" , translit). During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the hill was a base for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a position taken over by Jordan's Arab Legion. The Hebrew name ""Har Homa"" refers to a wall built on the remains of a Byzantine church on the mountain which was visible to Palmach forces stationed at Kibbutz Ramat Rahel. Following the war, the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property planted a pine forest there to prevent misuse of the land by local Jordanian residents. Since 1967, the forest has been maintained by the Jewish National Fund. Plans for residential development were drawn up in the 1980s, but were opposed by Israeli environmental groups working to preserve the open areas in Jerusalem. In 1991, Israeli Cabinet Minister Yitzhak Moda'i approved expropriation of land on the forested hill for a new building project. Prime Minister Shimon Peres initially approved construction plans for Jewish homes on the site, but postponed the groundbreaking ceremony to avoid conflict with Palestinians who were seeking to overturn the decision in the Israeli courts. Construction began only in March 1997, during the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu, who saw the construction of homes in Har Homa as a legitimate expansion of Jerusalem. Controversy. Israeli officials acknowledge that some Palestinian land was expropriated for the Har Homa neighborhood, but say that nearly 80 percent of the land taken for the project belonged to Jews. According to another source, 75% of the land was expropriated from Israelis. Israel says Har Homa is within the city limits of Jerusalem and most of the land was owned by Jews prior to its conquest by Jordan in 1948. Furthermore, the land was unoccupied and undeveloped prior to the current construction; both Jewish and Arab landholders were compensated for the land; and residents of Beit Sahour would not be able to develop the land in any event as the Oslo agreements specifically barred Palestinian jurisdiction over Jerusalem for the time being, and also excluded settlements as an issue, leaving it for permanent status negotiations. Residents of Beit Sahour, in conjunction with Israeli peace activists, campaigned against the decision to build Har Homa neighborhood, setting up what they called an ""international peace camp"" at the site. Most of the residents of Har Homa today are young families who moved there in search of affordable housing. When the Jerusalem Municipality approved the initial 2,500 housing units in Har Homa, it also approved 3,000 housing units and 400 government financed housing units in the Arab neighborhood of Sur Baher, which faces Har Homa. The plans were drawn up in 1994, but the approval process was stepped up in May 1997 as a counterbalance to Jewish development at Har Homa Palestinian officials dismissed the project as a ploy aimed at deflecting international criticism. After failing to stop the development of the site, the residents of Beit Sahour have petitioned Israeli Supreme Court to return the undeveloped land between Beit Sahour and Har Homa to the Palestinian municipality, and to move the security fence to reflect their ownership of this land. Views of U.S. administration. In 1997, the U.S. vetoed two UN Security Council resolutions that called on Israel to stop construction work. The U.S. was the only country of the 15 members on the council to vote against the resolution (Jerusalem Post, 3/9/97). In a vote of 134 to 3, the United States, along with Israel and Micronesia, were the only countries among the 185 members in the UN General Assembly to vote against an April 1997 resolution demanding an immediate halt to construction at Har Homa. The previous month, a similar resolution condemning Israeli activity at Har Homa was passed 130 to 2, with only the U.S. and Israel voting against it (The Times, 4/26/97). While the United States has traditionally refrained from describing Jerusalem neighborhoods as settlements, in 2008, Condoleezza Rice was critical of building tenders in Har Homa announced after the Annapolis meeting. She described Har Homa as ""a settlement the United States has opposed from the very beginning."" In November 2010 the United States criticized Israeli plans to build new housing units in Har Homa. View of the European Union. In 2011, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she was disappointed to hear that Israel was planning to expand Har Homa. She said in a statement that “the European Union has repeatedly urged the government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem (...) All settlement activities are illegal under international law.” "
wikipedia-2278666," Pastoral counseling  Pastoral counseling is a branch of counseling in which psychologically trained ministers, rabbis, priests, imams, and other persons provide therapy services. Pastoral counselors often integrate modern psychological thought and method with traditional religious training in an effort to address psychospiritual issues in addition to the traditional spectrum of counseling services. Distinctiveness. ""What distinguishes pastoral counseling from other forms of counseling and psychotherapy is the role and accountability of the counselor and his or her understanding and expression of the pastoral relationship. Pastoral counselors are representatives of the central images of life and its meaning affirmed by their religious communities. Thus pastoral counseling offers a relationship to that understanding of life and faith. Pastoral counseling uses both psychological and theological resources to deepen its understanding of the pastoral relationship."" Membership in several organizations that combine theology and mental health has grown in recent years. Some pastoral counselors have developed special training programs to encourage cooperation between religious professionals and medical professionals on treatment of issues like addiction, since spirituality is an important part of recovery for many people. History. Pastoral counseling had its beginnings a separate discipline in North America in the first half of the twentieth century, as various religious organizations began to incorporate the insights and training of psychiatry, psychology and social work into the training of clergy. In 1925, Dr. Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct at Harvard Divinity School, published an article in the ""Survey Graphic"" suggesting that every candidate for the ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students. In the 1930s, the Rev. Anton Boisen began a program of placing theological students in supervised contact with mental patients. In time, many seminaries and other training programs for religious professionals began to include clinical pastoral education as part of clerical training. Also in the 1930s, the minister Norman Vincent Peale and the psychiatrist, Dr. Smiley Blanton, collaborated to form the American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, now known as the Blanton-Peale Institute. Today, hundreds of mental health centers with links to specific religious traditions may be found across North America. In 1963, the American Association of Pastoral Counselors was founded to provide professional certification for pastoral counselors and pastoral counseling centers. "
wikipedia-2308888," Yamaha Diversion  Yamaha Diversion motorcycles are a series of all-round touring motorcycles descended from Yamaha's earlier XJ series. Early Diversion models were fitted with a four-stroke air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine. In 2009 the marque was retained for a new range with 16-valve liquid-cooled engines. Diversion models. Before the introduction of the 2009 models the series consisted of four main models; the XJ600S, XJ600N, XJ900S and XJ900GT. The XJ600S Diversion/Seca II. The XJ600S is known as the ""Diversion"" in most parts of the world but as the ""Seca II"" in the North American and Australian markets. The bike has a small top fairing although a lower fairing is available as an accessory. The XJ600S is a descendant of the Yamaha XJ600 models manufactured between 1984 and 1991. It is fitted with a 598cc, air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine giving 61 hp (45kW) / 55 Nm output. The engine from the original XJ600 model was tuned towards improved low- and midrange power, sacrificing some peak power. 600cc Diversion models were manufactured from 1992 to 2004. US Seca IIs were manufactured from 1992 to 1998. As the Diversion/Seca II design is based on an earlier, well-matured model, changes made to the bike during these years were rather subtle, mostly concerning improvements in fairing: a second front-brake disc and small oil cooler appeared on the 1998 model along with improvements to the carburettors. The Diversion features a more standard riding position than most 600cc sport bikes, making it usable for commuting. It remained in production for quite a long time, perhaps due to its all-round affordability including low price, modest fuel consumption, longevity and reliability. The XJ600N. The XJ600N is almost identical to the XJ600S except that it is a naked bike: the dashboard is different from the XJ600S, as it turns with the handlebars. This model was not sold in North America. The XJ900S/XJ900GT. The XJ900 is a descendant of the earlier Yamaha XJ900 model. The XJ900S and the XJ900GT are both the same basic motorcycle except the GT,typically for touring motorcycles, has a large fairing and two Krauser K2 panniers while the XJ900S has a small top fairing like the XJ600S. On the dashboard (wider than that of the 600cc models) there are some extra gauges such as a fuel gauge. It is a sports/touring machine fitted with a 892cc, air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine giving 89 hp / 85 Nm output. The XJ900S/GT has a driveshaft while the 600cc models are chain driven. The poor front suspension springs can be replaced with progressive ones. The XJ900S/GT is known as ""Diversion 900"" on the European market. In the United States the bike appeared as the 1983 Seca XJ900RK. Police versions. The Yamaha Diversion has been used as a police motorcycle all over the world. Such models are built by Yamaha to the specifications of individual police departments. Generally the XJ900S is chosen for police use but the XJ600S has also been used. Police spec. Diversions are commonly referred to as XJ900P (P for Police) although Yamaha refers to them by their usual model designation (XJ900S or XJ600S) as they do not constitute a separate model. XJ6 Diversion / XJ6 N / XJ6 Diversion F. In 2009 Yamaha re-launched the Diversion line in the form of the XJ6 Diversion and XJ6 N. The former has a half-fairing while the N version is a naked motorcycle. The engine is a detuned Fazer engine and both versions are offered with optional ABS braking. The new line has upgraded to a liquid-cooled 16 valve 4-stroke forward-inclined parallel 4-cylinder engine developing 78 horsepower (57 kW) / 59.7 Nm. Yamaha has kept the engine displacement at 600cc for the new Diversion line. "
wikipedia-2308892," Owney Madden  Owney ""The Killer"" Madden (December 18, 1891 – April 24, 1965) was a leading underworld figure in Manhattan, most notable for his involvement in organized crime during Prohibition. He also ran the famous Cotton Club and was a leading boxing promoter in the 1930s. Early life. Owen Vincent Madden was born at 25 Somerset Street in Leeds, England on December 18, 1891, the son of Francis and Mary Madden (nee O'Neil). In search of work, the family moved first to Wigan, then to Liverpool. It was Francis' intention to take the family to the United States, but he died before this ambition could be fulfilled. In 1901, Mary Madden sailed to New York on the ""RMS Oceanic"", to stay with her widowed sister Elizabeth O'Neil, at 352 10th Avenue, in Manhattan. Owen and his older brother, Martin, were left at a children's home, at 36 Springfield Terrace, in Leeds, until 1902, when Mary could finally afford passage for them. Owen maintained a sentimentality for his native Yorkshire and England throughout his life, refusing to give up his British passport until the 1950s, when he was threatened with deportation. Unlike his elder brother Martin, who adopted a New York drawl, Owney kept his Northern English accent and saved clippings from the ""Yorkshire Post"" until he died. Gopher Gang. On June 4, 1902, Madden, together with his brother Martin and his younger sister Mary, sailed from Liverpool as steerage passengers on board the ""SS Teutonic"". Settling in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Madden joined the Gopher Gang later that year. Described by associates as ""that banty little rooster from hell"", Madden quickly became a fierce fighter, known for his skill with a lead pipe and gun in fights with rivals the Hudson Dusters. Madden gained the nickname ""the Killer"" after gunning down an Italian gang member in the streets, after which he shouted, ""Owney Madden, 10th Avenue!"" Despite the public nature of the murder, no witnesses came forward linking Madden to the crime.  By 1910, at age 18, Madden had become a prominent member of the Gophers and was suspected in the deaths of five rival gang members. His reputation soon gained him leadership of one of the three factions of the Gophers. He was earning as much as $200 a day from the Gophers' criminal activities, such as the gang's protection racket which forced local businessmen to pay in the face of firebomb threats. During this time, Madden enjoyed an opulent lifestyle, and he was often accompanied by several women. However, he became known for his violent jealousy when he shot and killed a store clerk named William Henshaw, who had asked out one of Madden's girls while on board a trolley. Henshaw initially survived the attack and identified Madden as his assailant. When Henshaw later died of his wounds, police arrested Madden. Though the attack had numerous witnesses, the case had to be dismissed after no corroborating witnesses came forward. Over the next three years, the Gophers reached the height of their power as Madden recruited various gunmen into the gang. As Madden began encroaching into rivals' territory, particularly the Hudson Dusters, he was ambushed and shot eleven times outside a 52nd Street dance hall by three members of the Dusters, on November 6, 1912. Madden survived the attack, however, and refused to identify his attackers to police, stating ""Nothing doing. The boys'll get 'em. It's nobody's business but mine who put these slugs in me!"" Within a week of his release, several members of the Dusters had been killed.  In 1914, Madden became involved in a dispute with Little Patsy Doyle, a prominent member of the Dusters, over a woman named Freda Horner. In a breach of Irish gangland ethics, Doyle informed police of Madden's operations. Following Doyle's assault on Madden's close friend, Tony Romanello, Madden arranged for Doyle's murder. Madden relayed a message to Doyle through Margaret Everdeane (a friend of Freda Horner) to meet him, supposedly in order to reconcile. As Doyle arrived on November 28, 1914, Madden ambushed Doyle and killed him. The police questioned Horner and Everdeane, who both confessed to their roles in the killing. Madden was eventually sentenced to 20 years at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. Prohibition. After serving nine years of his sentence, Madden was released on parole in 1923. The Gopher gang had broken up, and many members of his own faction were either in Sing Sing or working for bootlegging gangs.  Upon his release he was given a job by an old friend, a former member of Madden's street gang who had moved up to better things. Larry Fay had a sharp mind for crime, however he was not the most physically imposing of gangsters and he needed Madden's muscle to help establish the taxi business he had set up from profits he had made running Canadian whisky across the border during the early days of Prohibition. Fay employed a gang of strong-arm men to help him gain control of the most profitable cab-stands along Broadway and Madden became their leader. Later Fay also became involved in New York's milk trade, attempting to turn its delivery into a racket. Owney Madden learned quickly and soon moved on to form his own organization. During this time, Madden employed a young friend as a personal driver. The driver, George Raft, later became a film star noted for his authentic portrayals of gangland figures. Fay had used Prohibition as a means to raise money for other ventures, but Madden saw it as too good an opportunity to pass up, and soon became heavily involved in bootlegging, establishing a territory in the Hells Kitchen area. In 1924 the Madden gang began highjacking liquor shipments belonging to Big Bill Dwyer, but rather than go to war Dwyer took Madden on as a partner, when Dwyer decided he needed to beef up the enforcement side of his own operations. The Cotton Club. Madden and his former gang rival turned partner, Big Frenchy De Mange (George Fox DeMange), began to open or acquire some of the flashiest speakeasies and nightclubs of the era, most notably the legendary Cotton Club.  Madden purchased the Club De Luxe from former Heavyweight Boxing Champion Jack Johnson and reopened it a year later. Nightclub patrons flooded into Harlem from downtown Manhattan to catch performers such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and the Nicholas Brothers.  Madden and his partners, Big Bill and Big Frenchy, also muscled their way into a piece of the exclusive Stork Club, where the influential gossip columnist Walter Winchell held court and everyone who was anyone wanted to see and be seen. As a celebrity nightclub owner with ownership in more than twenty clubs, Madden became well-known and glamorized for his Prohibition-era activities. He also gained recognition for his revenge tactics and payoffs of City Hall. Boxing. In 1931, shortly before the end of Prohibition, Madden got out of bootlegging and entered into partnership with boxing promoters, ""Broadway"" Bill Duffy and George Jean ""Big Frenchie"" DeMange. Between them, they controlled the careers of several boxing champions including Max Baer and Primo Carnera. As Carnera's manager, Madden arranged fixed fights which led eventually to Carnera's winning the NBA World Heavyweight Championship, in 1933. Carnera held onto the title for nearly a year, until reporters' suspicions about fixed fights led Madden to desert the Italian strongman, setting up Carnera's famous defeat at the hands of Baer on June 14, 1934. Exile in Hot Springs. In 1932, Madden was involved in the murder of Vincent ""Mad Dog"" Coll, who had been extorting money from several mobsters, including DeMange and Madden. After being arrested for a parole violation that same year, Madden began facing greater harassment from police and encroachment on his territory by Italian Mafia families, until he finally left New York in 1935. Leaving behind racketeering, Madden settled in Hot Springs, Arkansas which had become known as a haven for various criminals, with a corrupt city government and police force. Madden opened the Southern Club, a casino and supper club, in 1935. He also became involved in local criminal activities, especially illegal gambling. The Southern Club became a popular nightspot for mobsters; Charles Luciano was apprehended there in 1935. Madden became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1943, and eventually married the daughter of the city postmaster. He lived in Hot Springs until his death in 1965. "
wikipedia-2308901," Emerson Thome  Emerson Augusto Thome (born 30 March 1972), simply known as Emerson Thome, or commonly known as Paredão is a retired Brazilian footballer who played as a central defender. Career. He first came to England towards the end of the 1997–98 season when moving to from Portuguese club Benfica, who signed him from Tirsense in 1994–95, when the ""jesuítas"" stood one win away from a UEFA Cup position. Whilst at Hillsborough he became a huge favourite with the Wednesday supporters who nicknamed him ""The Wall"" due to his physical presence and powerful style – which was recovered from his stint at Tirsense. Thome scored twice for Wednesday, once against Stockport County in the FA Cup and once against Wimbledon in the league. In late 1999, with the Owls staring at the prospect of possible relegation in the face, he made the move to for a fee of £2.7 million. He was to remain at Stamford Bridge for just nine months, as he found it hard to break up the tried and tested central defensive partnership of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. Just one game into the 2000–2001 season Thome was sold to Premiership rivals for a fee of around £4 million, quite a considerable profit for the Londoners. He was replaced by Winston Bogarde, a move widely regarded as one of the most disastrous transfers of all time. The sale of Thome was reputedly not sanctioned by Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who left the club a short time later. During his time at the Stadium of Light, Thome struggled with injuries and Sunderland were reluctant to extend his contract. A clause in his contract with Sunderland meant that a considerable sum had to be paid to Chelsea after he played 50 matches. Sunderland were not willing to pay the extra appearance based fee, hence their reasons for not playing Thome towards the end of the 2002–2003 season, a campaign which ended in relegation heartbreak. Thome scored twice for Sunderland, netting in league games against Coventry City and Aston Villa. In August 2003, Thome joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer, and became a regular campaigner for the Trotters as they finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the League Cup where they lost to Middlesbrough at the Millennium Stadium. In the summer of 2004, he moved to Championship side Wigan Athletic along with former Bolton team-mate Per Frandsen. Thome was part of the Wigan side which were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history in 2005. His second season with the ""Latics"" saw him face less playing time which resulted in Thome being loaned out to Championship side Derby County for several months. Once Thome loan had expired with Derby County, he returned to Wigan Athletic where on the 7 February 2006, the ""Latics"" decided to release him from his contract. Following his release by Wigan, Thome joined Japanese side Vissel Kobe where he remained their for two seasons. In 2007, Thome announced his retirement from professional football. Since his retirement from the beautiful game, Thorne has been working for Everton F.C. as a chief scout in Portugal since late 2008. "
wikipedia-2308910," It Takes a Village  It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us is a book published in 1996 by First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton. In it, Clinton presents her vision for the children of America. She focuses on the impact individuals and groups outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being, and advocates a society which meets all of a child's needs. History. In January 1996, Clinton went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book, although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies. Her efforts were rewarded; the book sold well and spent time on the New York Times Best Seller list during 1996.  The theme of the book, at least as perceived from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. The most famous instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election: during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, nominee Bob Dole said: ""... with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child."" In 1997, Clinton received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for her audio recording of the book.  The book is parodied in Tim Wilson's 1999 song ""It Takes a Village to Raise a Nut"". In 2005, Senator Rick Santorum wrote a rebuke to the book, ""It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good"". In 2006, ""It Takes a Village"" was republished as a ""10th Anniversary Edition"" with a new cover design and an introduction by the author. Clinton did not shy away from its conclusions; during her own presidential campaign in 2007, she said ""I still believe it takes a village to raise a child."" Proverb question. The book's title is attributed to an African proverb: ""It takes a village to raise a child."" The saying and its attribution as an ""African"" proverb were in circulation before it was adopted by Clinton as the source for the title of her book. Indeed, the saying previously provided the source for the title of a children's book entitled ""It Takes a Village"" by Jane Cowen-Fletcher, published in 1994.  The authenticity of the proverb is debatable as there is no evidence that this precise proverb genuinely originated with any African culture. However, numerous proverbs from different cultures across Africa have been noted that convey similar sentiments in different ways. As one poster on a scholarly list wrote, ""While it is interesting to seek provenance in regard to the proverb, 'It takes a village to raise a child,' I think it would be misleading to ascribe its origin to a single source... Let me give a few examples of African societies with proverbs which translate to 'It takes a village...': In Lunyoro (Banyoro) there is a proverb that says 'Omwana takulila nju emoi,' whose literal translation is 'A child does not grow up only in a single home.' In Kihaya (Bahaya) there is a saying, 'Omwana taba womoi,' which translates as 'A child belongs not to one parent or home.' In Kijita (Wajita) there is a proverb which says 'Omwana ni wa bhone,' meaning regardless of a child's biological parent(s) its upbringing belongs to the community. In Swahili, the proverb 'Asiyefunzwa na mamae hufunzwa na ulimwengu' approximates to the same.""  Ghostwriter controversy. Clinton has been criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in connection with ""It Takes a Village"". The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman. When the book was first announced in April 1995, ""The New York Times"" reported publisher Simon & Schuster as saying ""The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text."" Feinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work. Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book. Clinton's acknowledgment section began: ""It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out."" During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, ""I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word."" Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of ""connecting paragraphs"", while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand. This led Feinman to complain at the time to ""Capitol Style"" magazine over the lack of acknowledgement.  In 2001, ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported that ""New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton's refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book."" Later, in a 2002 article for ""The Writer's Chronicle"", Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, ""Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible."" Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that ""It Takes a Village"" was one of ""several high-profile books"" that she has ""assisted, as editor, writer and researcher.""

wikipedia-2308939," Mercadier  Mercadier (died 1200) was a ""French"" Provençal warrior of the 12th century, and chief of mercenaries in the service of Richard I of England. In 1183 he appears as a leader of Brabant mercenaries in Southern France. He entered Richard's service in 1184, attacking and laying waste to lands of Aimar V of Limoges. In 1188 he managed seventeen castles captured from the Count of Toulouse. He accompanied Richard on the Third Crusade but was sent back when Philip Augustus left for France. On arrival he and his mercenaries defended Richard's estates in the latter's absence. After Richard's return from the Holy Land, Mercadier accompanied him everywhere as his right hand, travelling and fighting by his side. Richard eulogized Mercadier's exploits in his letters, and gave him the estates left by Ademar de Bainac in Limousin, who died without heirs around 1190. During the various wars between Richard and Philip Augustus of France, Mercadier fought successively in Berry, Normandy, Flanders and Brittany. When Richard was mortally wounded at the siege of Châlus in March 1199, it was Mercadier's physician who cared for him. Mercadier avenged his death by storming the castle, hanging the defenders and flaying Pierre Basile, the crossbowman who had shot the king, despite Richard's last act pardoning the boy. Mercadier then entered the service of John, and ravaged Gascony and the city of Angers. On Easter Monday, the 10th April, 1200, he was assassinated while on a visit to Bordeaux to pay his respects to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was bringing from Spain Blanche of Castile. His murderer was a man-at-arms employed by Brandin, a rival mercenary captain in the service of John. One of the bridges of the Chateau-Gaillard is named for him. In historical fiction.

wikipedia-2308988," Kentucky Route 9  Kentucky Route 9 (KY 9) is a state highway maintained by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The route runs from Newport (a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio) to Grayson, roughly paralleling the Ohio River between Newport and Vanceburg. Most of its route, from the Interstate 275 loop at Wilder to Grayson, is also known as the AA Highway (officially, the ""John Y. Brown, Jr. AA Highway""). KY 10 forms a branch of the AA Highway between Vanceburg and the Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge in Grays Branch, near Greenup. Route description. High accident rate. The AA Highway is a rural two-lane highway for most of its length and traverses through some desolate terrain. Driver inattention and speeding, in combination with the numerous side road entrances and at-grade intersections have made it a dangerous and deadly road. To address these issues, guide signs comparable to interstate-styled signs have been installed along the highway at major intersections, along with additional overhead lighting. Other measures to improve safety and increase capacity are under consideration. History. The AA Highway was envisioned as a modern highway from Alexandria to Ashland. Construction began in 1985 on the first segment of the AA Highway. Estimated to cost $266 million to complete, it was designed primarily as a two-lane controlled-access facility. The first phase included the construction of of the AA Highway from the junction of Interstate 275 and KY 8 in Campbell County east to Vanceburg. The first phase also included the design of two twenty-five mile-long spurs running east from Vanceburg, one ending at US 23 near Lloyd and the Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge, the other ending near Interstate 64 in Grayson. When construction began, the costs for the first phase had risen to $292.7 million; the state had sold $300 million in bonds to pay for it. Segments of the highway, from Clarksburg just west of Vanceburg to Tollesboro was routed on an earlier relocated alignment of KY 10. It officially opened in 1995, however, it was not formally dedicated until 2003. Numbering quagmire. The AA Highway including the Greenup spur was originally designated as KY 546, and the Grayson spur was signed as KY 694. On May 26, 1988, the designation, ""AA Highway,"" was proposed to be signed along with KY 546 and KY 694. A few years later, this designation was put in place with the AA Highway being co-signed with KY 546 and KY 694, however, many motorists were soon confused by the ever changing designations. To solve this issue, the AA Highway was renumbered in late-1995. The AA Highway including the Grayson spur was renumbered KY 9, and the Greenup spur was renumbered as KY 10. KY 10 also overlaps portions of the AA Highway throughout the entire highway's existence. Old KY 9 in Campbell county was renumbered as KY 915, and old KY 10 between Vanceburg and South Portsmouth was redesignated as KY 8. Future. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is proposing widening and correcting some deficiencies and addressing growing traffic concerns along the AA Highway from its western terminus near Covington to Maysville. Several options are being considered, such as: removing some of the at-grade intersections, widening to four lanes from two with partial control access, and full control access. The AA Highway widening study was undertaken. Many residents and users of the road were concerned about intersection safety, while others discussed the high volume of traffic and the lack of passing lanes. Four alternatives were considered: Two median types were considered: a concrete barrier wall and a depressed grass median. Mountable medians in rural areas are not recommended. With each median type option, there would be travel lanes and shoulders. The depressed grass median would be 40 to , separating the two opposing traffic flows effectively. Due to the high speed of travel, access control with a minimum of is recommended for the limited access alternate. "
wikipedia-2309020," Act of Violence  Act of Violence is a 1948 film noir directed by Fred Zinnemann and adapted for the screen by Robert L. Richards from a story by Collier Young, featuring performances by Van Heflin, Robert Ryan, and Janet Leigh. Plot. Frank Enley (Van Heflin), returns home from World War II after surviving a German POW camp where the rest of his comrades had been murdered by guards during an escape attempt. The ""war hero"" is respected and praised for his fine character and good works in the California town of Santa Lisa, where he, his young wife and baby had settled after moving from the East. What he does not know is that Joe Parkson (Robert Ryan), once his best friend, also lived through the ordeal, though he was left with a crippled leg. In exchange for food, Frank had alerted the Nazi camp commander to their escape plans, thinking wrongly that the men would not be punished, and Joe is now determined finally to exact justice on Frank. Frank's young wife Edith (Janet Leigh) is completely in the dark about his transgressions, while Joe's girlfriend knows everything about her man, but cannot dissuade him from his passion to set past wrongs right by seeing Frank dead. Frank must confront his dark past and the truth that he is a coward, not a hero.  Doggedly pursued by Joe, who has traveled cross-country to stalk Frank's family repeatedly at their house, Frank goes into hiding, leaving his confused wife behind. While away at a trade convention in Los Angeles, Frank enlists the aid of a past-her-prime prostitute, Pat (Mary Astor), who introduces him to a shady lawyer and a hitman, Johnny (Berry Kroeger). Frank lures Joe into meeting him at night outside the lonely Santa Lisa train station, where the hitman plans to drive up and kill Joe, the gunshot muffled by the noise of the train. But things do not turn out as planned. Reception. Critical response. Roger Westcombe, writing for the Big House Film Society, considers the film unsettling, and wrote, """"Act of Violence""... with a profundity, through its unsettling moral continuum, redolent not of Hollywood simplicities of good/evil but of the art one associates with Zinnemann’s European background. This contains a clue. Fred and his brother escaped their native Austria in 1938, but their parents, waiting for U.S. visas that never came, perished – separately – in concentration camps. The ""survivor guilt"" this awful closing engendered must resemble the emotional see-saw ride which fiction like the ethical pendulum of ""Act of Violence"" can only start to expiate."" The staff at ""Variety"" magazine liked the film and gave it a positive review. They wrote, ""The grim melodrama implied by its title is fully displayed in ""Acts of Violence""...tellingly produced and played to develop tight excitement...The playing and direction catch plot aims and the characterizations are all topflight thesping. Heflin and Ryan deliver punchy performances that give substance to the menacing terror...It's grim business, unrelieved by lightness, and the players belt over their assignments under Zinnemann's knowing direction. Janet Leigh points up her role as Heflin's worried but courageous wife, while Phyllis Thaxter does well by a smaller part as Ryan's girl. A standout is the brassy, blowzy femme created by Mary Astor – a woman of the streets who gives Heflin shelter during his wild flight from fate."" The film was entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival. Currently, it holds a 100% ""Fresh"" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews. "
wikipedia-2309038," Formula Atlantic  Formula Atlantic is a specification of open wheel racing car developed in the 1970s. It was used in professional racing through the IMSA Atlantic Championship until 2009 and is currently primarily used in amateur racing through Sports Car Club of America Formula Atlantic. History. The history of Formula Atlantic begins with the SCCA Formula B class, created in 1965 for single-seat formula cars with engines not exceeding 1600cc in capacity. Prior to Formula Atlantic, professional Formula B races were held in the United States from 1965 to 1972, firstly with the SCCA's poorly-supported Formula A, then as part of the SCCA Formula Continental Championship in 1968 (when they were largely overshadowed by the V8-powered Formula 5000 cars) and then as an independent series from 1969 to 1972. Formula Atlantic as a class evolved in the United Kingdom in 1971 from the US Formula B rules, with 1600cc production-based twin-cam engines (initially Cosworth Mk.XIII based on Lotus-Ford Twin Cam and then Cosworth BDD, however other engines like Alfa Romeo were also eligible). Conceived by John Webb of Brands Hatch (who would later also develop the Sports 2000 class) as a category for national competitors with the performance near a Formula Two car but running costs at or below that of a contemporary Formula Three car. A single Yellow Pages championship ran in 1971-2, with a rival BP backed series appearing in 1973. 1974 saw the BP series changing sponsor to John Player, and the Yellow Pages series becoming backed by John Webb's MCD organisation and Southern Organs; in practice most top drivers competed in both series and there were no date clashes. Only one series ran in 1975-6, in the final year taking the title '""Indylantic"" and adopting Indianapolis-style single-car qualifying. But the formula was under threat from Formula 3 and no series ran in 1977-78. A BRSCC-organized club racing series returned in 1979 with initial backing from Hitachi and continued to 1983, with diminishing grids and few new cars appearing. As a result of its similarity to Formula 2 and Formula 3 in terms of chassis regulations, Formula Atlantic typically used chassis closely related to these cars—with performance somewhere in between the two—so most of the manufacturers were familiar from those classes, particularly the likes of Brabham, Lotus, March, Chevron early on, with Ralt and then Reynard later. US manufacturer Swift came to displace the British imports and dominate in North America. Several smaller marques also appeared. The first professional races run under Formula Atlantic rules in North America were conducted in 1974 by the CASC in Canada (now ASN Canada), drawing much attention and large fields due to its national CTV television coverage. IMSA in the United States took advantage of the large number of teams and organized their own series in 1976. During these years, the series attracted guest drivers from Europe, including Formula One, particularly at the Trois-Rivières street race in Quebec, Canada. Guest drivers included James Hunt, Jean-Pierre Jarier, Riccardo Patrese, Patrick Depailler, Jacques Laffite, Didier Pironi and Vittorio Brambilla. In 1977, the SCCA sanctioned the US events and in 1978 the CASC and SCCA series merged, and conducted the series jointly until 1983, when it ran as the ""Formula Mondial North American Cup"" and was won by Michael Andretti. The series could not sustain the success of earlier seasons and was cancelled for 1984. Formula Mondial was an international category introduced by the FIA in 1983 with the intention of replacing both Formula Atlantic and Formula Pacific, the latter being a variant of Formula Atlantic that had been introduced in a number of Pacific Basin countries in the late 1970s. Current SCCA series. SCCA Formula Atlantic cars are allowed wings and ground effects. They use either the Toyota 4AGE engine or the Cosworth BDD. Cars meeting Super Vee specifications were also allowed but are now rarely seen. Prior to 2006 these rules were also largely used in the professional series except that all cars had to run a Fuel Injected 4AGE. This meant that competitive amateur teams could also participate in professional races and that old pro series equipment could be raced at the amateur level. However, in 2006 the pro series introduced a spec chassis, the Swift Engineering 016.a and a new spec engine, the Mazda-Cosworth MZR. The result was that the cars used in the pro series were drastically different than the amateur cars. In 2009, to shore up small race fields, the pro series introduced a ""C2 class"" for amateur level cars, primarily the Swift 014.a, currently the dominant chassis amateur competition. However the C2 class saw few entries and was abandoned in the middle of the season. The minimum weight of a Toyota or BDD powered Atlantic car is 1230 lbs. (558 kg) with driver. The SCCA considers it its fastest club racing class. Prior to gaining its own class, the Formula SCCA car raced in Formula Atlantic, where it was uncompetitive. As of 2011, the Swift 016.a with Mazda power has been accepted into SCCA Formula Atlantic, albeit with an intake restriction limiting engine power. With the end of the IMSA and Champ Car sanctioned professional Atlantic Championship after the 2009 season, the promoters of the F2000 Championship Series promoted a new pro series in 2012 using SCCA rules and sanctioned by the SCCA. The series saw few entrants and folded after one season. Tribute. In 2012, the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion historic automobile racing event at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California had a tribute to Formula Atlantic as a part of its scheduled groups.

wikipedia-2309094," Puerto Iguazú  Puerto Iguazú is a frontier city in the province of Misiones, Argentina. With a population of 82,227 (), it is the fifth largest city in the Province, after Posadas, Oberá, Eldorado and San Vicente. The world-renowned Iguazu Falls are only away from the city, and as a result the city has developed its infrastructure around tourism. History. In 1542, Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was the first European to discover what is now called Iguazu Falls. He was drawn by the noise of the water, which can be heard at a distance of several kilometers. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the Guaraní Indians were the principal inhabitants of the area. Despite its early exploration, the area remained occupied only by the Guaraní until 1880. In 1881, the province of Corrientes, which at that time included what is now Misiones, sold 50 square leagues () at the current site of Puerto Iguazú near the falls. The land changed hands three times in the course of just two years, and ended up as the property of Gregorio Lezama. At that time Misiones separated from Corrientes. Lezama funded a scientific expedition to explore the territory, enlisting Carlos Bosetti and Jordan Hummel for that purpose. Those two explorers later organized the first tourist trip to the falls. In 1888 Lezama also sold the land, this time to Martín Errecaborde and Company. Climate. Puerto Iguazú has a Humid Subtropical climate (Cfa according to Köppen climate classification). Temperatures are warm in winter and hot in summer. There is no dry season and rainfall is abundant with every month receiving over 100 mm (3.9 inches) of rain and the wettest month, November, receiving over 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rain on average. Precipitation falls mostly during convective storms. Due to abundant rainfall, rainforests surrounds Puerto Iguazú. The hot season lasts for up to 6 months or more, with temperatures reaching between 30°C (86F) and 35°C (95F) on most days, and dropping to 18°C (64F) to 24°C (75F) at night. Thunderstorms with heavy rains bring relief when the heat becomes too intense. The cool season runs from late April to mid September, with daily highs reaching an average of 21°C (70F) and a low of 11°C (52F) in June. These averages are reached through an alternating weather pattern, with several days with northerly winds and temperatures of around 28°C (82F) or higher and warm nights over 15°C (59F) giving way, in a very sudden manner, to cool, rainy weather and temperatures between 10°C and 15°C (50F to 59F) for a few days, then to dry, sunny weather and colder nights (around 5°C, or 41F, and sometimes much lower) and pleasant days in the 15°C to 20°C (59F to 68F) range, and a gradual increase in temperatures as winds rotate to the north again. Frost is rare but does occur on some winters, and temperatures within a few degrees of freezing occur every winter. The record low is -4.9°C (23.1F), a surprisingly low value given the latitude, the vegetation and the low elevation of the area.  Temperatures above 40°C (104°F) have been recorded in the summer.  Economy. The economy is centered around tourism, given that the city's many hotels provide the principal source of jobs for its inhabitants. Many international hotels have been and are being constructed along the banks of the Iguazú River. Other of the city's tourist attractions include Three Frontiers, where the Argentine, Paraguayan and Brazilian borders meet. Puerto Iguazú is home to an active community of artisans, the La Aripuca resort, the Museum of Images of the Jungle (a collection of woodcarvings), the Mbororé Museum, the Luis Honorio Rolón Municipal Nature Park, the Güira Oga Center for Bird Rehabilitation, the Hotel Esturión, the Iguazú Grand Hotel and Casino, and south of Puerto Iguazú, the Sheraton Iguazú Resort & Spa. The nearby Wanda Mines also attract gemstone and geode collectors. Operating since the 1950s, the mines are the site of some of Argentina's best agate, amethyst, quartz and topaz lodes. Transport. The Tancredo Neves International Bridge links Puerto Iguazú with the Brazilian border town of Foz do Iguaçu, where the Argentine National Route 12 becomes the Brazilian BR-469. From the main bus station one can take taxis, or the municipal bus, one of whose routes run from the Three Frontiers to Iguazú National Park (""Parque Nacional de las Cataratas""). The city is served by its own international airport, Cataratas del Iguazú International Airport, as well as by Foz do Iguaçu International Airport on the Brazilian side of the border. Ecology. One of the last remnants of the Atlantic Forest remains in and around the Iguazu Falls. This is a subtropical forest with native bamboos and a rich diversity of birds including toucans and hummingbirds. Coatis are accustomed to begging for food from park visitors. Most of the streets of Puerto Iguazu are unmetalled, red dirt, with gutters on either side (canalitos) that have grassy banks in which eels and a variety of freshwater fish, including knifefish (gymnotus) and catfish, inhabit. The canals drain into the Paraná River. "
wikipedia-2309167," Kenmore Air  Kenmore Air Harbor, Inc., doing business as Kenmore Air, is an American airline with its headquarters on the grounds of Kenmore Air Harbor in Kenmore, Washington, USA, north of Seattle. It operates scheduled and charter seaplane and land plane service to destinations throughout western Washington and southwestern British Columbia, as well as seaplane ""flightseeing"" flights around Seattle. In addition to its corporate headquarters, seaplane maintenance facility and terminal in Kenmore, the airline has hub operations for seaplanes at its terminal on Seattle's Lake Union and for land planes at Seattle's Boeing Field/King County International Airport. It also operates a maintenance facility for its land plane fleet at Renton Municipal Airport/Clayton Scott Field in Renton, Washington, just south of Seattle. Kenmore Air's livery also appears in Microsoft Flight Simulator X on the Cessna 208 Caravan and de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver. History. The airline was established and started operations on March 21, 1946. It was founded by Robert Munro, Reginald Collins and Jack Mines and began operations with a single Aeronca Model K seaplane and a hangar at a location formerly occupied by a lumber mill on north Lake Washington. The airline is still at its original location. After a short term partnership Munro continued alone with the company until his death in October 2000. The company was originally named Mines Collins Munro but was changed to the current name Kenmore Air a few months later to reflect its ties to the town of Kenmore, Washington where its operations were located both then and now. After beginning operations with its Aeronca Model K, it purchased three more aircraft a few weeks later. Kenmore Air originally made its money by accessing remote and sometimes dangerous locations during its early years. In July 1946, pilot Jack Mines was killed while flying supplies to a search and rescue team in the nearby Cascade mountains; as a result, Collins and Munro became the two owners of Kenmore Air. Munro soon became the sole owner of Kenmore Air when Collins moved to California after accepting a job there. From the start, Kenmore Air's seaplane maintenance and restoration service was an important part of the company. In the late-1940s, Kenmore Air became a Republic Seabee dealer for the Northwest and this became a success for Kenmore Air. At one point, 40 Seabees were based at Kenmore Air Harbor, though Kenmore Air themselves owned just one of these amphibian aircraft. Kenmore became experts in maintenance and repair of the aircraft and developed several modifications to improve the aircraft's performance. Kenmore Air also became an official aircraft and parts dealer for Cessna by the end of the 1950s, further expanding its aircraft maintenance business. In the 1950s, Kenmore Air began its charter business by offering flights to fishing and hunting spots in the Pacific Northwest. Kenmore Air also leased an aircraft to the US government for survey flights in Alaska. This led to a series of contracts with the US Navy which continues today. In 1953, a Canadian mining company hired Kenmore to help fly in equipment and tools to build a mining camp on Leduc Glacier, fifty miles north of Ketchikan, Alaska. Kenmore Air used two Noorduyn Norseman and a Seabee to fly in equipment over a two-month period. The aircraft flew in several pieces of large equipment to the glacier, including diesel engines, railroad cars, and tractors. In the 1960s, Kenmore Air expanded its maintenance services to include the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver seaplane. They purchased their first Beaver in 1963 and the Beaver soon became a centerpiece of Kenmore Air's fleet, and they created a rebuilding and modification program around the seven-passenger aircraft. After the Beaver ceased production in 1967, Kenmore Air began to establish themselves as a leading refurbisher of the seaplane. They modified and rebuilt Beavers to such an extent that such aircraft modified by the company have become known as ""Kenmore Beavers"" by the global aviation community. Kenmore Air has rebuilt a total of 125 Beavers since then. To accommodate their expansion, the company built a new hangar and office building during the 1960s. In the early 1970s, in a contract with the US Navy, Kenmore Air transported unarmed torpedoes to a joint US-Canadian testing facility near Vancouver Island. For five years during this decade, Kenmore Air transported scientists and supplies to a glacier on Mount Olympus, in which the seaplanes had to takeoff and land on a glacier 6,500 feet above sea level. The airline also expanded its charter service in the 1970s, offering round-trip flights to fishing resorts in British Columbia. In the mid-1980s Kenmore Air purchased Otter Air, an airline that offered seaplane service from Seattle to Victoria, BC. The Seattle-Victoria route was operated for two years before it was sold to their competitor Lake Union Air in 1988. Kenmore Air also added two Turbo Beavers (a modified Beaver with its radial engine replaced with a turboprop engine) in the late 1980s, and purchased their main competitor Lake Union Air in 1992. With this purchase, Kenmore Air acquired a seaplane terminal on Lake Union. They converted one of Lake Union Air's de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters into a Turbo Otter and later purchased several more Turbo Otters. In 1997, Kenmore Air planned to begin operating service from Elliott Bay, a body of water on Puget Sound where Seattle's downtown waterfront is located. In 1998, Kenmore Air gained a federal permit allowing them to begin operations there, pending approval from Seattle's city council. The company later abandoned their plans in fall 1999 after encountering resistance from members of the local community. In October 2000, Robert Munro, the company's founder and owner, died at age 83 after an extended illness. Ownership was passed to Munro's son, Gregg Munro, while several other family members, also held management positions at Kenmore Air. Destinations. Daily, year-round seaplane service is provided from Seattle's Lake Union to Lopez Island, Orcas Island and San Juan Island in Washington State, as well as to Victoria, BC. Limited year-round service is also provided from Lake Union to the Canadian Gulf Islands and the Saanich Peninsula. Seasonally (May–September), daily seaplane service is provided from Kenmore Air Harbor to more than 30 destinations in British Columbia, including Big Bay, Campbell River, Cortes Island, Desolation Sound, Nanaimo, Port Hardy, Port McNeill, Quadra Island, the Sechelt Peninsula, Sonora Island, and Refuge Cove. Kenmore Air Express provides daily, year-round service to the Washington communities of Eastsound, Friday Harbor, and Port Angeles. "
wikipedia-2309323," Idiosyncrasy  An idiosyncrasy is an unusual feature of a person (though there are also other uses, see below). It also means odd habit. The term is often used to express eccentricity or peculiarity. A synonym may be ""quirk"". Etymology. The term ""idiosyncrasy"" originates from Greek """" [""idiosynkrasía""], ""a peculiar temperament"", ""habit of body"" (, [""idios""] ""one's own"", , [""syn""] ""with"" and [""krasis""] ""mixture""). Linguistics. The term can also be applied to symbols or words. ""Idiosyncratic symbols"" mean one thing for a particular person, as a blade could mean war, but to someone else, it could symbolize a surgery. By the same principle, linguists (such as Ferdinand de Saussure) state that words are not only arbitrary, but also largely idiosyncratic signs. Medicine. Disease. Idiosyncrasy defined the way physicians conceived diseases in the 19th century. They considered each disease as a unique condition, related to each patient. This understanding began to change in the 1870s, when discoveries made by researchers in Europe permitted the advent of a 'scientific medicine', a precursor to the Evidence-Based Medicine that is the standard of practice today. Pharmacology. In contemporary medicine (as of 2007), the term idiosyncratic drug reaction denotes a non-immunological hypersensitivity to a substance, without connection to pharmacological toxicity. ""Idiosyncratic"" stresses here the fact that other individuals would react differently, or not at all, and that the reaction is an individual one based on a specific condition of the one who suffers it. Most commonly, this is caused by an enzymopathy, congenital or acquired, so that the triggering substance cannot be processed properly in the organism and causes symptoms by accumulating or blocking other substances to be processed. An idiosyncrasy causing symptoms like an allergy is also called pseudoanaphylaxis. Psychiatry and psychology. In psychiatry, the term means a specific and unique mental condition of a patient, often accompanied by neologisms. In psychoanalysis and behaviorism, it is used for the personal way a given individual reacts, perceives and experiences a common situation: a certain dish made of meat may cause nostalgic memories in one person and disgust in another. These reactions are called idiosyncratic. Idiosyncrasy in economics. In portfolio theory, risks of price changes due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market, are called idiosyncratic risk. This risk can be virtually eliminated from a portfolio through diversification—holding multiple securities means the movements of individual securities ""cancel out"". It is also often called unsystematic or specific risk. In complete markets, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the capital asset pricing model holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of systematic risk in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a landlord from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.  In econometrics, idiosyncratic error is used to describe error from panel data that both changes over time and across units (individuals, firms, cities, etc.) "

wikipedia-2309328," Vincent Lingiari  Vincent Lingiari AM (1908 – 21 January 1988), was an Aboriginal rights activist. Lingiari was a member of the Gurindji people. In his earlier life he worked as a stockman at Wave Hill Cattle Station. He also played the didgeridoo. Vincent was elected and became the leader of the ""Gurindji"" communities in August 1966. On 7 June 1976, Lingiari was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the Aboriginal people. The story of Vincent Lingiari was celebrated in the song ""From Little Things Big Things Grow"". Wave Hill walk-off. Wave Hill Cattle Station is located approximately 600 km south of Darwin in the Northern Territory. From the late nineteenth century it was run by the ""British"" pastoral company, Vesteys. Vesteys employed the local Indigenous people, the ""Gurindji"", to work on Wave Hill. But working conditions were extremely poor and wages were very low when compared to those of non Indigenous employees. In 1966, Lingiari, a member of the ""Gurindji"" who had worked at Wave Hill, and recently returned from a period of hospitalisation in Darwin, led a walk-off of indigenous employees of Wave Hill as a protest against the work and conditions. While there had been complaints from Indigenous employees about conditions on Wave Hill over many years, including an inquiry during the 1930s that was critical of Vestey's employment practices, the walk-off had a focus that was aimed at a wider target than Vestey's. Before 1968 it was illegal to pay an indigenous worker more than a specified amount in goods and money. In many cases, the government benefits for which Indigenous employees were eligible were paid into pastoral companies’ accounts, rather than to the individuals. The protesters established the Wattie Creek Camp and demanded the return of some of their traditional lands. Speaking on this Lingiari said, ""We want to live on our land, our way"". So began the eight-year fight by the ""Gurindji"" people to obtain title to their land. Land Rights Act and handback. The Wave Hill strike would eventually reshape the agenda of relationships between indigenous Australians and the wider community. Although initially an employee-rights action, it soon became a major federal issue when the Gurindji people demanded the return of their traditional lands. The strike lasted 8 years. Over that time, support for Aboriginal rights grew as the struggle intensified. The protest eventually led to the ""Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976"". This act gave indigenous Australians freehold title to traditional lands in the Northern Territory and, significantly, the power to negotiate over mining and development on those lands, including what type of compensation they would like. An important and symbolic event in Australian history occurred when, during an emotional ceremony in 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam poured the local sand into Vincent Lingiari's hands, symbolically handing the Wave Hill station back to the Gurindji people. A photograph of the moment captured by Mervyn Bishop was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and is displayed in Old Parliament House. On 7 June 1976, Lingiari was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the Aboriginal people. Vincent's legacy. Vincent Lingiari died on 21 January 1988. Every year until then he attended the Gurindji’s annual re-enactment of the walk-off. Vincent Lingiari was a leader and holder of the cultural authority of the ""Gurindji"" people. His fight for his people’s rights – to the custodianship and ownership of their land and the capacity to practise their law, culture and language – made him a national figure. Vincent Lingiari confronted the vast economic and political forces that were arrayed against him and his people. In doing so, he won a victory that is one of the most outstanding achievements in the history of the struggle for the recognition of Indigenous people, their rights and responsibilities in the land, and their ability to practice their law, language and culture.One of Australia's largest electorates is named after Vincent. The Division of Lingiari encompasses nearly all of the Northern Territory as well as Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands. It includes Daguragu and traditional ""Gurindji"" lands. The story of Vincent Lingiari was celebrated in the song ""From Little Things Big Things Grow"" written by Paul Kelly and Indigenous musician Kev Carmody and recorded by Kelly in 1991. "
wikipedia-2309354," Jesús Malverde  Jesús Malverde, sometimes known as the ""generous bandit"", ""angel of the poor"", or the ""narco-saint"", is a folklore hero in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. He is celebrated as a folk saint by some in Mexico and the United States, particularly among those involved in drug trafficking. He is not recognized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. History. The existence of Malverde a.k.a. 'El Rey de Sinaloa' is not historically verified, but according to local legends he was a bandit killed by the authorities on May 3, 1909. Accounts of his life vary – sometimes he was a railway worker, while others claim he was a construction worker. There is also no agreement on the way he died, being hanged or shot. Since Malverde's supposed death, he has earned a Robin Hood-type image, making him popular among Sinaloa's poor highland residents. The outlaw image has caused him to be adopted as the ""patron saint"" of the region's illegal drug trade, and the press have thus dubbed him ""the narco-saint."" However, his intercession is also sought by those with troubles of various kinds, and a number of supposed miracles have been locally attributed to him, including personal healings and blessings. Malverde's legacy. A series of three Spanish-language films have been released under the titles ""Jesus Malverde,"" ""Jesus Malverde II: La Mafia de Sinaloa,"" and ""Jesus Malverde III: Infierno en Los Angeles.""

wikipedia-2309411," Tanjong Pagar United FC  Tanjong Pagar United Football Club is a professional football club in Singapore. The club took part in Singapore's S.League from 1996 to 2004. The club withdrew from the S.League after the 2004 season because of financial problems but returned to the S.League in 2011. Prior to the formation of the S.League, the team was known as Tiong Bahru Constituency Sports Club, and won Singapore's National Football League in 1983 and 1987. The club changed its name to Tiong Bahru United Football Club in 1996, and then to Tanjong Pagar United in 1998. The team's mascot is a Jaguar. During its first run in the S.League, the club's home ground was the Queenstown Stadium. However, as the Queenstown Stadium was occupied since 2010 by French club Etoile FC, Tanjong Pagar United was based in Clementi Stadium for the duration of the 2011 season. However, due to Etoile FC's withdrawal from the S-League by the end of the 2011 season, Tanjong Pagar shifted back to Queenstown Stadium for the 2012 season. The club were formed as Tiong Bahru Constituency Sports Club in 1975 and debuted in Division III of the National Football League, from which they were promoted as champions in 1978. This was followed by a second successive promotion in 1979, bringing the Jaguars to Division I. In 1982, they won the President's Cup and the following year, they were national league champions. They represented Singapore in the 1984 ASEAN Club Games, finishing third, then captured The Double in 1987. The early 1990s saw further successes, as they were Pools Cup winners in 1991 and 1993, finished runners-up in the FAS Premier League from 1991 to 1993 and bagged the FA Cup in 1994. Their strong performances led to their selection as one of eight clubs to compete in the newly-formed S.League, so in 1995, they were renamed to Tiong Bahru Football Club and obtained a permanent home at the Queenstown Stadium.

wikipedia-2309427," Magnetosphere of Saturn  The magnetosphere of Saturn is the cavity created in the flow of the solar wind by the planet's internally generated magnetic field. Discovered in 1979 by the ""Pioneer 11"" spacecraft, Saturn's magnetosphere is the second largest of any planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. The magnetopause, the boundary between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind, is located at a distance of about 20 Saturn radii from the planet's center, while its magnetotail stretches hundreds of radii behind it.  Saturn's magnetosphere is filled with plasmas originating from both the planet and its moons. The main source is the small moon Enceladus, which ejects as much as 1,000 kg/s of water vapor from the geysers on its south pole, a portion of which is ionized and forced to co-rotate with the Saturn’s magnetic field. This loads the field with as much as 100 kg of water group ions per second. This plasma gradually moves out from the inner magnetosphere via the interchange instability mechanism and then escapes through the magnetotail. The interaction between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind generates bright oval aurorae around the planet's poles observed in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. The aurorae are related to the powerful saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which spans the frequency interval between 100 kHz to 1300 kHz and was once thought to modulate with a period equal to the planet's rotation. However, later measurements showed that the periodicity of the SKR's modulation varies by as much as 1%, and so probably does not exactly coincide with Saturn’s true rotational period, which as of 2010 remains unknown. Inside the magnetosphere there are radiation belts, which house particles with energy as high as tens of Megaelectronvolts. The energetic particles have significant influence on the surfaces of inner icy moons of Saturn. In 1980–1981 the magnetosphere of Saturn was studied by the Voyager spacecraft. As of 2010 it is a subject of the ongoing investigation by Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004. Discovery. Immediately after the discovery of Jupiter's decametric radio emissions in 1955, attempts were made to detect a similar emission from Saturn, but with inconclusive results. The first evidence that Saturn might have an internally generated magnetic field came in 1974, with the detection of weak radio emissions from the planet at the frequency of about 1 MHz. These medium wave emissions were modulated with a period of about , which was close to Saturn's rotation period. Nevertheless, the evidence available in the 1970s was too inconclusive and some scientists thought that Saturn might lack a magnetic field altogether, while others even speculated that the planet could lie beyond the heliopause. The first definite detection of the saturnian magnetic field was made only on September 1, 1979, when it was passed through by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which measured its magnetic field strength directly. Structure. Internal field. Like Jupiter's magnetic field, Saturn's is created by a fluid dynamo within a layer of circulating liquid metallic hydrogen in its outer core. Like Earth's, Saturn's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis. On Saturn, like on Jupiter, the north magnetic pole is located in the northern hemisphere, and the south magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere, which is the opposite to the Earth, where the north magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere. Saturn's magnetic field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, thought they are much weaker than the dipole. The magnetic field strength at Saturn's equator is about 21 μT (0.21 G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 4.6 T•m3. This makes Saturn's magnetic field slightly weaker than Earth's; however, its magnetic moment is about 580 times larger. Saturn's magnetic dipole is strictly aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly axisymmetric. The dipole is slightly shifted (by 0.037 Rs) along Saturn's rotational axis towards the north pole. Size and shape. Saturn's internal magnetic field deflects the solar wind, a stream of ionized particles emitted by the Sun, away from its surface, preventing it from interacting directly with its atmosphere and instead creating its own region, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma very different from that of the solar wind. The magnetosphere of Saturn is the second–largest magnetosphere in the Solar System after that of Jupiter. As with Earth's magnetosphere, the boundary separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere is called the magnetopause. The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27 Rs (Rs=60,330 km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magetopause standoff distance is about 22 Rs. In front of the magnetopause (at the distance of about 27 Rs from the planet) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath. At the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Saturn's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which consists of two lobes, with the magnetic field in the northern lobe pointing away from Saturn and the southern pointing towards it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet. Like Earth’s, Saturn's tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere. Similar to Jupiter, the tail is the conduit through which the plasma of the internal magnitospheric origin leaves the magnetosphere. The plasma moving from the tail to the inner magnitopshere is heated and forms a number of radiation belts. Magnetospheric regions. Saturn's magnetosphere is often divided into four regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3 Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just inside and outside the rings. The second region between 3 and 6 Rs contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. The third region lies between 6 and 12–14 Rs and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15 Rs at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind. In the outer parts of Saturn's magnetosphere beyond approximately 15–20 Rs the magnetic field near the equatorial plane is highly stretched and forms a disk-like structure called ""magnetodisk"". The disk continues up to the magnetopause on the dayside and transitions into the magnetotail on the nightside. Near the dayside it can be absent when the magnetosphere is compressed by the Solar wind, which usually happens when the magnetopause distance is smaller than 23 Rs. On the nightside and flanks of the magnetosphere the magnetodisk is always present. The Saturn's magnetodisk is a much smaller analog of the Jovian magnetodisk. The plasma sheet in the Saturn's magnetosphere has a bowl-like shape not found in any other known magnetosphere. When Cassini arrived in 2004, there was a winter in the northern hemisphere. The measurements of the magnetic field and plasma density revealed that the plasma sheet was warped and lay to the north of the equatorial plane looking like a giant bowl. Such a shape was unexpected. Dynamics. The processes driving Saturn's magnetosphere are similar to those driving Earth's and Jupiter's. Just as Jupiter's magnetosphere is dominated by plasma co–rotation and mass–loading from Io, so Saturn's magnetosphere is dominated by plasma co–rotation and mass–loading from Enceladus. However, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller in size, while its inner region contains too little plasma to seriously distend it and create a large magnetodisk. This means that it is much more strongly influenced by the solar wind, and that, like Earth's magnetic field, its dynamics are affected by reconnection with the wind similar to the Dungey cycle. Another distinguishing feature of the Saturn's magnetosphere is high abundance of neutral gas around the planet. As revealed by ultraviolet observation of Cassini, the planet is enshrouded in a large cloud of hydrogen, water vapor and their dissociative products like hydroxyl, extending as far as 45 Rs from Saturn. In the inner magnetosphere the ratio of neutrals to ions is around 60 and it increases in the outer magnetosphere, which means that the entire magnetospheric volume is filled with relatively dense weakly ionized gas. This is different, for instance, from Jupiter or Earth, where ions dominate over neutral gas, and has consequences for the magnetospheric dynamics. Sources and transport of plasma. The plasma composition in Saturn's inner magnetosphere is dominated by the water group ions: O+, H2O+, OH+ and others, hydronium ion (H3O+), HO2+ and O2+, although protons and nitrogen ions (N+) are also present. The main source of water is Enceladus, which releases 300–600 kg/s of water vapor from the geysers near its south pole. The released water and hydroxyl (OH) radicals (a product of water's dissociation) form a rather thick torus around the moon's orbit at 4 Rs with densities up to 10,000 molecules per cubic centimeter. At least 100 kg/s of this water is eventually ionized and added to the co–rotating magnetospheric plasma. Additional sources of water group ions are Saturn's rings and other icy moons. The Cassini spacecraft also observed small amounts of N+ ions in the inner magnetosphere, which probably originate from Enceladus as well. In the outer parts of the magnetosphere the dominant ions are protons, which originate either from the Solar wind of Saturn's ionosphere. Titan, which orbits close to the magnetopause boundary at 20 Rs, is not a significant source of plasma. The relatively cold plasma in the innermost region of Saturn's magnetosphere, inside 3 Rs (near the rings) consists mainly of O+ and O2+ ions. There ions together with electrons form an ionosphere surrounding the saturnian rings. For both Jupiter and Saturn, transport of plasma from the inner to the outer parts of the magnetosphere is thought to be related to interchange instability. In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, water–rich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with hot plasma arriving from the outer magnetosphere. The instability is driven by centrifugal force exerted by the plasma on the magnetic field. The cold plasma is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail. The plasmoids move down the tail and escape from the magnetosphere. The reconnection or substorm process is though to be under the control of the solar wind and Saturn's largest moon Titan, which orbits near the outer boundary of the magnetosphere. In the magnetodisk region, beyond 6 Rs, the plasma within the co–rotating sheet exerts a significant centrifugal force on the magnetic field, causing it to stretch. This interaction creates a current in the equatorial plane flowing azimuthally with rotation and extending as far as 20 Rs from the planet. The total strength of this current varies from 8 to 17 MA. The ring current in the saturnian magnetosphere is highly variable and depends of the solar wind pressure, being stronger when the pressure is weaker. The magnetic moment associated with this current slightly (by about 10 nT) depresses the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, although it increases the total magnetic moment of the planet and causing the size of the magnetosphere to become larger. Aurorae. Saturn has bright polar aurorae, which have been observed in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared light. The aurorae usually look like bright continuous circles (ovals) surrounding the poles of the planet. The latitude of auroral ovals varies in the range of 70–80°; the average position is for the southern aurora, while the northern aurora is closer to the pole by about 1.5°. From time to time either aurorae can assume a spiral shape instead of oval. In this case it begins near midnight at a latitude of around 80°, then its latitude decreases to as low as 70° as it continues into the dawn and day sectors (counterclockwise). In the dusk sector the auroral latitude increases again, although when it returns to the night sector it still has a relatively low latitude and does not connect to the brighter dawn part. Unlike Jupiter's, the Saturn's main auroral ovals are not related to the breakdown of the co–rotation of the plasma in the outer parts of the planet's magnetosphere. The aurorae on Saturn are thought to be connected to the reconnection of the magnetic field under the influence of the Solar wind (Dungey cycle), which drives an upward current (about 10 million amperes) from the ionosphere and leads to the acceleration and precipitation of energetic (1–10 kev) electrons into the polar thermosphere of Saturn. The saturnian aurorae are more similar to those of the Earth, where they are also Solar wind driven. The ovals themselves correspond to the boundaries between open and closed magnetic field lines—so called polar caps, which are thought to reside at the distance of 10–15° from the poles.  The aurorae of Saturn are highly variable. Their location and brightness strongly depends on the Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright auroral features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50 GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170 nm) and 150–300 GW in the near-infrared (3–4 μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum. Saturn kilometric radiation. Saturn is the source of rather strong low frequency radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300 kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400 kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotyron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200 Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like in the case of the Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1 GW. The modulation of the radio emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally used to determine the rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30 days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it all but impossible to determine the true rotational period of Saturn. Radiation belts. Saturn has relatively weak radiation belts, because energetic particles are absorbed by the moons and particulate material orbiting the planet. The densest (main) radiation belt lies between the inner edge of the Enceladus gas torus at 3.5 Rs and the outer edge of the A Ring at 2.3 Rs. It contains protons and relativistic electrons with energies from hundreds kiloelectronvolts (keV) to as high as tens Megaelectronvolts (MeV) and possibly other ions. Beyond 3.5 Rs the energetic particles are absorbed by the neutral gas and their numbers drop, although less energetic particles with energies in the range of hundreds keV appear again beyond 6 Rs—these are the same particles that contribute to the ring current. The electrons in the main belt probably originate in the outer magnetosphere or Solar wind, from which they are transported by the diffusion and then adiabatically heated. However, the energetic protons consist of two populations of particles. The first population with energies of less than about 10 MeV has the same origin as electrons, while the second one with the maximum flux near 20 MeV results from the interaction of cosmic rays with solid material present in the saturnian system (so called cosmic ray albedo neutron decay process—CRAND). The main radiation belt of Saturn is strongly influenced by interplanetary Solar wind distubances. The innermost region of the magnetosphere near the rings is generally devoid of energetic ions and electrons because they are absorbed by ring particles. Saturn, however, has the second radiation belt discovered by Cassini in 2004 and located just inside the innermost D Ring. This belt probably consists of energetic charged particles formed via the CRAND process or of ionized energetic neutral atoms coming from the main radiation belt. The saturnian radiation belts are generally much weaker that those of Jupiter and do not emit much microwave radiation (with frequency of a few Gigahertz). Estimates shows that their decimetric radio emissions (DIM) would be impossible to detect from the Earth. Nevertherless the high energy particles cause weathering of the surfaces of the icy moons and sputter water, water products and oxygen from them. Interaction with rings and moons. The abundant population of solid bodies orbiting Saturn including moons as well as ring particles exerts a strong influence on the magnetosphere of Saturn. The plasma in the magnetosphere co-rotates with the planet, continuously impinging on the trailing hemispheres of slowly moving moons. While ring particles and the majority of moons only passively absorb plasma and energetic charged particles, three moons – Enceladus, Dione and Titan – are significant sources of new plasma. The absorption of energetic electrons and ions reveals itself by noticeable gaps in the radiation belts of Saturn near the moon's orbits, while the dense rings of Saturn completely eliminate all energetic electrons and ions closer than 2.2 RS, creating a low radiation zone in the vicinity of the planet. The absorption of the co-rotating plasma by a moon disturbs the magnetic field in its empty wake—the field is pulled towards a moon, creating a region of a stronger magnetic field in the near wake. The three moons mentioned above add new plasma into the magnetosphere. By far the strongest source is Enceladus, which ejects a fountain of water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen through cracks in its south pole region. A fraction of this gas is ionized by the hot electrons and solar ultraviolet radiation and is added to the co-rotational plasma flow. Titan once was thought to be the principal source of plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere, especially of nitrogen. The new data obtained by Cassini in 2004–2008 established that it is not a significant source of nitrogen after all, although it may still provide significant amounts of hydrogen (due to dissociation of methane). Dione is the third moon producing more new plasma than it absorbs. The mass of plasma created in the vicinity of it (about 6 g/s) is about 1/300 as much as near Enceladus. However, even this low value can not be explained only by sputtering of its icy surface by energetic particles, which may indicate that Dione is endogenically active like Enceladus. The moons that create new plasma slow the motion of the co-rotating plasma in their vicinity, which leads to the pile-up of the magnetic field lines in front of them and weakening of the field in their wakes—the field drapes around them. This is the opposite to what is observed for the plasma-absorbing moons. The plasma and energetic particles present in the magnetosphere of Saturn, when absorbed by ring particles and moons, cause radiolysis of the water ice. Its products include ozone, hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The first one has been detected in the surfaces of Rhea and Dione, while the second is thought to be responsible for the steep spectral slopes of moons' reflectivities in the ultraviolet region. The oxygen produced by radiolysis forms tenuous atmospheres around rings and icy moons. The ring atmosphere was detected by Cassini for the first time in 2004. A fraction of the oxygen gets ionized, creating a small population of O2+ ions in the magnetosphere. The influence of Saturn's magnetosphere on its moons is more subtle than the influence of Jupiter on its moons. In the latter case, the magnetosphere contains a significant number of sulfur ions, which, when implanted in surfaces, produce characteristic spectral signatures. In the case of Saturn, the radiation levels are much lower and the plasma is composed mainly of water products, which, when implanted, are indistinguishable from the ice already present. Exploration. As of 2009 the magnetosphere of Saturn has been directly explored by four spacecraft. The first mission to study the magnetosphere was Pioneer 11 in September 1979. Pioneer 11 discovered the magnetic field and made some measurements of the plasma parameters. In November 1980 and August 1981, Voyager 1–2 probes investigated the magnetosphere using an improved set of instruments. From the fly-by trajectories they measured the planetary magnetic field, plasma composition and density, high energy particle energy and spatial distribution, plasma waves and radio emissions. Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997, and arrived in 2004, making the first measurements in more than two decades. The spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around Saturn, continues to provide information about the magnetic field and plasma parameters of the saturnian magnetosphere. In the 1990s, the Ulysses spacecraft conducted extensive measurements of the saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which is unobservable from Earth due to the absorption in the ionosphere. The SKR is powerful enough to be detected from a spacecraft at the distance of several astronomical units from the planet. Ulysses discovered that the period of SKR varies by as much as 1%, and therefore is not directly related to the rotation period of the interior of Saturn. "
wikipedia-2309460," Montana Freemen  The Montana Freemen were a Christian Patriot movement based outside the town of Jordan, Montana. The members of the group referred to their land as ""Justus Township"" and had declared themselves no longer under the authority of any outside government. They became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Philosophy. The Montana Freemen espoused belief in the doctrine of individual sovereignty and rejected the authority of the federal government of the United States. They conceived their own system of government in ""Justus Township"", including their own versions of common-law court de jure, banking, and credit. Liens. Leader LeRoy M. Schweitzer Standoff. In late 1994 foreclosure proceedings were initiated against the farm that contained Justus Township. The Freemen refused to be evicted from the land. They had also conducted their own mock trials of numerous public officials, and issued their own writ of execution against a federal judge. The FBI investigated the group and initiated a sting operation aimed at one of the Freemen's financial programs, which led to the arrest of two members of the group in March 1996. The FBI also had warrants for eight other persons suspected to be in the farm, but before they were able to arrest them an armed confrontation developed and the FBI withdrew to a safe distance to avoid violence. The similar standoff in Waco, Texas involving the Branch Davidians as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent and tragic events. After 81 days of negotiations, the Freemen surrendered to authorities on June 14, 1996.  Aftermath. Statutes were subsequently changed in Montana, and eventually elsewhere, to require that any notices of liens filed had to have a current corporate county judge or clerk signature to be held valid as ""commercial paper"" which can be sold or traded. LeRoy Schweitzer was convicted of conspiracy, bank fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, false claims to the IRS, interstate transportation of stolen property, threats against public officials, armed robbery of a television news crew, and firearms violations. He received a 22 year sentence for 25 convictions in a South Carolina federal prison, but was moved to the Administrative Maximum (ADX) facility at the Florence Federal Correctional Complex at Florence, Colorado, in 2006 after Ervin Elbert Hurlbert and Donald Little, who identified themselves as ""Montana Marshals"", attempted to free Schweitzer from the prison. He died in the ADX on September 20, 2011. Members have contended in various shortwave and talk radio interviews that several of the liens were sold into the offshore banking market. Some members and members of their families have claimed that the US Government's tactics were used to coerce Schweitzer and others to release the liens on public officials. Scott Roeder, convicted on January 22, 2010, for the murder of Dr. George Tiller, was reportedly involved with the Freemen. Members of the Montana Freemen and their sentences. On 7 April 2008, Russell Dean Landers had his 11-year, 3-month sentence extended by 15 years for attempting to extort his release from prison. He and two other inmates at the federal prison in El Reno, Oklahoma had demanded millions of dollars from officials for the use of their names, which they claimed were ""copyrighted."" They were found guilty of ""conspiring to impede the duties of federal prison officials and extortion in (their) efforts to gain release from prison by making financial demands on prison staff and attempting to seize their property.""  On 6 April 2010, Daniel E. Peterson was sentenced to additional time for filing bogus liens from prison against three federal judges. One of the judges targeted was the judge who sentenced Peterson to prison originally. Petersen was sentenced in 1996 to 15 years. He was convicted on 19 of 20 counts, which included bank fraud and armed robbery. While serving his sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota, Petersen devised a scheme in which to retaliate against three judges in his case. Federal prosecutors, after investigating, found that Petersen invented a company that supposedly held assets that included a $100 trillion default judgment against the United States. He then sold “shares"" of the phony company to fellow inmates and others. He claimed these shares were backed by “redemption certificates"" to be redeemed when the judgment was collected. The judgment he referred to came from a self-created court, after former Secretary of State Madeline Albright declined to respond to his demands. He was demanding $100 trillion, as well as $1 billion per day in interest for unlawfully confining him. Petersen followed up by filing liens against property owned by the three federal judges, as well as offering bounties for the arrest of the same judges. The purpose was to entice someone to bring the three judges to Minnesota, in order to respond to his liens. A 2011 National Public Radio report claimed that some of the people associated with this case were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit. "

wikipedia-2309492," A Period of Transition  A Period of Transition is the ninth studio album by Northern Irish singer/songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1977 (see 1977 in music). It was his first album in two and a half years, largely forgotten or looked over by most casual fans. At the time of its release it was received with some disappointment by critics and fans: ""Most were hoping for a work of primeval vocal aggression that would challenge the emerging élite of Morrison pretenders, whose ranks included Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, Phil Lynott, Graham Parker and Elvis Costello.""(Johnny Rogan) However, the album is still notable for several major compositions, including ""Heavy Connection,"" ""Flamingos Fly,"" ""The Eternal Kansas City"" and ""Cold Wind in August"". Morrison had appeared in ""The Last Waltz"" with Mac Rebennack (Dr. John) who was a co-producer on this album as well as playing keyboards and guitar. Recording. Clinton Heylin remarks on ""Flamingos Fly"" and ""Joyous Sound"": ""Just seven songs were recorded ""A Period of Transition"" and two of these had already been cut at the Record Plant back in 1975."" Both of these versions were included on the 1998 compilation album, ""The Philosopher's Stone"". ""Flamingos Fly"" was also recorded in 1973 with Jackie DeShannon and appeared on her album ""Jackie... Plus"", along with three other original Morrison compositions from that recording session. It didn't take Morrison long to play the song in concert — a week after the recording session on 18 April 1973, the song featured in a concert in Los Angeles at the Shrine Auditorium. This performance remains the only known live version of the song. Composition. ""You Gotta Make It Through the World"" is according to Morrison, ""a survival song"". Dr. John felt that it had ""a real spiritual sound"". ""It Fills You Up"" is an attempt by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music. ""The Eternal Kansas City"" is according to Dr. John ""the song that Van got the whole album hooked up around. It was a real deep thing for him to focus on. It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R & B."" The song, ""Joyous Sound"" is described by Brian Hinton as ""more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves."" Morrison said of the track, ""Flamingos Fly"", ""I've done three versions in the studio. I've done it slow, a ballad version. I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. This is the version I like best for release."" ""Heavy Connection"" is said to be ""psychic stuff"" with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking of a love connection ""when you came into my dreams/like from a whisper to a scream."" The last song on the album is ""Cold Wind in August"". Dr. John describes it as a ""cross current from forties to seventies music. It's like where Ray Charles left off. It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music."" ""Flamingos Fly"" was covered by Sammy Hagar, a year before ""A Period of Transition"" was released, on his first solo album ""Nine on a Ten Scale"". Reception. Greil Marcus, reviewing the album in ""Rolling Stone"" upon its release, offered a mostly negative appraisal: ""Morrison made better music in '64 and '65 with Them, the first (and last?) great Irish rock & roll band;...There is a lot of neo-R&B huffing and puffing on ""A Period of Transition"" (from what to what?), but Morrison's performances rarely find a focus, almost never hit a groove...The key to the album's sluggishness is the dullness of the horn charts."" The Allmusic reviewer, Stephen Thomas Erlewine says the album is ""warm, welcoming, infused with spirituality and humor. Still like any period of transition, this is somewhat tentative and uneven, with its best moments, being at best, minor masterpieces."" Adrian Denning called it ""a good little album"" with ""some earthy Van soul music on display"". Peter Knobler, reviewing the album in ""Crawdaddy"", wrote: ""People had started talking about Van Morrison in the past tense. In the three years since his last album release, ""Veedon Fleece"", his presence had grown to become some vaguely attainable level of excellence it seemed no one, not even Morrison himself, could ever truly achieve...""A Period of Transition"" is Van Morrison's comeback album and with it he steps from influential absentia directly back to the top."" Robert Christgau said in his review: ""in general this is an unexciting record—but not definitively. It's full of the surprising touches...that signify talent putting out.""  Biographer Steve Turner calls the album, ""lethargic and uninspired"" but says that perhaps it was the album Morrison needed to make after being largely absent from the music business for almost three years. (His only public performance during this time period was a highly acclaimed appearance on ""The Last Waltz"" with The Band in 1976.) Scott Floman was unimpressed calling it ""the first truly skippable album of Van’s career thus far."" Aftermath. Expectations were high and Morrison has admitted to working at his best when not under the pressure of high expectations from the industry and fans. In June 1977, he explained his feelings about this: The album charted moderately well but most critics were disappointed, after waiting three years for a new album from Morrison. He had hired Harvey Goldsmith as manager and began a much more public media profile after the album's release. He recorded a Midnight Special session for NBC that was broadcast in April 1977, appearing with Carlos Santana, George Benson and Etta James. Morrison also began giving interviews again, commencing with his first interview since 1973 to Cameron Crowe from ""Rolling Stone"". In the interview when asked by Crowe: ""Is the album a document of the actual period? Is the transition over?"" Morrison replies: ""All of that. It's been going on for about three years ...it's like, there's been lots of highs and there's been depressions... there's been starts and stops...it's just a period, you know."" Album cover. Morrison has said that the title of the album referred to its front cover. Photographer Ken Mcgowan captured Morrison in various reflective, introspective moods until he realises with a half smile in the last shot that all such moods are transitory. Track listing.

wikipedia-2309542," The Burning Wheel  The Burning Wheel is a fantasy role-playing game independently written and published by Luke Crane. The game uses a dice pool mechanic (using only standard six-sided dice) for task resolution and a character generation system that tracks the history and experiences of new characters from birth to the point they begin adventuring. ""The Burning Wheel"" does not include a dedicated setting. The rules, mechanics and backstory elements used in character generation imply a fantasy world by default, but can be easily modified, and the game includes mechanics for players to generate their own setting content during play, in the form of Wises and Circles tests. The core game includes two volumes: ""The Burning Wheel"", containing rules and mechanics, and the ""Character Burner"", with additional rules and biographic elements for generating Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs as characters, providing each with unique exceptions or additions to the overall game mechanics. Humans have access to Sorcery and miraculous Faith, Elves have a Grief statistic and spell-songs, Dwarves have Greed, and Orcs have blasphemous Hatred. The ""Monster Burner"" supplement includes premade monsters as well as mechanics and backstories for designing and building custom monsters, allowing the game to cover a much broader range of adventure and setting. This volume also contains four new and complete races for ""Burning Wheel"": Great Wolves, Roden (anthropomorphic rats), Great Spiders, and Trolls. The ""Magic Burner"" supplement was released in August 2008. It expands the limited rules found in the main rule book by describing a variety of potential metaphysical sources of magic, with associated rules on how those affect what spells can do and how they are cast. The book also contains additional traits and skills useful for magic-wielding characters and a system for creating custom spells. The ""Adventure Burner"" supplement was released in July 2010. It includes three ready-to-play scenarios, a host of pregenerated character templates for all officially supported races, and an extensive Commentary section that provides advice about how best to play the game and use the system for fun and challenge. The game has had three dedicated settings: January 2004: ""Under a Serpent Sun"", described as ""suicidal despair in a post-apocalyptic wasteland"". August 2005: ""Burning Sands: Jihad"", a science fiction expansion of galaxy-spanning religious war. A blog associated with the creators of ""Burning Wheel"" describes this expansion as being based on the ""Dune"" series. August 2007: ""The Blossoms are Falling"", based in Heian-era Japan. ""You play fearsome bushi trapped between honor and shame, wise Shinto priests who seek to placate the spirits who protect Nihon, powerful Buddhist monks who pray for the souls of the dead while plying strong influence at court, and powerful courtiers battling for control of the failing state."" Game Mechanics and Philosophy. Burning Wheel play revolves around the players generating a detailed background history for their characters, along with core motivations and ethics (Beliefs and Instincts) that connect them to the storyline and to the other PCs. Story is intended to develop organically rather than being pre-scripted, as a number of the game mechanics (e.g, pre-negotiated roll or scene outcomes, the 'Let it Ride' rule, absence of hidden information) exist to prevent GM railroading and help promote co-operation and trust between the players. (This is quite distinct from agreement among the PCs, who may argue and even fight within the context of the rules.) The GM is encouraged to create problems and challenges that specifically probe and test the Beliefs and Instincts of the PCs, and as a consequence characters frequently undergo significant change in their goals and attitudes over time. The game also includes a variety of quite complex, but technically optional, sub-systems for dealing with combat, chases, negotiation and spellcasting. Editions. The original rules (now referred to as ""Burning Wheel Classic"") were published 1 November 2002. A second edition, incorporating significant rules and text changes and generally referred to as ""Burning Wheel Revised"", was published 5 May 2005. A single-volume 600-page hardcover third edition, ""Burning Wheel Gold"", combined the contents of ""Burning Wheel Revised"" and ""Character Burner"" and was published 11 August 2011. In every case, the actual name of the game, as displayed on the cover art, is simply ""The Burning Wheel"". The three editions share many underlying concepts, but their rules are not entirely compatible. PDF Editions. No complete PDF Core rules set is released of the Revised or Gold editions. Extracts of sample chapters have been made available for download, both as teasers and as pay extracts of the lifepaths. Burning Wheel Classic was once available for purchase in PDF form but was withdrawn after selling a mere 10 copies and being widely distributed illegally. Teaser chapters of various supplements have been released as well, as with the Adventure Burner, and some setting products have full PDF versions. Related Games. Luke Crane also wrote ""Burning Empires"", a science fiction RPG based on the ""Iron Empires"" graphic novels by Christopher Moeller. ""Burning Empires"" shares many mechanics with ""Burning Wheel"", and was released at Gen Con 2006. Luke has penned another full game, entitled ""Mouse Guard"", which uses a simplified version of the ""Burning Wheel"" system and is set in the world of the Mouse Guard comics. It won Best Role-Playing Game at the 2009 Origins Awards. "
wikipedia-2309573," Caribbean Spanish  Caribbean Spanish (Spanish: ""español caribeño"") is the general name of the Spanish dialects spoken in the Caribbean region. It closely resembles the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands and Andalusia. More precisely, the term refers to the Spanish language as spoken in the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico,and the Dominican Republic; too in Panama, Venezuela and only in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Characteristics. Frequently, word-final and are dropped (as in ""compás"" 'beat', ""mitad"" 'half'). Syllable-final (as well as in any context) may also be debuccalized to . Similarly, syllable-final nasals and in the infinitival morpheme may also be dropped (e.g. ""ven"" 'come', ""comer"" 'to eat'); the dropping of final nasals doesn't result in further neutralization compared to other dialects since the nasalization of the vowel is maintained. Several neutralizations also occur in the syllable coda. The liquids and may neutralize to (e.g. Cibaeño Dominican ""celda""/""cerda"" 'cell'/'bristle'), (e.g. ""alma""/""arma"" 'soul'/'weapon'), or as complete regressive assimilation (e.g. ""pulga""/""purga"" 'flea'/'purge'). These deletions and neutralizations show variability in their occurrence, even with the same speaker in the same utterance, implying that nondeleted forms exist in the underlying structure. This is not to say that these dialects are on the path to eliminating coda consonants, since these processes have existed for more than four centuries in these dialects. argues that this is the result of speakers acquiring multiple phonological systems with uneven control similar to that of second language learners.

wikipedia-2309612," Paranormal television  Paranormal television is a genre of popular reality television programming. Its scope comprises purportedly factual investigations of paranormal phenomena, rather than fictional representations found in such shows as ""The Ghosts of Motley Hall"" and ""Ghostbusters"", or cartoon/children's series such as ""Scooby-Doo"" and ""Rentaghost"". History. Accounts of supernatural occurrences have always been common in the print media. The 1705 pamphlet ""A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs Veal"" by Daniel Defoe is a well-known example. Local TV news programs in the UK and USA have featured ghost stories since the 1960s. Paranormal television arose from this tradition. One of the earliest paranormal TV shows was ""In Search Of..."", hosted by Leonard Nimoy which ran for six years from 1976. Rod Serling was originally slated to host the series, but he died in 1975. ""In Search Of..."" explored many paranormal topics, including UFOs, cryptozoological creatures (cryptids), lost civilizations, and other mysteries. Though the subject matter gradually lost popularity, the show gave way to future TV series following the same genre. ""Ghostwatch"", a fictional news broadcast about a haunted house in the UK that aired in 1992, created controversy when a majority of viewers believed the televised show was real. Discovery Channel started to explore the genre with some success from 1996. The Fox Broadcasting Company had a news-style oriented show, Sightings, that was hosted by Tim White (newscaster/reporter) and this show lasted for six years. MTV's Fear premiered in 2000, establishing the visual look and editing style followed by most paranormal reality television show. In 2002, the British satellite channel Living TV launched the ghost-hunting series ""Most Haunted"". Its success helped spawn other shows on the channel, including ""Dead Famous"" and ""Jane Goldman Investigates"", and the channel developed a distinctive identity based on paranormal programming. The production company responsible for these programs, Antix, also produced two series of ""Spook School"" which followed the investigators of Para-Projects as they teach members of the public how to become paranormal investigators themselves. Other notable shows include ""Creepy Canada"", ""Proof Positive"", ""America's Haunted Hotels"", ""Ghost Hunters"" (not to be confused with the earlier European ""Ghosthunters""), ""Ghost Adventures"", and ""A Haunting"". YTV, a Canadian youth-oriented station, has a more toned-down version of similar programming called ""Mystery Hunters"". Noting the recent trend in reality shows that take the paranormal at face value, New York Times Culture editor Mike Hale characterized ghost hunting shows as ""pure theater"" and compared the genre to professional wrestling or soft core pornography for its formulaic, teasing approach. ""LA Times"" staff writer Ed Stockly wrote that ""the paranormal/supernatural-investigation subgenre that has cropped up on cable television over the last few years, which includes Ghost Hunters, Destination Truth, Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters International and a few others"" promises to ""take a skeptical approach in its investigations and to rely on science to confirm or disprove paranormal claims. So far not one has been able to consistently keep that promise."" "
wikipedia-2309645," 2006 Formula One season  The 2006 Formula One season was the 57th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 2006 FIA Formula One World Championship which began on 12 March and ended on 22 October after eighteen races. The Drivers' Championship was won by Fernando Alonso of Renault F1 for the second year in a row, with Alonso becoming the youngest ever double world champion at the time. Then-retiring multiple world champion Michael Schumacher of Scuderia Ferrari finished runner-up, 13 points behind. The Constructors' Championship was won by Mild Seven Renault F1 Team, which defeated Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro by five points.  The season was highlighted by the rivalry between Alonso and Schumacher, who each won seven races. Renault and Ferrari drivers dominated the field, victorious in all but one race, and the four second-place finishes not achieved by these two teams were accomplished by McLaren Mercedes. During this season for the first time since the season no British constructor won any race and like 1956, only factory teams won all the races during this year. Background. The calendar was initially announced as the same as for 2005, with the Belgian Grand Prix scheduled for 17 September. However, on 8 February, the FIA announced that the Belgian National Sporting Authority (RACB) were withdrawing Spa-Francorchamps from the 2006 Formula One calendar due to lack of time to complete improvements to the track. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offered his city's track as a possible replacement for the Belgian Grand Prix, but the FIA said that the Belgian race would not be replaced. The race has traditionally received strong support from drivers and FIA President Max Mosley and the Grand Prix was back on the Grand Prix calendar for the 2007 season. 2006 was the last season with two tyre manufacturers: The two manufacturers at the time were Japanese manufacturer Bridgestone and French company Michelin. In December 2005, the FIA announced that from the 2008 season, there would be only one tyre supplier. Five days later, Michelin announced it would quit Formula One at the end of the 2006 season as it did not want to be in Formula One as the sole tyre supplier. At the end of 2005, three well-known teams were bought out: Minardi, Sauber and Jordan. The former were bought by Red Bull to be run as a junior team to house their growing list of young talent looking for an F1 drive. Despite campaigns by Minardi fans the team were renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso (Toro Rosso), Italian for ""Team Red Bull"". The Sauber team was purchased by BMW. BMW opted to keep the Sauber name in F1 renaming the team BMW Sauber. Jordan, who had been bought by the Midland Group in 2004, changed their name to MF1 Racing after a transition year in 2005. 2006 also saw the introduction of a new Japanese team, Super Aguri F1, founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki, who entered at the last moment. Super Aguri notified the FIA on 1 November 2005 (ahead of the governing body's 15 November deadline) of their intention to enter, but the FIA's initial entry list stated they had not approved Aguri's entry. However, the team received the consent of the ten existing teams to compete and paid the US$48 million bond required as a deposit. The team was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006. Between the 2005 and 2006 season the ownership of Formula One changed significantly. Until November 2005 the Formula One group was owned by an Ecclestone family trust and Speed Investments (a grouping of Bayerische Landesbank, JP Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers). On 25 November, CVC Capital Partners announced it was to purchase both the Ecclestone shares (25% of SLEC) and Bayerische Landesbank's 48% share, held through Speed Investments. By 30 March, CVC had acquired all remaining shares and later that month the European Commission announced approval of this deal, conditional upon CVC relinquishing control of Dorna Sports, promoter of MotoGP. On 28 March CVC announced the completion of the Formula One transaction. Ecclestone reinvested proceeds of his stake into the new Formula One parent company Alpha Prema. Another Ecclestone victory involved the Grand Prix Manufacturers' Association's proposal for an alternative World Championship. On 27 March, the five car manufacturers involved lodged applications for the 2008 season, reducing the likelihood of a breakaway series. On 14 May, Grand Prix Manufacturers' Association (GPMA) members confirmed they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding, a move toward signing a new Concorde Agreement. Five days later, Bernie Ecclestone and CVC Capital Partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the GPMA which should see the five ""rebels"" continue racing in Formula One at least until the 2012 season. Season review. Renault and Fernando Alonso established early leads in the Constructors' and Drivers' Championship respectively. The defending World Champion took wins (including four consecutive victories) in Bahrain, Australia, Spain, Monaco, Britain, and Canada in the first half of the season. Teammate Giancarlo Fisichella won his third career race in Malaysia. The Malaysian event also saw allegations that a number of teams were running illegal 'flexi wings' which allowed better straight line speed. Changes were made to both the wings and the rules for the next race. After a disastrous 2005 season and slow start to the 2006 season Michael Schumacher won consecutive races at Imola and the Nürburgring. During the final lap of his qualifying session for the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher came to a stop at the La Rascasse hairpin, resulting in yellow flags, meaning that other drivers could not go at maximum speed. After the session there were immediate complaints from the other teams claiming that this was a deliberate move by Schumacher to ensure he started in pole position – Alonso's flying lap that was affected by the yellow flags had been likely to beat Schumacher's fastest time – at the end of the second sector, Alonso was more than two tenths of a second ahead of Schumacher's time, and his final time was just 0.064 seconds slower than Schumacher. Although Schumacher insisted that he had simply locked up his brakes at the corner, a stewards' inquiry stated, ""We are left with no alternative but to conclude that the driver deliberately stopped his car on the circuit."" The penalty was that Schumacher's qualifying times were all deleted, demoting him to 22nd position on the grid. He opted to start from the pitlane, and finished fifth, after an incident in the race that required the safety car to be deployed. The Safety Car failed to aid Schumacher however, but in fact hampered him; because he was the last car to be lapped by leader Alonso, and under 2006 FIA rules; he was not allowed to un-lap himself under Safety Car conditions. This meant he was almost a full lap down on third placed Coulthard, and fourth placed Barrichello on the resumption of the race. But by the end, he was threatening to pass them for position; finishing less than two seconds off a podium spot. At the British Grand Prix, Alonso became the first Spanish driver and the youngest driver (24 years and 317 days) to win a race from pole and get fastest lap, leading every lap of the race except one. Schumacher won the United States Grand Prix, his fourth consecutive victory at Indianapolis and fifth career victory there, and the French Grand Prix. The FIA decided that the 'Mass Damper' system used by Renault up to this point of the season did not meet the technical regulations, and it was banned – a polemical decision, since the FIA itself was consulted about the system during its development, and authorized its use. The effect of the ban was clear at the next race where the Renaults struggled to even get points. Schumacher also won the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, with Alonso finishing 5th.  Jenson Button achieved his first Formula One career victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Alonso had a mechanical failure whilst leading in the latter stages of the race whilst Michael Schumacher retired after a collision with Nick Heidfeld. However Schumacher was promoted to eighth place in the standings (having been classified ninth following a retirement three laps from the end) because Robert Kubica's debut ended in disqualification. The Polish driver had finished seventh in the BMW. Felipe Massa won the next Grand Prix in Turkey, so for the second race in a row, Formula One had a maiden victor. Fernando Alonso extended his lead over Michael Schumacher by two points after he managed to finish a tenth of a second ahead of the German in second place. At the Italian Grand Prix, Alonso was given a penalty for 'holding up' Massa during the final qualification session. Many in the Formula One 'paddock' were reported to disagree with the penalty and Max Moseley has since said that he would not have issued the same penalty as the race stewards. Schumacher reduced Alonso's lead to only two points after winning the race while Alonso suffered an engine failure in the late stages of the race. Despite a fourth-place finish for Alonso's teammate, Giancarlo Fisichella, and a flat-spotted tyre causing Felipe Massa to score no points, the race also saw Ferrari pull ahead of Renault for the first time in 2006. Polish driver Robert Kubica took his BMW Sauber to his first podium finish, in only his third race, but the race results were largely overshadowed by Schumacher announcing, during the post-race press conference, that he would retire at the end of the season. Afterwards he did say that he would hold a position in the Ferrari F1 team for 2007, though he did not disclose what. Three weeks later, with his victory at Shanghai right ahead of Alonso, Schumacher drew level on points with him at the head of the championship. Schumacher led the World Championship for the first time in 2006 after the race, as he had won seven races compared to Alonso's six. Massa did not finish the race, and Renault gained again the lead in the constructors' championship thanks to Fisichella's third place. A week later at the Japanese Grand Prix, Felipe Massa took pole ahead of Michael Schumacher in second and Fernando Alonso in fifth. Schumacher quickly took the lead and set about gaining a five-second lead, which continued until after the second round of pit stops. However, Schumacher's engine failed with 17 laps to go, forcing him to retire and handing Alonso the win ahead of Massa. At the final round, the Brazilian Grand Prix, Massa again took pole. Drama in qualifying saw Michael Schumacher have a mysterious failure, meaning that he started down in tenth, while Alonso began in fifth. In the race, Schumacher had yet more bad luck, suffering a puncture just a few laps in. He recovered to finish fourth, while teammate Massa became the first Brazilian to win his home Grand Prix since Ayrton Senna in 1993. Alonso finished second to secure his second successive championship, adding the record of the youngest man to secure back-to-back titles to his ever-increasing list of records. Fisichella finished sixth for Renault, meaning that the French outfit secured their second successive constructor's title. McLaren failed to secure a single win in the season for the first time since and it was the first season since that a British constructor failed to win a race. Teams and Drivers. The following teams and drivers competed in the 2006 FIA Formula One World Championship. Team changes. Four prominent names in the sport disappeared for this season, with Minardi, Sauber, BAR and Jordan withdrawing, and one new team, Super Aguri entered at the last moment. The Sauber name remained, although largely as a sentiment, as BMW owned 80% of the team to Peter Sauber's 20%. Jordan became MF1 Racing, as Midland started afresh after a disappointing first season under the Jordan name. Late in the season, the team was bought by Spyker. Honda, who already owned a 45% stake in the BAR team, completed their takeover of the team and changed its name to Honda Racing F1 Team at the start of the season. Super Aguri F1 also entered their first season after having problems entering. They received backing from Honda Racing F1 including technology and engines, due to them running Honda driver Takuma Sato. Williams introduced numerous changes for 2006, particularly changing to Cosworth V8 engines after they and BMW split. Red Bull Racing (RBR) had Ferrari engines, replacing the Cosworth power which gained them seventh in the standings in 2005. Williams and Toyota changed tyre suppliers to Bridgestone, due to Michelin's desire to supply fewer teams in the championship. Despite this Toro Rosso who under the Minardi name ran Bridgestone tyres switched to Michelin in line with parent team RBR. Driver changes. At the start of the season During the season Formula One 2006 race schedule. The Australian Grand Prix was held later than usual, to avoid a clash with the 2006 Commonwealth Games. For the first time, Bahrain hosted the first Grand Prix. Brazil hosted the last race, while Japan and China swapped their original dates. In 2006, the FIA announced the Belgian Grand Prix would not be part of the 2006 Formula One season, since the local authorities had started major repair work in Spa-Francorchamps. The Belgian Grand Prix returned in 2007, when Kimi Räikkönen took pole position and his 3rd Belgian Grand Prix win in a row. Results and standings. Constructors Championship. Note: Championship points were awarded on a 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 basis for the first eight positions in each race. If two or more drivers or constructors had the same number of points (including 0 points), their positions in the Championship were fixed according to the quality of their places. Under this system one first place was better than any number of second places, one second place was better than any number of third places, etc. Rule changes. Engine. Significant changes to the Formula One regulations were introduced for 2006. In an attempt to curb the increasing engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres and the number of cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200 bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake limiters to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded last year, with the V10 engines. Some engine suppliers indicated early that their smaller V8s can rev higher than the 19,000 rpms normal for 2005-spec V10s. Northampton-based engine builder Cosworth had an enviable record of success with V8 engines. It made further history by becoming the first manufacturer to have broken the 20,000 rpm limit on track in December 2005. Cost reduction. In the long run, the FIA intends to introduce greater restrictions on testing and the introduction of standardized electronics, tyres and brakes to reduce costs and entice more new private teams into the sport. Proposed new rules for the year 2008 led to 22 teams applying to race that season, but since currently only twelve teams can race at one time, ten of those applicants were turned down. Tyres. Tyre changes returned to Formula One in 2006. Each driver is limited to 14 sets of tyres per race weekend. This consists of seven sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of wet-weather tyres and three sets of extreme-weather tyres. The thinking behind this is that the reduced engine size will offset any performance gain. Qualifying. A new qualifying system consisting of three sessions of varying length has been introduced. A 15-minute session is held first, in which the six slowest cars from that session are eliminated and thus set in grid positions 17–22. After a five-minute break, another 15-minute session is held with the remaining cars, and again the six slowest cars are eliminated and set in positions 11–16. These twelve eliminated drivers are placed in parc fermé, but may modify fuel loads as they see fit. During a further five-minute break, the remaining 10 cars declare their fuel loads to the FIA. A final 15 minute session then decides the top 10 grid positions. Teams are allowed to run their fuel load low by making as many laps as possible, and thus improve their times as the weight falls. This is an improvement for TV audiences because teams need to run as many laps as possible to lower their fuel loads. Following this session, the top ten cars are placed in parc ferme and required to refill their fuel load to the level of that at the beginning of the final 20 minutes. Starting with the 2006 French Grand Prix, qualifying for final session was cut short to just 15 minutes, making all of the sessions the same length, and the ability for drivers to complete a flying lap after the chequered flag drop now applies in first two sessions as well. A loophole was detected by the FIA, in that teams could declare a large fuel load but on the out lap ""leak"", or use a large quantity of fuel to lighten a car and permit a faster lap. The FIA decided to only count laps that are within 110% of the driver's fastest time, and allow teams to top up with the amount of fuel used for those laps. Practice. Only one free practice session is held on Saturdays, for one hour, and it ends no less than two hours before qualifying begins, usually between 11.00 and 12.00, replacing the old system of two 45-minute sessions. Friday remains unchanged, with two one-hour sessions, starting three hours apart. Mass dampers. The tuned mass damper system was used by several teams, notably Renault, during the latter part of 2005 and the 2006 seasons. The devices were located in the nosecone, and were particularly effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. After the French Grand Prix, the FIA announced that the system would be outlawed. This had a particularly significant effect on Renault, as the team had effectively built their cars around the devices, and had introduced them as long ago as the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. At the German Grand Prix the Renault team submitted one of their cars for scrutineering by the race stewards, who ruled that the devices were acceptable. The FIA launched an appeal against this decision, and on 23 August 2006 the FIA International Court of Appeal issued a statement upholding this appeal and rejecting the stewards' decision. The Court of Appeal stated that the system infringes part of the bodywork section (Article 3.15) of the Formula One Technical Regulations, which states that: Any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance: The central argument is whether the mass dampers function as aerodynamic devices or as a part of the suspension system. The FIA reasoned that because the devices do not ""remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car"", they are illegal. But the FIA failed to explain how the damper, which is entirely enclosed with the car can be counted as bodywork when article 1.4 of the regulations define bodywork as: All entirely sprung parts of the car in contact with the external air stream, except cameras and the parts definitely associated with the mechanical functioning of the engine, transmission and running gear.

wikipedia-2309752," Komatiite  Komatiite is a type of ultramafic mantle-derived volcanic rock. Komatiites have low silicon, potassium and aluminium, and high to extremely high magnesium content. Komatiite was named for its type locality along the Komati River in South Africa. True komatiites are very rare and essentially restricted to rocks of Archean age, with few Proterozoic or Phanerozoic komatiites known (although high-magnesian lamprophyres are known from the Mesozoic). This restriction in age is thought to be due to cooling of the mantle, which may have been up to 500 °C hotter during the early to middle Archaean (3.8 to 2.8 Ga). The early Earth had much higher heat production, due to the residual heat from planetary accretion, as well as the greater abundance of radioactive elements. Geographically, komatiites are restricted in distribution to the Archaean shield areas. Komatiites occur with other ultramafic and high-magnesian mafic volcanic rocks in Archaean greenstone belts. The youngest komatiites are from the island of Gorgona on the Caribbean oceanic plateau off the Pacific coast of Colombia. Petrology. Magmas of komatiitic compositions have a very high melting point, with calculated eruption temperatures in excess of 1600 °C. Basaltic lavas normally have eruption temperatures of about 1100 to 1250 °C. The higher melting temperatures required to produce komatiite have been attributed to the presumed higher geothermal gradients in the Archean Earth. Komatiitic lava was extremely fluid when it erupted (possessing the viscosity close to that of water but with the density of rock). Compared to the basaltic lava of the Hawaiian plume basalts at ~1200 °C, which flows the way treacle or honey does, the komatiitic lava would have flowed swiftly across the surface, leaving extremely thin lava flows (down to 10 mm thick). The major komatiitic sequences preserved in Archaean rocks are thus considered to be lava tubes, ponds of lava etc., where the komatiitic lava accumulated. Komatiite chemistry is different from that of basaltic and other common mantle-produced magmas, because of differences in degrees of partial melting. Komatiites are considered to have been formed by high degrees of partial melting, usually greater than 50%, and hence have high MgO with low K2O and other incompatible elements. Kimberlite, another magnesium-rich igneous rock, is relatively rich in potassium and in other incompatible elements, and is thought to form as a result of less than a percent or so of partial melting fluxed by water and carbon dioxide. There are two geochemical classes of komatiite; aluminium undepleted komatiite (AUDK) (also known as Group I komatiites) and aluminium depleted komatiite (ADK) (also known as Group II komatiites), defined by their Al2O3/TiO2 ratios. These two classes of komatiite are often assumed to represent a real petrological source difference between the two types related to depth of melt generation. Al-depleted komatiites have been modeled by melting experiments as being produced by high degrees of partial melting at high pressure where garnet in the source is not melted, whereas Al-undepleted komatiites are produced by high degrees of partial melts at lesser depth. However, recent studies of fluid inclusions in chrome spinels from the cumulate zones of komatiite flows have shown that a single komatiite flow can be derived from the mixing of parental magmas with a range of Al2O3/TiO2 ratios, calling into question this interpretation of the formations of the different komatiite groups. Komatiites probably form in extremely hot mantle plumes. Boninite magmatism is similar to komatiite magmatism but is produced by fluid-fluxed melting above a subduction zone. Boninites with 10–18% MgO tend to have higher large-ion lithophile elements (LILE: Ba, Rb, Sr) than komatiites. Mineralogy. The pristine volcanic mineralogy of komatiites is composed of forsteritic olivine (Fo90 and upwards), calcic and often chromian pyroxene, anorthite (An85 an upwards) and chromite. A considerable population of komatiite examples show a cumulate texture and morphology. The usual cumulate mineralogy is highly magnesium rich forsterite olivine, though chromian pyroxene cumulates are also possible (though rarer). Volcanic rocks rich in magnesium may be produced by accumulation of olivine phenocrysts in basalt melts of normal chemistry: an example is picrite. Part of the evidence that komatiites are not magnesium-rich simply because of cumulate olivine is textural: some contain spinifex, a texture attributable to rapid crystallization of the olivine in a thermal gradient in the upper part of a lava flow. Another line of evidence is that the MgO content of olivines formed in komatiites is toward the nearly pure MgO forsterite composition, which can only be achieved in bulk by crystallisation of olivine from a highly magnesian melt. The often rarely preserved flow top breccia and pillow margin zones in some komatiite flows are essentially volcanic glass, quenched in contact with overlying water or air. Because they are rapidly cooled, they represent the liquid composition of the komatiites, and thus record an anhydrous MgO content of up to 32% MgO. Some of the highest magnesian komatiites with clear textural preservation are those of the Weltevreden Formation of the Barberton belt in South Africa, where liquids with up to 34% MgO can be inferred using bulk rock and olivine compositions. The mineralogy of a komatiite varies systematically through the typical stratigraphic section of a komatiite flow and reflects magmatic processes which komatiites are susceptible to during their eruption and cooling. The typical mineralogical variation is from a flow base composed of olivine cumulate, to a spinifex textured zone composed of bladed olivine and ideally a pyroxene spinifex zone and olivine-rich chill zone on the upper eruptive rind of the flow unit. The ""spinifex"" texture is named after an Australian grass that grows in clumps with similar shapes. Primary (magmatic) mineral species also encountered in komatiites include olivine, the pyroxenes augite, pigeonite and bronzite, plagioclase, chromite, ilmenite and rarely pargasitic amphibole. Secondary (metamorphic) minerals include serpentine, chlorite, amphibole, sodic plagioclase, quartz, iron oxides and rarely phlogopite, baddeleyite, and pyrope or hydrogrossular garnet. Metamorphism. All known komatites have been metamorphosed, therefore should technically be termed 'metakomatiite' though the prefix meta is inevitably assumed. Many komatiites are highly altered and serpentinized or carbonated from metamorphism and metasomatism. This results in significant changes to the mineralogy and the texture. Hydration vs. carbonation. The metamorphic mineralogy of ultramafic rocks, particularly komatiites, is only partially controlled by composition. The character of the connate fluids which are present during low temperature metamorphism whether prograde or retrograde control the metamorphic assemblage of a metakomatiite (""hereafter the prefix meta- is assumed""). The factor controlling the mineral assemblage is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the metamorphic fluid, called the XCO2. If XCO2 is above 0.5, the metamorphic reactions favor formation of talc, magnesite (magnesium carbonate), and tremolite amphibole. These are classed as talc-carbonation reactions. Below XCO2 of 0.5, metamorphic reactions in the presence of water favor production of serpentinite. There are thus two main classes of metamorphic komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form a series of rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates. Mineralogic variations in komatiite flow facies. Komatiite tends to fractionate from high-magnesium compositions in the flow bases where olivine cumulates dominate, to lower magnesium compositions higher up in the flow. Thus, the current metamorphic mineralogy of a komatiite will reflect the chemistry, which in turn represents an inference as to its volcanological facies and stratigraphic position. Typical metamorphic mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in the upper spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend to be free from tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated. The upper flow facies tend to be dominated by talc, chlorite, tremolite, and other magnesian amphiboles (anthophyllite, cummingtonite, gedrite, etc.). For example, the typical flow facies (see below) may have the following mineralogy; Geochemistry. Komatiite can be classified according to the following geochemical criteria; The above geochemical classification must be the essentially unaltered magma chemistry and not the result of crystal accumulation (as in peridotite). Through a typical komatiite flow sequence the chemistry of the rock will change according to the internal fractionation which occurs during eruption. This tends to lower MgO, Cr, Ni towards the top, and increases Al, K2O, Na and CaO and SiO2 toward the top of the flow. Rocks rich in MgO, K2O, Ba, Cs, and Rb may be lamprophyres, kimberlites or other rare ultramafic, potassic or ultrapotassic rocks. Morphology and occurrence. Komatiites often show pillow lava structure, autobrecciated upper margins consistent with underwater eruption forming a rigid upper skin to the lava flows. Proximal volcanic facies are thinner and interleaved with sulfidic sediments, black shales, cherts and tholeiitic basalts. Komatiites were produced from a relatively wet mantle. Evidence of this is from their association with felsics, occurrences of komatiitic tuffs, Niobium anomalies and by S- and H2O-borne rich mineralizations. Textural features. A common and distinctive texture is known as ""spinifex texture"" and consists of long acicular phenocrysts of olivine (or pseudomorphs of alteration minerals after olivine) or pyroxene which give the rock a bladed appearance especially on a weathered surface. Spinifex texture is the result of rapid crystallization of highly magnesian liquid in the thermal gradient at the margin of the flow or sill.. ""Harrisite texture"", first described from the locality of Harris Bay, Rùm, Scotland, is formed by nucleation of crystals on the floor of the lava flow chamber. Harrisites are known to form megacrystal aggregates of pyroxene and olivine up to 1 metre in length. Volcanology. Komatiite volcano morphology is interpreted to have the general form and structure of a shield volcano, typical of most large basalt edifices, as the magmatic event which forms komatiites erupts less magnesian materials. However, the initial flux of the most magnesian magmas is interpreted to form a channelised flow facie, which is envisioned as a fissure vent releasing highly fluid komatiitic lava onto the surface. This then flows outwards from the vent fissure, concentrating into topographical lows, and forming channel environments composed of high MgO olivine adcumulate flanked by a 'sheeted flow facies' aprons of lower MgO olivine and pyroxene thin-flow spinifex sheets. The typical komatiite lava flow has six stratigraphically related elements; Individual flow units may not be entirely preserved, as subsequent flow units may thermally erode the A zone spinifex flows. In the distal thin flow facies, B zones are poorly developed to absent, as not enough through-flowing liquid existed to grow the adcumulate. The channel and sheeted flows are then covered by high-magnesian basalts and tholeiitic basalts as the volcanic event evolves to less magnesian compositions. The subsequent magmatism, being higher silica melts, tends to form a more typical shield volcano architecture. Intrusive komatiites. Komatiite magma is extremely dense and unlikely to reach the surface, being more likely to pool lower within the crust. Modern (post-2004) interpretations of some of the larger olivine adcumulate bodies in the Yilgarn craton have revealed that the majority of komatiite olivine adcumulate occurrences are likely to be subvolcanic to intrusive in nature. This is recognised at the Mt Keith nickel deposit where wall-rock intrusive textures and xenoliths of felsic country rocks have been recognised within the low-strain contacts. The previous interpretations of these large komatiite bodies was that they were ""super channels"" or reactivated channels, which grew to over 500 m in stratigraphic thickness during prolonged volcanism. These intrusions are considered to be channelised sills, formed by injection of komatiitic magma into the stratigraphy, and inflation of the magma chamber. Economic nickel-mineralised olivine adcumulate bodies may represent a form of sill-like conduit, where magma pools in a staging chamber before erupting onto the surface. Economic importance. The economic importance of komatiite was first widely recognised in the early 1960s with the discovery of massive nickel sulfide mineralisation at Kambalda, Western Australia. Komatiite-hosted nickel-copper sulfide mineralisation today accounts for about 14% of the world's nickel production, mostly from Australia, Canada and South Africa. Komatiites are associated with nickel and gold deposits in Australia, Canada, South Africa and most recently in the Guiana shield of South America. "
wikipedia-2309765," KAI T-50 Golden Eagle  The KAI T-50 Golden Eagle is a family of South Korean supersonic advanced trainers and multirole light fighters, developed by Korea Aerospace Industries with Lockheed Martin. The T-50 is South Korea's first indigenous supersonic aircraft and one of the world's few supersonic trainers. Development began in the late 1990s, and its maiden flight occurred in 2002. The aircraft entered active service with the Republic of Korea Air Force in 2005. The T-50 has been further developed into aerobatic and combat variants, namely T-50B, TA-50, and FA-50. The F-50 is another advanced fighter variant being considered. The T-50B serves with the South Korean air force's aerobatics team. The TA-50 light attack variant has been ordered by Indonesia. Additional export orders are being pursued by Iraq, Poland, and Spain. The Philippines has begun contract negotiations to order the FA-50 variant. The T-50 is also being marketed as a candidate for the United States Air Force's next-generation T-X trainer programme. Development. Origins. The T-50 program was originally intended to develop an indigenous trainer aircraft capable of supersonic flight, to train and prepare pilots for the KF-16 and F-15K, replacing trainers such as T-38 and A-37 that were then in service with the Republic of Korea Air Force. Prior South Korean aircraft programs include the propeller-driven KT-1 basic trainer produced by Daewoo Aerospace (now part of KAI), and license-manufactured KF-16. In general, the T-50 series of aircraft closely resembles the KF-16 in configuration. The mother program, code-named KTX-2, began in 1992, but the Ministry of Finance and Economy suspended KTX-2 in 1995 due to financial constraints. The basic design of the aircraft was set by 1999. The development of the aircraft was funded 70% by the South Korean government, 17% by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), and 13% by Lockheed Martin. The aircraft was formally designated as ""T-50 Golden Eagle"" in February 2000. The ""T-50A"" designation was reserved by the U.S. military to prevent to it from being inadvertently assigned to another aircraft model. Final assembly of the first T-50 took place between 15 January and 14 September 2001. The first flight of the T-50 took place in August 2002, and initial operational assessment from 28 July to 14 August 2003. KAI and Lockheed Martin are currently pursuing a joint marketing program for the T-50 internationally. The South Korean air force placed a production contract for 25 T-50s in December 2003, with aircraft scheduled to be delivered between 2005 and 2009. Original T-50 aircraft are equipped with the AN/PG-67(v)4 radar from Lockheed Martin. The Golden Eagle series is equipped with the a GE F404 engine with Full Authority Digital Control (FADC); it is built under license by Samsung Techwin. Under terms of a T-50/F404-102 co-production agreement, GE provides engine kits directly to Samsung Techwin who produces designated parts as well as performs final engine assembly and test. Improved versions. The program has expanded beyond a trainer concept to include the ""TA-50"" light attack aircraft, as well as the ""FA-50"" multirole fighter similar to the multirole KF-16. The TA-50 variant is a more heavily armed version of the T-50 trainer, intended for lead-in fighter training and light attack roles. It is equipped with the Elta EL/M-2032 fire control radar. The TA-50 is designed to operate as a full-fledged combat platform for precision-guided weapons, air-to-air missiles, and air-to-ground missiles. The TA-50 can mount additional utility pods for reconnaissance, targeting assistance, and electronic warfare. Reconnaissance and electronic warfare variants are also being developed, designated as RA-50 and EA-50. The FA-50 is the most advanced version of the T-50. It is equipped with a modified Israeli EL/M-2032 pulse-Doppler radar with further Korean-specific modifications by LIG Nex1, and has more internal fuel capacity, enhanced avionics, a longer radome and a tactical datalink. The radar selected for the FA-50 has a range two-thirds greater than the TA-50's radar. The EL/M-2032 was initially chosen over Lockheed Martin's preferred AN/APG-67(V)4 and SELEX Vixen 500E AESA radars. Other AESA radars such as Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar and Northrop Grumman's Scalable Agile Beam Radar are options for future production, and will likely be shared with the same AESA radar chosen for the USAF and ROKAF F-16 fighters. Samsung Thales is also independently developing a domestic multi-mode AESA radar for FA-50. In December 2008, South Korea awarded a contract to Korea Aerospace Industries to convert four T-50s to FA-50 standards by 2012. In 2012, The Republic of Korea Air Force has ordered 20 FA-50 fighters to be delivered by the end of 2014. The maiden flight of FA-50 multirole fighter variant took place in 2011. The 60 FA-50 aircraft are to be produced from 2013 to 2016. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) received a 1.1 trillion won ($1 billion) order for FA-50 fighter aircraft in May 2013. The T-50 is the proposed base for the more advanced F-50 fighter with strengthened wings, AESA radar, more internal fuel, enhanced electronic warfare capability, and a more powerful engine. The proposal is designated as T-50 Phase 3 program by KAI. Wing strengthening is required to support three underwing weapons pylons, compared to two underwing pylons on the TA-50 or FA-50. The AESA radar was expected to be RACR, which has 90% commonality with the AESA radar of the Super Hornet, or SABR, both of which are competing for KF-16's AESA radar upgrade program. Samsung Thales' AESA radar is also a possible option. The aircraft was altered to a single-seat configuration to allow more space for internal fuel and electronic warfare equipment. The engine could be either Eurojet EJ200 or General Electric F414, upgraded to 20,000 lb or 22,000 lb thrust, which is about 12-25% higher than the F404's thrust. The engines are already being offered for the baseline T-50 for future customers. A similar Korean-led international fighter program exists named the KAI KF-X. Design. Overview. The T-50 Golden Eagle design is largely derived from the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and they have many similarities: use of a single engine, speed, size, cost, and the range of weapons. KAI's previous engineering experience in license-producing the KF-16 was a starting point for the development of the T-50. The trainer can carry two pilots in tandem seating. The high-mounted canopy developed by Hankuk Fiber is applied with stretched acrylic, providing the pilots with good visibility, and has been tested to offer the canopy with ballistic protection against 4-lb objects impacting at 400 knots. The altitude limit is 14,600 metres (48,000 ft), and airframe is designed to last 8,000 hours of service. There are seven internal fuel tanks with capacity of 2,655 litres (701 US gal), five in the fuselage and two in the wings. An additional 1,710 litres (452 US gal) of fuel can be carried in the three external fuel tanks. T-50 trainer variants have a paint scheme of white and red, and aerobatic variants white, black, and yellow. The T-50 Golden Eagle uses a single General Electric F404-102 turbofan engine license-produced by Samsung Techwin, upgraded with a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system jointly developed by General Electric and Korea Aerospace Industries. The engine consists of three-staged fans, seven axial stage arrangement, and an afterburner. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 1.5. Its engine produces a maximum of 78.7 kN (17,700 lbf) of thrust with afterburner. The more powerful F414 and EJ200 engines have been suggested as the new engine for the T-50 family. Avionics. The T-50's central processing unit and its operating system are developed by MDS Technology. The T-50's NEOS avionics operating system is the first and only real-time operating system to be developed by an Asian company, and holds both DO-178B and IEEE POSIX certification. Samsung Thales and LIG Nex1 are the main avionics and electronic warfare equipment developers for T-50 and its variants. Other South Korean companies and defense institutes such as DoDAAM Systems, Aeromaster, Intellics, and Korea Institute of Defense Analysis are responsible for the aircraft's secondary avionics and embedded systems, including store management computers, avionics testing equipment, flight data recorders, portable maintenance aids, data analysis software, post-flight data processing system, aircraft structure and engine management software, and mission planning and support systems. The TA-50 version is equipped with an ELTA EL/M-2032 fire control radar. The T-50 is equipped with a Honeywell H-764G embedded global positioning/inertial navigation system and HG9550 radar altimeter. The aircraft is the first trainer to feature triple-redundant digital fly-by-wire controls. The cockpit panels, switches, and joysticks are produced by South Korea's FirsTec and Sungjin Techwin, head-up display by DoDaaM Systems, and multi-function display by Samsung Thales. Other South Korean subcontractors such as Elemech, Dawin Friction, and Withus cooperate in T-50 components production. Hanwha supplies the mechanical parts for the flight control system, and WIA supplies the undercarriage. Armament and equipment. The TA-50 version mounts a three-barrel cannon version of the M61 Vulcan internally behind the cockpit, which fires linkless 20 mm ammunition. Wingtip rails can accommodate the AIM-9 Sidewinders missile, a variety of additional weapons can be mounted to underwing hardpoints. Compatible air-to-surface weapons include the AGM-65 Maverick missile, Hydra 70 and LOGIR rocket launchers, CBU-58 and Mk-20 cluster bombs, and Mk-82, −83, and −84 general purpose bombs. FA-50 can be externally fitted with Rafael's Sky Shield or LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K ECM pods, Sniper or LITENING targeting pods, and Condor 2 reconnaissance pods to further improve the fighter's electronic warfare, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities. Other improved weapon systems over TA-50 include SPICE multifunctional guidance kits, Textron CBU-97/105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon with WCMD tail kits, JDAM, and JDAM-ER for more comprehensive air-to-ground operations, and AIM-120 missiles for BVR air-to-air operations. FA-50 has provisions for, but does not yet integrate, Python and Derby missiles, also produced by Rafael, and other anti-ship missiles, stand-off weapons, and sensors to be domestically developed by Korea. Operational history. Republic of Korea. In 2011, the first squadron with the TA-50, the T-50's light attack variant, become operational with the Republic of Korea Air Force. South Korean air force's aerobatics team operates the T-50B version. Indonesia. Indonesia had been considering the T-50 to replace the BAE Hawk and A-4 Skyhawk as the T-50 had excellent interoperability with the current Indonesian F-16s. In August 2010, Indonesia announced that T-50, Yak-130 and L-159 were the remaining candidates for its requirement for 16 advanced jet trainers. In May 2011, Indonesia signed a contract to order 16 TA-50 aircraft for $400 million. The aircraft is to feature weapons pylons and gun modules, enabling light attack capabilities. The Golden Eagles are to replace the Hawk Mk 53 in TNI–AU service. Indonesia's version has been designated ""T-50i"". Deliveries began in September 2013. Possible sales. The T-50 was competing for a Polish Air Force order for 16 aircraft with ex-Finnish Air Force BAE Hawk 51s, refurbished by the Finnish defence company, Patria. In 2010 a first tender for lead-in fighter trainer aircraft (LIFT) was issued, but it was cancelled in 2011 after BAE Hawk T2/128 and Aero L-159 Alca had withdrawn from the contest due to requirements for fly-by-wire, supersonic speed and combat capacity, leaving the T-50P and M-346 bids. In 2012, the competition was relaunched with specifications for eight Advanced Jet Trainers (AJT). In June 2013 initial proposals from BAE Systems offering Hawk AJT, Lockheed Martin UK with (KAI) T-50, and Alenia Aermacchi M-346 were offered. The winner of this competition is planned to begin replacing the PZL TS-11 Iskra in 2015. The Spanish Air Force is interested in a cooperation agreement with South Korea for use of training aircraft, including the supersonic T-50. Iraq was negotiating the acquisition of T-50 trainer jets, having first publicly expressed official interest during the Korea-Iraq summit in Seoul on 24 February 2009. In April 2010, Iraq has reopened the jet lead-in fighter-trainer competition for 24 aircraft, in which TA-50 will compete. The Philippine Air Force initially choose 12 KAI TA-50 aircraft to fulfill its requirement for a light attack trainer. The Philippines Department of National Defence (DND) announced the selection of the type in August 2012. Philippines' Congress approved funding for 12 trainer aircraft in September 2012. The Korean government stated in August 2012 that the aircraft had not been ordered and that the two nations have to first reach an agreement on its export. In late January 2013, state media reported that the FA-50, not the TA-50 as earlier reported, was selected with 18.9 billion pesos (US$464 million) set aside for 12 aircraft; contract negotiations are underway. On 27 August 2013, Philippine Air Force Commanding General Lt. Gen. Lauro Catalino de la Cruz stated that plans are for the first two FA-50s are to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2014, with deliveries continuing until 2016. The United Arab Emirates is seeking 35–40 fighter-trainers. In February 2009, UAE selected the M-346 over the T-50. But in January 2010, UAE reopened the trainer contest. In 2011, it was confirmed that T-50 is still competing in UAE. In the United States, South Korea will attempt to sell T-50s and buy F-35s. The T-50 is one of the contenders for the US Air Force's T-X program, with an opportunity to export 300 to 1,000 aircraft worth about $6 billion to $20 billion. Azerbaijan has expressed interest in purchasing T-50 trainers. Failed Bids. Singapore evaluated the T-50 against the Italian Alenia Aermacchi M-346 and the BAE Hawk for a $500 million trainer acquisition program contract for 12–16 aircraft. The Singapore Ministry of Defense eventually selected the M-346 aircraft ahead of T-50 and BAE Hawk in July 2010. Israel has been evaluating the T-50 as a possible replacement for its Douglas TA-4H Skyhawk trainers since 2003. On 16 February 2012, Israel announced its decision to procure thirty M-346 instead. "

wikipedia-2309869," Frank Henenlotter  Frank Henenlotter, (born August 29, 1950 in New York City), is an American screenwriter, director and film historian. He is known primarily for his horror comedies, though he would prefer to be classified as an ""exploitation"" filmmaker (rather than horror). ""I never felt that I made ‘horror films’, he has said. ""I always felt that I made exploitation films. Exploitation films have an attitude more than anything – an attitude that you don’t find with mainstream Hollywood productions. They’re a little ruder, a little raunchier, they deal with material people don’t usually touch on, whether it’s sex or drugs or rock and roll."" Biography. Henelotter's films were inspired by the exploitation and sexploitation films he loved, the kind which played on 42nd Street in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. His films are low-budget and filled with gore and special-effects. They are considered by many to be B-movies, but they also turned the conventions of these films upon themselves. Although many of his films are somewhat obscure, his most well-known are ""Basket Case"", ""Brain Damage"" and ""Frankenhooker"". Hiatus and return. Following """", Henenlotter became deeply involved in the release slate of the specialty video releasing outfit, Something Weird Video; he has also been instrumental in rescuing many low-budget sexploitation and exploitation films from being destroyed, including the camp classic ""The Curious Dr. Humpp"" (1971). Many of these works have been released under Something Weird's specialty logo, ""Frank Henenlotter's Sexy Shockers.""  During the 16 years following ""BC 3,"" a number of Henenlotter feature projects came close to production, including ""Sick in the Head,"" Henenlotter's first script collaboration with R.A. the Rugged Man, at one point scheduled to be produced under the aegis of Fangoria Magazine, but, coincidental with the general economic downturn, financing evaporated. Henenlotter has also noted the conflicts he had with producers over the film, who forced the filmmaker to walk after urging him to reedit his script so it would be ""more like ""Saw""."" ""R.A. subsequently was able to find a new deal and very modest financing through his music industry contacts, so ""Bad Biology"" was conceived to be shot for an extremely low budget, for extremely limited, unrated theatrical play, and subsequent video release. Though only attendees at film festivals and special film events have had the opportunity to see the film (shot in traditional 35mm at Henenlotter's insistence) projected in a theater, Henenlotter claims the low budget, independent financing and the decision to forgo the ratings process allowed him a level of freedom he has been missing since his earliest films. ""Bad Biology"" was scheduled for video release in January 2010 by Media Blasters. Henenlotter appeared as himself in the documentary film Herschell Gordon Lewis – The Godfather of Gore and narrated the film on the 2010 FanTasia. In issue #304 Frank and comic artist Joshua Emerick started the BasketCase comic strip for Fangoria. The three panel strip runs in each issue. "
wikipedia-2309877," Arsenate  The arsenate ion is AsO43−. An arsenate (compound) is any compound that contains this ion. Arsenates are salts or esters of arsenic acid. The arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As. Arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table.  Arsenates are moderate oxidizers, with an electrode potential of +0.56 for reduction to arsenites. Occurrence. Arsenates occur naturally in a variety of minerals. Those minerals may contain hydrated or anhydrous arsenates. Unlike phosphates, arsenates are not lost from a mineral during weathering. Examples of arsenate-containing minerals include adamite, alarsite, annabergite, erythrite and legrandite. Arsenate poisoning. Arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This yields 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead, which is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost - arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity. As with other arsenic compounds, arsenate can also inhibit the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, blocking the Krebs cycle and therefore resulting in further loss of ATP. Bacteria using and generating arsenate. Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. In 2010, a team at NASA's Astrobiology Institute cultured samples of arsenic-resistant GFAJ-1 bacteria from Mono Lake, using a medium high in arsenate and low in phosphate concentration. The findings suggest that the bacteria may partially incorporate arsenate in place of phosphate in some biomolecules, including DNA, However, these claims were immediately debated and critiqued in correspondence to the original journal of publication, and have since come to be widely disbelieved. Reports refuting the most significant aspects of the original results have been published in the journal of the original research in 2012, including by researchers from the University of British Columbia and Princeton University. Following the publication of the articles challenging the conclusions of the original Science article first describing GFAJ-1 it was argued that the original article should be retracted because of misrepesentation of critical data.

wikipedia-2309890," International school  An International school is loosely defined as a school that promotes international education, in an international environment, either by adopting an international curriculum such as that of the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge International Examinations, or by following a national curriculum different from that of the country the school is located in. More specifically, at a conference in Italy in 2009 the International Association of School Librarianship came up with a list criteria for describing an international school . They are as follows: These schools cater mainly to students who are not nationals of the host country, such as the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Many local students attend these schools to learn the language of the international school and to obtain qualifications for employment or higher education in a foreign country. In April 2007 there were 4,179 ‘English-speaking international schools. with this number set to rise with globalisation. Already in New Delhi worldwide entries for the Cambridge IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) June 2009 examination session are up by almost 20% on the same session last year. The strong growth confirms the status of Cambridge IGCSE as the world's, and India's, most popular international curriculum for 14-16 year olds, indicating that despite the global financial crises education is still a valued investment. International Schooling allows children to become global citizens by providing a rigorous and comprehensive education with full immersion into multiple languages and cultures. In April 2007 there were 4,179 ‘English-speaking international schools’. Establishment. The first International schools were founded in the latter half of the 19th century in countries such as Japan, Switzerland and Turkey. Early International schools were set up for those who are constantly on the move, like children of personnel of international companies, international organizations, NGOs, embassy staff with the help of nations having large interests in the hosting nation: for instance, American diplomats and missionaries often set up schools to educate their children; children of American military and army families often attended Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS); French diplomats and business families founded similar schools based on the French curriculum. Over time globalization has proven that education no longer can exist solely on a national level. “In a global economy, it is no longer improvement by national standards alone. The best performing education systems internationally provide the benchmark for success,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría launching the annual ‘education at a glance’ report in Paris. Increased movement of people around the globe has created a generation of children growing up and residing in foreign countries, creating and expanding this market for international schools that can cater for their educational needs. Curriculum. International schools typically use curricula based on the school's country of origin. The most common international schools represent Education in the United Kingdom or Education in the United States. Many international schools use curricula specially designed for international school such as the International General Certificate of Secondary Education or the IB Diploma Programme that are all predominantly committed to the notion of internationalism and the global citizen and providing an environment for optimal learning and teaching in an international setting that fosters understanding, independence, interdependence, and cooperation. The United Nations International School (UNIS) was established in 1947 by a group of United Nations Parents to promote an international education for their children, while preserving their diverse cultural heritages. This was the very first school offering the International Baccalaureate program . The school promotes the appreciation of the diversity of persons and cultures, provides an optimal environment for learning and teaching, and offers a global curriculum that inspires in its students the spirit and ideals of the United Nations Charter. Like other schools, international schools teach the subjects such as language arts, mathematics, the sciences, humanities, the arts, physical education, information technology, and design technology. More recent developments specifically for primary school include the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP). There are currently 3063 schools offering the international baccalaureate curriculum in the world.  For expatriate families, international schools allow some continuity in education and most prefer to stay in the same curriculum, especially for older children. Relocation services and institutions like School Choice International can help families choose the right school and curriculum for their child. Faculty. Faculty at International Schools are usually from or certified by the standards of their country of origin. However there are many exceptions. The most common exception is when the international school requires a teacher trained specifically for an international syllabus or for teaching a foreign language rare to the international school's country of origin. Hiring is frequently done at large international job fairs, such as the ones held by the Council of International Schools (CIS), where schools can interview and hire several teachers at once. There are also a handful of agencies which specialise in recruiting international teachers. Over the years it has become harder to recruit young international teachers, partly because of international security fears, partly because the compensation packages are not as attractive as they used to be. In some countries such as South Korea, recent visa changes have also made it more difficult to obtain both qualified and unqualified teachers. "
wikipedia-2309897," Sat Sri Akaal  Sat Sri Akal (, Pronunciation: ) is a greeting in the Punjabi language used mostly by the followers of the Sikh religion. sat means ""truth"", sri is an ""honorific word"" and Akaal (or Akal) means ""the timeless being, God"" and thus the phrase can roughly be translated to, “""God is the ultimate truth""”. Sat Sri Akaal is exclusively used by Sikhs to greet each other, as their tenth master gave them the ""jaikara"", “""Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akaal""”. The saying implies that the one will be blessed eternally who says that God is the ultimate truth. In contrast, Punjabi Muslims living in the Western Punjab (Pakistani Punjab) use the Muslim greeting ""As-salamu alaykum"", and Punjabi Hindus use ""Namaskar"" or ""Namaste"". ""Sat Sri Akal"" is used by Sikhs throughout the world when greeting other Sikhs, regardless of their native language. For instance, two members of the Punjabi Diaspora who exclusively speak English may still greet each other with this blessing, although this is not universal. The saying is also the only formal greeting in the Punjabi language. The usage of Sat Sri Akal as a greeting, although used by the majority of people who identify themselves as being Punjabi Sikh, is regarded as incorrect usage by Amritdhari (Baptized) Sikhs, as the term is historically the second half of the Sikh war cry, ""Bolay So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal"", and is still used in the same way. As per the Sikh Rehat Maryada, or Code of Conduct, Amritdhari Sikhs greet each other with ""Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh"", meaning ""The Khalsa of God, Victory is of God"". Defence battle cry. Three regiments of the Indian Army, the Punjab Regiment, Sikh Regiment, and Sikh Light Infantry use it as their battle cry. Secular usage. Sat Sri Akal has become a part of secular usage as well, particularly in people of South Asian origin, particularly when they greet a Punjabi or a Sikh. While addressing Sikhs, particularly when armed with swords, non-Sikhs would use this greeting to approach them. In public gatherings, particularly in India, people often use many forms of greetings simultaneously saying hello, Salaam, Namaste, Sat Sri Akal in the same breath. "

wikipedia-2309926," Zoo Tycoon  Zoo Tycoon is a business simulation developed by Blue Fang Games and released by Microsoft Game Studios. It is a tycoon game in which the player must run a zoo and try to make a profit. Although first released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 2001, it was ported to the Nintendo DS in 2005. It was followed by two expansion packs, ' and ', which were released in 2002, as well as a sequel, ""Zoo Tycoon 2"", released in 2004. Gameplay. The goal of ""Zoo Tycoon"" is to create a thriving zoo by building exhibits to accommodate animals and keeping the guests happy. Exhibit-building is one of the primary goals of ""Zoo Tycoon"". To keep the guests and animals happy, exhibits should be suitable to the animal; for example, a lion is best suited to a savannah environment. Choices in terrain, foliage, rocks, shelters, fences, toys and the presence of zookeepers all contribute to the suitability of an exhibit and the happiness of the animal. Guest happiness is dependent on animal choice, animal happiness, buildings, and scenery. Buildings may include bathrooms, restaurants and food stands, shops, or entertainment buildings such as movie theaters. Scenery involves aesthetics that raise guest happiness slightly, such as topiary art, light posts, or benches. Keeping both animal and guest happiness allows the player to gain monetary awards and steady income. To help manage the expanding zoo, players can employ maintenance workers, zookeepers and tour guides.  There are three modes in ""Zoo Tycoon"": Tutorial, Scenario, and Freeform. Tutorial teaches the player how to build exhibits and keep guests happy. Scenario mode has the player complete a series of objectives, sometimes within a specific time-frame. These objectives may include achieving a certain guest and animal happiness, achieving a certain exhibit suitability, displaying a certain number of animals, or breeding a certain animal. Freeform allows the player to choose the amount of money and the map with which they start. They are presented with an open lot and a limited selection of animals, buildings, and scenery available for purchase. As the game progresses, more animals and items become playable. Additional animals and items may be researched, where money is invested to make them playable. Expansion packs and sequels. Zoo Tycoon was created in the wake of the success of the 1999 Hasbro Interactive game ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"", which sold well for many years. Zoo Tycoon did well enough for Microsoft and Blue Fang Games to release two expansion packs: ', which added prehistoric-themed items and animals, and ', which allowed aquatic-themed items and animals. Eventually, Microsoft bundled the expansion packs with Zoo Tycoon to create Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection which had the functionality of both expansion packs and bonus content. Third-party creations. The success of Zoo Tycoon also led to the creation of new features by fans, both fact and fiction. Mods were created to fix problems with the game and unlock new features. Many of these mods were made possible by an official program created by Blue Fang named Animal Project Editor (APE), which allows the player to easily create one's own animals or objects, with either simply renaming a premade item or creating frames one-by-one for something new. ""Zoo Tycoon 2"" was released on November 2004. Although released with fewer animals than ""Zoo Tycoon"", more animals were introduced in its expansion packs: ', ', ', and '. The first two were bundled in the Zoo Tycoon 2: Zookeeper Collection. All of them were bundled in Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection. Reception. ""Zoo Tycoon"" was received with mixed reviews, gaining an average 68 out of 100 at Metacritic. Positive reviews came from Computer Games Magazine and GameZone, which gave the game scores of 4.5 out of 5 and 8 out of 10, respectively. The more negative reviews came from Adrenaline Vault and PC Gamer. Commercially, ""Zoo Tycoon"" did quite well, with 4 million units sold worldwide from its initial release to 2004. It was also one of the top 15 best selling PC titles in the United States. ""Zoo Tycoon"" and its compiled ""Complete Collection"" also garnered several awards and accolades, gaining the Bologna New Media Prize in 2002. ""Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection"" received the Parents' Choice Foundation Gold Award - 2003, the AIAS Computer Family Title of the Year Interactive Achievement Award - 2004, the Scholastic Parent & Child Teacher’s Pick – 2004, and the Children’s Software Revue All Star Award – 2004.

wikipedia-2315523," WIHT  WIHT (99.5 FM; ""HOT 99.5"") is a Top 40 (CHR) formatted radio station that serves the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Located on the fifth floor of 1801 Rockville Pike in Rockville, Maryland, the station broadcasts 24 hours a day and is licensed to, and owned by, Clear Channel Communications. History. Long known as WGAY and located in Silver Spring, Maryland, the station ran a beautiful music format in the 1960s and 1970s, which evolved to an easy listening format by the 1980s. WGAY would often finish at number one in the Persons 12+ Arbitron radio ratings for the Washington, D.C. area during the 1970s and 1980s.  Television ads for the station in the 1970s and 1980s featured station programmer Bob Chandler relaxing in a recliner while listening to his station's light mix of music playing in the background. During the 1980s, WGAY was reported to be then President Ronald Reagan's favorite radio station. At midnight on December 26, 1991, WGAY changed branding to ""Easy 99.5"". In 1995, WGAY switched its calls and became ""Bright 99.5"", but listeners didn't accept the more up-tempo music, and the station switched back to WGAY within 10 months.  Current era. WGAY switched from the still ratings successful format permanently by the late-90s although not because its listeners were too few, but because demographically they were getting too old and therefore less desirable for radio advertisers. At 2 PM on April 13, 1999, ""Evergreen"" by Barbra Streisand was faded out with a liner touting a change, bringing the end to ""Easy 99.5"". After two days of simulcasting WTJM in New York City, the station changed to an urban oldies format at 3 PM on April 15, known as WJMO-FM (""Jam'n 99.5""). At the time, they were co-owned with AM station WJMO in Cleveland, Ohio. The format lasted for almost two years. However, with ratings on the decline due to the arguable burnout factor of the music, combined with competition from WBIG-FM (which at the time played an oldies format; they now play a classic rock format), Clear Channel (who acquired the station in 2000 due to a merger with AMFM media and had dropped the format in other markets due to similar factors) decided to take the station in a different direction. Unlike other stations that dropped the format, however, WJMO gave its listeners the weekend to say goodbye. ""Jam'n"" signed off at 7 AM on April 2, 2001; the last song played on ""Jam'n"" was ""Last Dance"", by Donna Summer. That was followed by a ""Survivor Radio"" stunt before the current contemporary hit radio format debuted as ""Hot 99.5"" at 5 PM on April 6, 2001. The first song on ""Hot"" was ""Survivor"" by Destiny's Child. With the change of format came a change in call sign to the current WIHT on April 18, 2001.  WIHT's full market signal helped competitor 104.1 WWZZ (Z104) evolve into a more modern AC direction in late 2001; WWZZ would be driven out of the format entirely in 2006 as a result of WTOP moving to WGMS' former 103.5 FM frequency. The station was also considered to be Baltimore's default Top 40 station since their previous Top 40 station, WXYV (102.7 FM, now WQSR), would flip in September 2001. (Baltimore finally got a Top 40 station in November 2009, when WCHH flipped from modern rock to Top 40 as ""Z 104-3."") The station's main competitors are CBS Radio urban-leaning Rhythmic Contemporary WPGC-FM 95.5, CBS Radio's adult top 40 WIAD (94-7 Fresh FM) and Cumulus Media's adult top 40 WRQX (Mix 107.3). WIHT-FM's HD Radio HD-2 format was flipped to Clear Channel's successful Pride Radio format at Midnight on July 16, 2013, replacing the ""Hot Spot""-branded ""New! Music"" format that had been running on the HD-2 signal since 2007. The Kane Show. Kane resigned his programming position at WFLZ/Tampa on October 31, 2006 to host morning drive at WIHT. He replaced ""The Hot Morning Mess"" with Mark Kaye, Kris Gamble and producer Ron Ross, who exited the station on November 1, 2006. The ""Kane Show"" hit the Washington, D.C.-area airwaves on November 13, 2006. The show now includes cast members Danni, Intern John, and Melanie, after Sammy and Sarah left the program. The show was named ""Best Local Morning show"" in 2009 by industry magazine ""FMQB"". The ""Kane Show"" is broadcast on seven additional radio stations, such as WNRW, ""Radio Now 98.9"", Louisville, and KWNW, Memphis. After 18 years, WFLZ's ""MJ Morning Show"" ended on February 17, 2012. It was announced that the Kane show would replace that show three days later.

wikipedia-2315602," Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria  Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria (January 5, 1614 – November 20, 1662) was an Austrian military commander, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647 to 1656, and a patron of the arts. Biography. Born at Wiener Neustadt, he was the youngest son of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574–1616), daughter of William V, Duke of Bavaria. His elder brother became Emperor Ferdinand III (1608–1657). Leopold served as a general in the Thirty Years' War and the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659). During the latter, the Spanish-Low Country forces under Leopold Wilhelm lost the Battle of Lens in an attempt to recover the city in 1648. Later in the war, he sallied forth from the Netherlands on two occasions; on the second, he successfully seized a number of northern French forts in February–March 1652, forcing the French to withdraw forces from Catalonia to reinforce their northern frontier. This assisted Spanish forces in Spain in recovering Catalonia from the French-backed Catalan rebellion. Even though Leopold Wilhelm lacked the canonical qualifications, he was invested - with the help of his father - with a number of prince-bishoprics in order to provide him with an income. Unqualified as he was, he officially only held the title administrator—nevertheless realising the full episcopal revenues—of the prince-bishoprics of Halberstadt (1628–1648), Passau (1625–1662), Breslau (1656–1662), Olmütz (1637–1662) and Strasbourg (1626–1662). In 1635, Pope Urban VIII authorised him to become the prince-archbishop of Bremen, but due to its occupation by the Swedes he never gained ""de facto"" power. He died at Vienna in 1662. Patron of the arts. When he assumed the government of the Spanish Netherlands, Leopold Wilhelm, being a great lover of art, employed several painters from the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke, including the great Flemish painter David Teniers the Younger, who he not only employed as a painter but as keeper of the collection of pictures he was then forming. With the rank and title of ""ayuda de camara,"" Teniers took up his abode in Brussels shortly after 1647. Immense sums were spent in the acquisition of paintings for the archduke, including paintings by Frans Snyders, Pieter Snayers, Daniel Seghers, Peter Franchoys, Frans Wouters, Jan van den Hoecke, Pieter Thijs, and others. A number of valuable works of the Italian masters, now in the Vienna Museum, came from Leopold's gallery after having belonged to Charles I and the duke of Buckingham. He commissioned the British painter John Michael Wright to travel to Cromwell's England, and acquire art and artefacts. When Leopold returned to Vienna, the pictures also travelled to Austria, and a Flemish priest, himself a first-rate flower painter, Van der Baren, became keeper of the archducal gallery. Leopold bequeathed his gallery to his nephew Leopold I, and it became imperial property. It is now part of the ""Kunsthistorisches Museum"" in Vienna. When the tomb of Childeric I, an early Merovingian king of the Salian Franks and father of Clovis I was discovered in 1653 (May 27) by a mason doing repairs in the church of Saint-Brice in Tournai, it was Leopold Wilhelm who had the find published in Latin.

wikipedia-2315700," The Saga Begins  ""The Saga Begins"" is a parody by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic of ""American Pie"" by Don McLean, with lyrics that humorously summarize the plot of the film """". The song's title, not mentioned anywhere in the lyrics, derives from a tagline that appeared in teaser trailers and the film poster for ""The Phantom Menace"": ""Every saga has a ""beginning"""". ""The Saga Begins"" was released as a single from the 1999 album Running with Scissors, and later appearing on the compilation album entitled The Saga Begins. History. Set to the tune of ""American Pie,"" ""The Saga Begins"" recounts the plot of """", from Obi-Wan Kenobi's point of view. Yankovic gathered most of the information he needed to write the song from Internet spoilers. Although Lucasfilm declined a request for an advance screening, Yankovic eventually attended a costly pre-screening for charity. He had done such an accurate job with the story line that after the pre-screening, he ended up making only very minor alterations. McLean not only approved the song but also has said since that his children have played it so much that he has a tendency to accidentally sing Yankovic's lyrics when performing ""American Pie"" in concert. According to Yankovic's official website, Lucasfilms' official response to the song was, ""You should've seen the smile on George Lucas' face."" This is the second ""Star Wars"" song Weird Al has created, with the first being 1985's Yoda, a parody of ""Lola"" by The Kinks. Track listing. The following tracks are on the single:  Music video.

The song was played frequently on Radio Disney and later released on ""Radio Disney Jams Volume 2"". Radio Disney took issue with his line ""Do you see him hitting on the queen?"" and removed it (so that the song skipped slightly). Yankovic, who usually doesn't like to change lyrics to suit the needs of others, provided Radio Disney with an updated version, having changed the words to ""Do you see him talking to the queen?"" He said that the alternate lyrics were preferable to the bad edit. "

wikipedia-2315780," Air Nelson  Air Nelson, a subsidiary of Air New Zealand is a regional airline based in Nelson, New Zealand. It operates services on provincial routes under the Air New Zealand Link brand.  The airline operates one type of aircraft, the 50 seat Bombardier Q300 which provides an intensive regional air service that cannot be sustained with regional jet types of this size. Until 2008, Air Nelson operated the 33-seat Saab 340 that took over provincial Fokker F27 services by Air New Zealand in 1990. Air Nelson Q300s wear the Air New Zealand livery and operate from Kerikeri in the far north of the North Island to Invercargill in the far south of the South Island. History. The airline was established and started operations in 1979. It was founded by Robert Inglis and Nicki Smith who later sold the airline to Air New Zealand. It has 417 employees (at March 2007). As a small commuter airline, Air Nelson operated in the top half of the South Island linking Nelson and Wellington with up to half-hourly services. Also providing isolated towns such as Takaka and Motueka with a convenient safe service to the outside world. During this time aircraft ranged in type from - Piper PA-31 Navajo, Fairchild Metro, and Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. Growth. In 1986, Air New Zealand announced it would start to scale back its Fokker F27 operations and smaller regional centres were the first affected. Air Nelson aircraft immediately replaced the F27 on those routes. Air Nelson grew their network at the same time and started operating non-stop service to Auckland, complementing F27 services. Air New Zealand also purchased a stake in Air Nelson (along with Eagle Airways) to secure the airline's support when deregulation saw the arrival of Ansett New Zealand. Destinations. Air Nelson serve the following as of July 2013 New Era. Saab 340. 1990 was a significant year for Air Nelson as in August that year, Air New Zealand suspended all F27 services. Air Nelson responded by introducing the Saab 340. Up until 1992, the Saab 340 wore Air Nelson colours, but when Air New Zealand bought the airline outright all Air Nelson's fleet were repainted in Air New Zealand's 'Link' livery. The Saab fleet soon grew to one of the largest in the world at that time and Air Nelson divested itself of its smaller aircraft operating only the Saab. This was in line with the policy of parent company Air New Zealand's desire to rationalising the overall cost of fleet maintenance. Eagle Airways soon operated a fleet of Beechcraft 1900Ds, while Mount Cook Airlines operated the ATR 72-500. Larger Aircraft. Bombardier Q300. During October 2004 the airline announced that it was replacing its fleet of seventeen Saab 340As with seventeen Bombardier Dash 8 Q300 aircraft, with options for another ten Dash 8 Q300 and thirteen Dash 8 Q400 aircraft although the latter aircraft options have been dropped. The last Saab 340A aircraft had been withdrawn from service by the end of 2007. The company now has 23 Dash 8 Q300 aircraft. Air Nelson is the largest singular operator of the Q300 outside Canada. Although Air Nelson looked towards ATR for the smaller ATR 42, Bombardier offered a better discount for a bulk purchase. New Services and Expansion. The increase in fleet size allowed Air New Zealand to start pioneering longer distance provincial routes which were considered sustainable with 50 seat aircraft, such as Wellington to Invercargill, New Plymouth and Tauranga to Christchurch. Air New Zealand has also used the Q300 to ramp up a more intensive high-frequency regional service allowing more departure choices. A new route, Paraparaumu to Auckland started in 2011. The Hokitika – Christchurch route joined the Air Nelson network as a result of the Pike River coal mine disaster in November 2010 when Air New Zealand added capacity to the Westland town. This became permanent in February 2011 when subsidiary operator, Air National was grounded by the NZCAA due to irregularities with operating practises. The larger aircraft has proved popular on peak services to the West Coast airport which also serves the town of Greymouth. The Future. Bombardier has ceased building turboprop aircraft apart from the larger Q400, choosing to focus on its Regional Jet family and upcoming C-Series twinjets. This has left Air Nelson with the only option of purchasing the Q400 or low-houred secondhand Q300 types. In March 2010, Air New Zealand suspended the option for Air Nelson to take up purchase rights of the higher speed 70-seat Q400, fearing an interservice rivalry with the slower but more economical ATR 72s of Mount Cook Airline. Air Nelson had hoped to pioneer a long distance turboprop service connecting Invercargill - Auckland or Rotorua - Queenstown nonstop as the economical high-speed Q400 would have allowed. Air New Zealand is now standardising on the ATR turboprop family and although the Q300 fleet is barely ten years old, Air Nelson has been advised to prepare for a change in fleet to the ATR 42 family. The transfer of heavy maintenance for Mount Cook Airline's ATR 72-500 and 600 fleet from Christchurch to Air Nelson's new facilities at Nelson Airport has been seen as a prelude to this policy.  "

wikipedia-2315859," Bruno Coulais  Bruno Coulais (born 13 January 1954) is a French composer, most widely known for his music on film soundtracks. Some of his better-known scores are those of ""Les choristes"", ""Coraline"", and ""The Secret of Kells"". Life and career. Coulais was born in Paris; his father is from Vendée and his mother was born in Paris. Coulais began his musical education on the violin and piano, aiming to become a composer of contemporary classical music. However, a series of acquaintances gradually re-oriented him towards film music. Coulais met François Reichenbach, who asked him in 1977 to sonorize his documentary ""México mágico"" and the producer Marie Bodin who permit to compose the first soundtracks for Jacques Davila. Until the end of the 1990s, he remained low-profile, composing mainly for television. His name can often be found from TV films by Gérard Marx and Laurent Heynemann. He also composed the soundtracks for Christine Pascal's 1992 film ""Le petit prince a dit"", and Agnès Merlet's ""Le fils du requin"" in 1993. In 1994, he met the television producer Josée Dayan, who let him write a theme for the TV series ""La rivière esperance"", aired on the France 2 network in autumn 1995. He worked with Dayan again with other major productions such as ""Le Comte de Monte-Cristo"", ""Balzac"", and ""Les nuiteux"". The largest turning point of his career came in 1996, when he worked with directors Claude Nuridsany and Marie Pérennou of the documentary ""Microcosmos"". This single film, which gave a great significance to the music in it, was a great success and made Coulais one of the most wanted composers of French film music. In 1997, he won the ""César"" award for the best musical score in a film, as well as a ""Victoire de la Musique"". His reputation was confirmed by the soundtracks to ""Himalaya"" (1999) and ""Les rivières pourpres"" (2000), and after that Bruno Coulais's name was to be found on most new French blockbusters, such as ""Belphégor"" and ""Vidocq"". After producing the soundtrack to ""Winged Migration"" in 2001, Coulais announced that he wanted to significantly reduce his contributions to film music, and instead concentrate on other projects, such as the creation of an opera for children, and collaborations with Akhenaton, Akhenaton's group IAM and the Corsican group A Filetta, with whom he had worked since he had made the soundtrack for Jacques Weber's film ""Don Juan"" in 1998. In 2002, his name was found on the ending credits of the animation ""L'enfant qui voulait être un ours"", and in 2004, on Frédéric Schoendoerffer's ""Agents secrets"". The same year, he wrote the soundtrack to the film ""Les choristes"" by Christophe Barratier, which subsequently became an international hit. The music for this film received as great praise as the film itself, and it won Coulais his third ""César"" award. Since then, Coulais's collaborations in cinema seem to be limited to works by directors with whom he already shares some history, in particular Jacques Perrin, Frédéric Schoendoerffer, and James Huth. In 2009, he won the 37th Annie Awards in the ""Music in a Feature Production"" category for ""Coraline"". In 2009 he also collaborated with Irish band Kíla to produce the soundtrack for the animated feature film ""The Secret of Kells"". Bruno Coulais's musical style may vary significantly between different projects, but there are some constant factors visible: his taste for opera and for human voice (in particular that of children), for a search for original sonority, for world music and for mixing different musical cultures.

wikipedia-2315912," Lila Lee  Lila Lee (July 25, 1901 – November 13, 1973) was a prominent screen actress of the early silent film era. Early life. Lila Lee was born Augusta Wilhelmena Fredericka Appel in Union Hill, New Jersey (now part of Union City) into a middle-class family of German immigrants who relocated to New York City when Lila was quite young. Searching for a hobby for their gregarious young daughter, the Appels enrolled Lila in Gus Edwards' kiddie review shows where she was given the nickname of ""Cuddles""; a name that she would be known by for the rest of her acting career. Her stagework became so popular with the public that her parents had her educated with private tutors. Edwards would become Lee's long-term manager. Career. In 1918, she was chosen for a film contract by Hollywood film mogul Jesse Lasky for Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, which later became Paramount Pictures. Her first feature ""The Cruise of the Make-Believes"" garnered the seventeen-year-old starlet much public acclaim and Lasky quickly sent Lee on an arduous publicity campaign. Critics lauded Lila for her wholesome persona and sympathetic character parts. Lee quickly rose to the ranks of leading lady and often starred opposite such matinee heavies as Conrad Nagel, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Reid, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, and Rudolph Valentino. In 1922 Lee was cast as ""Carmen"" in the enormously popular film ""Blood and Sand"", opposite matinee idol Rudolph Valentino and silent screen vamp Nita Naldi; Lee subsequently won the first WAMPAS Baby Stars award that year. Lee continued to be a highly popular leading lady throughout the 1920s and made scores of critically praised and widely watched films. As the ""Roaring Twenties"" drew to a close, Lee's popularity began to wane and Lee positioned herself for the transition to talkies. She is one of the few leading ladies of the silent screen whose popularity did not nosedive with the coming of sound. She went back to working with the major studios and appeared, most notably, in ""The Unholy Three"", in 1930, opposite Lon Chaney Sr. in his only talkie. However, a series of bad career choices and bouts of recurring tuberculosis and alcoholism hindered further projects and Lee was relegated to taking parts in mostly grade B-movies. Personal life. Lila was married and divorced three times. Her first husband was actor James Kirkwood, Sr., whom she married in 1923. The marriage ended in August 1931 on grounds of her desertion. Lee and Kirkwood had a son in 1924, James Kirkwood, Jr., whose custody was granted to his father; he became a highly regarded playwright and screenwriter whose works include ""A Chorus Line"" and ""P.S. Your Cat Is Dead"". Her second husband was broker Jack R. Peine (married 1934, divorced 1935) and her third husband was broker John E. Murphy (married 1944, divorced 1949). According to author Sean Egan in the James Kirkwood biography P""onies & Rainbows"", Murphy’s will left Lee at the financial mercy of his widow (married subsequent to Lee), who consequently became the manipulative character Aunt Claire in ""P.S. Your Cat Is Dead"". Lee made several uneventful appearances in stage plays in the 1940s, and starred in early television soap operas in the 1950s. In 1973 Lee died of a stroke at Saranac Lake, New York. For her contribution as an actress in motion pictures, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1716 Vine Street, in Hollywood, California. "

wikipedia-2315945," Gentex  Gentex Corporation () manufactures automatic-dimming rear-view mirrors and camera-based driver assistance systems to the global automotive industry. The company also provides commercial smoke alarms and signaling devices to the North American fire protection market, as well as dimmable aircraft windows for the commercial, business and general aviation markets. The company is based in Zeeland, Michigan and was founded in 1974. Their mirrors use electrochromism to dim in proportion to the amount of light reaching them from following vehicles' headlamps. The mirrors are available with added electronic features. About 98 percent of the company's net sales are derived from the sale of auto-dimming mirrors to every major automaker in the world. Fire protection. Gentex was founded in 1974 by Fred Bauer as a manufacturer of fire protection products. The company created the first dual-sensor photoelectric smoke detector, considered to be less prone to false alarms, while still quickly detecting smoldering fires. In the early 1990s, Gentex introduced a smoke detector equipped with a strobe light designed to alert the deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Today, Gentex manufactures a complete line of photoelectric detectors for fire alarm systems, standalone, and interconnect systems. Gentex also manufactures its Commander series horn/strobes, along with other notification appliances including speaker/strobes, mini-horns, bells, and weatherproof devices. Automotive. Automatic interior mirror. Gentex first introduced a rear-view mirror that automatically adjusted to glare conditions in 1982. Auto-dimming mirrors. Interior. Gentex introduced an automatic dimming mirror based on electrochromism in 1987. The reduction of glare eliminates the temporary blind spot caused by the Troxler effect after the glare source leaves the field of view. These mirrors have forward- and rearward-facing sensors to measure the ambient light level and glare of approaching vehicles, respectively. An electrochromic gel is placed between two pieces of glass, which allows the mirror to dim in proportion to the glare level. Exterior. In 1991, exterior electrochromic mirrors were added to the Gentex product line. These mirrors operate on the same principle as the interior mirrors. Different mirror geometries were added in 1997 to accomplish various tasks, such as eliminating blind spots and offering an expanded field of view. Aerospace. Gentex signed a contract through PPG Aerospace to deliver automatic dimming windows for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. These windows will use electrochromics to adjust the amount of light allowed through the window. "

wikipedia-2315985," SimplexGrinnell  SimplexGrinnell, a subsidiary of Tyco International, is an American company specializing in active fire protection systems, communication systems and testing, inspection and maintenance services. The company headquarters is in Boca Raton, Florida; corporate sales and marketing offices are in Westminster, Massachusetts, and the company has about 160 district offices throughout North America. Grinnell Fire Protection was purchased by Tyco in 1976. Tyco bought Simplex Time Recorder Company on January 5, 2001 for US$1.15 billion and merged it with Grinnell Fire Protection, forming SimplexGrinnell. It is currently the largest fire protection company in the world. Corporate history. Grinnell Fire Protection Company. Frederick Grinnell, a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, worked in railroad engineering until he retired as chief mechanical engineer and general manager of the Jersey City Locomotive Works. Soon after his retirement, he purchased a controlling interest in the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company.  Grinnell already knew Henry S. Parmalee, who patented the first automatic fire sprinkler head in 1874. Providence Steam & Gas partnered with Parmalee and manufactured the Parmalee sprinkler; Grinnell also designed and erected the piping installations into which the Parmalee sprinkler heads were fitted. Grinnell improved Parmalee's first practical automatic sprinkler and patented his own Grinnell sprinkler in 1882. Continual improvements resulted in the glass disc sprinkler in 1890. With slight modifications, this sprinkler head is still used in modern fire sprinkler systems; sprinklers are even called ""le Grinnells"" in France. In 1892, Grinnell organized the General Fire Extinguisher Company, which was renamed the Grinnell Fire Protection Company after his death in 1919. Simplex Time Recorder Company. Meanwhile, Edward G. Watkins founded the Simplex Time Recorder Company in 1894. Watkins invented and patented one of the first practical time clocks, along with the synchronized clock systems seen in schools up until recent times. The company, located in Gardner, Massachusetts, purchased the IBM Time Equipment Division in 1958. This purchase included IBM's fire protection division. Originally, Simplex's fire alarm line simply consisted of relabeled IBM devices and control panels (including the 4217 and possibly the 4201 series), but they began to introduce their own products starting in the early 1960s, including the 4245, 4246, and 4247 series control panels. Most of Simplex's audible notification appliances prior to the 1990s were relabeled Benjamin Electric, Federal Signal, Faraday, and Autocall devices. Simplex's time division began to lose market share, but their newly-founded fire alarm division significantly prospered. Simplex's 4040 vibrating horns have been noted as the loudest fire alarm audible signal to be produced in America, reaching up to 120dB in some cases. In the early 1970s, Simplex introduced the 4208-series conventional control panels. The 4050-80 series was introduced in 1973. Around this time, Simplex also introduced the iconic ""T-bar"" style pull station, which is still manufactured today. In the mid 1970s, Simplex introduced the 4207, a system similar in design to the 4208, but with updated features such as card-based modularity, DC battery trickle charging, and voice evacuation for large buildings.  In 1979, Simplex introduced the LifeAlarm 2100, the industry's first networked multiplex building control system that was capable of handling fire alarm, security, HVAC, synchronized time, and watchman's tour. It centered around a large CPU console with built-in CRT display and keyboard that controlled the system's remote transponders (smaller self-sufficient panels connected to the MAPNET loop that distributed the system's I/O). In 1981, the 2100 was replaced with the popular 2120-series. Unlike the 2100, the 2120's main CPU came in the form of a traditional wall-mount panel, but several more options for remotely controlling the system through external CRT consoles and status command centers were now made available. The main panel featured a vacuum fluorescent display screen, DOS-based EEPROM programming, built-in printer, and a voice evacuation option. Though flexible and robust, these systems were often criticized for being difficult to operate and troubleshoot. These two computer-based systems were accompanied by the conventional 2001-series. First released in 1979, the 2001 was a highly customizable system that used plug-in modules. Some were common to every system (basic controls), while many other options were available, including signal coding cards, waterflow monitor cards, and many others. These cards were also compatible with Simplex's multiplex systems. In 1986, the 2001 was replaced by the 4001 and 4002 series, and the 1000-point 4100 addressable system was introduced two years later. Around 1992, the 2120 was replaced with the 4120-series networked panel, and the 508-point 4020 addressable system was introduced at the same time. In 1993, Simplex began manufacturing their own notification appliances, and in 2001, Simplex introduced the TrueAlert-series, cited as being the industry's first addressable notification appliances which can be tested individually without activating the entire system. The 4100U, a consolidated upgrade of Simplex's three largest addressable systems, followed in 2002, and was again updated in 2010 with the current 4100ES. From time to time, SimplexGrinnell has used Cooper Wheelock, Gentex and Federal Signal notification appliances, mostly for outdoor/weatherproof applications. However, this is becoming less frequent with the introduction of weatherproof TrueAlert signals. Current products and services. Fire alarm systems. Today, SimplexGrinnell markets a full product line of conventional and addressable fire alarm and emergency notification systems, including: Simplex fire alarm systems are compatible with TrueAlert-series notification appliances, TrueAlarm smoke detectors, 4009-series IDNet NAC extenders, the 4003EC voice/alarm communications panel, and a variety of accessories. Other products. SimplexGrinnell also markets burglar alarms, PA systems, and nurse call systems. They also provide testing, inspection, and maintenance services for fire alarm, sprinkler, suppression, security, and communication equipment. To a much lesser degree, the company also sells and services time clocks and master time systems. "

wikipedia-2316015," Stunning  Stunning is the process of rendering animals immobile or unconscious, without killing the animal, prior to their being slaughtered for food. History. This process has been common for centuries in the case of cattle, which were poleaxed prior to being bled out. In the United Kingdom and Europe more widely the development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. Prior to humane slaughter pistols and electric stunners, pigs, sheep and other animals (including cattle) were simply struck while fully conscious. The belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal being slaughtered led to the compulsory adoption of stunning methods in many countries. The Humane Slaughter Act of 1933 in Britain, for example, was specifically conceived not only to make stunning compulsory, but moreover to make modern methods, such as the captive bolt pistol and electric tongs, the means by which it was achieved. The wording of the 1933 act specifically outlaws the poleaxe. The period is marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long-lasting. United States regulation. Stunning is regulated by the provisions of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (7 U.S.C. 1901), which the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is mandated to uphold under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603 (b)). No similar provision exists in the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.). After confirmation of the first U.S. BSE case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting the use of the most widely used stunning device (air-injection captive bolt stun gun) because the compressed air (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating captive bolt) has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream. Cattle blood is processed primarily for use as a protein supplement in animal feeds and milk replacer for calves, and could potentially transmit BSE if it contained specified risk materials (SRMs include brain and CNS tissue). Modern methods. In modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include: Electrical stunning. Electrical stunning is done by sending an electrical current through the brain and/or heart of the animal before slaughter. Current passing through the brain induces an immediate but non-fatal general convulsion that produces unconsciousness. Current passing through the heart produces an immediate cardiac arrest that also leads shortly to unconsciousness and death. It is a controversial subject however. With chickens for example, overstunning leads to bone fractures and/or electrocution which prevents bleeding of the animal. This negatively affects the quality of the meat, and therefore understunning is an attractive practice for slaughterhouses. In the Netherlands, for example, the law states that poultry must be stunned for 4 seconds minimum with an average current of 100 mA, which leads to systematic understunning. The CrustaStun is a device designed to administer a lethal electric shock to shellfish (such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish) before cooking. This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates. The device works by applying a 110 volt, 2–5 amp electrical charge to the animal. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab. Gas stunning. With gas stunning animals are exposed to a mixture of breathing gases (carbon dioxide for example, but historically carbon monoxide was used) that produce unconsciousness or death through hypoxia or asphyxia. The process is not instantaneous. Percussive stunning. With percussive stunning, a device which hits the animal on the head, with or without penetration, is employed. Such devices, such as the captive bolt pistol, can be either pneumatic, or powder-actuated. Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma. "

wikipedia-2316032," Operations room  The Operations Room (also known as Combat Information Center or under the British system, Action Information Centre) is the tactical center of a warship or AWAC aircraft providing processed information for command and control of the near battle space or 'area of operations'. Within other military commands, rooms serving similar functions are called by the similar ""Command Information Center"" or simply ""Command Center""; the number of different terms for spaces that serve much the same function may explain why the plain and generally non-descriptive ""Operations Center"" is a prevalent term. Regardless of the vessel or command locus, each CIC organizes and processes information into a form more convenient and usable by the commander in authority. Each CIC funnels communications and data received over multiple channels, which is then organized, evaluated, weighted and arranged to provide ordered timely information flow to the battle command staff under the control of the CIC officer and his deputies.  Operations Rooms are widely depicted in film and television treatments, frequently with large maps, numerous computer consoles and radar and sonar repeater displays or consoles, as well as the almost ubiquitous grease-pencil annotated polar plot on an edge-lighted transparent plotting board. At the time the CIC concept was born, the projected map-like polar display (PPI scopes) with the ship at the center was making its way into radar displays displacing the A-scope which was simply a time-delayed blip showing a range on an oscilloscope Cathode Ray Tube. Such polar plots are used routinely in navigation and military action management to display time-stamped range and bearing information to the CIC decision makers. A single 'mark' (""range and bearing"" datum) bears little actionable decision-making information by itself. A succession of such data tells much more, including whether the contact is closing or opening in range, an idea of its speed and direction (these are calculable, even from bearings-only data, given sufficient observations and knowledge of tactics), the relation to other contacts and their ranges and behaviors. Harvesting such data sets from the polar plots and computers (Common to sonar, radar and lidar) allows the CIC crew to plot the data correctly on a chart or map at the correct range and bearing, and to calculate the course and speed of the contact accurately, giving the set a vast expansion to include future positions, given unchanged relative courses and relative speeds.  The ""Operations Room"" in the naval context brings together and manages information on the warship's status, its surroundings and supplies this to the commanding officer, who would generally be present on the nearby bridge or where plots can be viewed and, if one is aboard, a flag officer who might have their own separate ""flag bridge"" and Fleet CIC. The 'Operations Room' or 'Operations Center' in other command contexts has the same function, information ordering, gathering, and presentation to the decision makers whether it is to a prime minister, general or local police chief. The types and controls over the collection of information, the communications systems may vary, but the task or mission of providing clarification of the situation and options to the commander remain the same whether the Ops Center is located on a submarine, surface ship or airplane. Some control, assistance, and coordination functions may be delegated to the operations room staff or directly to the CIC officer, such as overseeing the mode and prioritization of sensor resources such as radar monitoring, targeting, or sonar activities; communications to external sources and assets. CIC is sometimes referred to by Operations Specialists as ""Christ I'm Confused"". On US aircraft carriers this area is called the combat direction center (CDC). The United States developed their Command Information Center concept circa the winter of 1942–1943 and implemented it in a surge of refitting and retraining during 1943 after post-battle action analyses of battles in 1942 from the battle of the Coral Sea through the losses at Ironbottom Sound during the protracted Solomon Islands campaign. In British usage this area may be known as an Aircraft Direction Room; together with the Operations Room they form an ""Operations Headquarters"". The British Aircraft Direction Room evolved from the Fighter Direction Office, a primitive means of controlling an aircraft carrier's aircraft through radio and radar. Development. The idea of such a centralised control room is surprisingly old; it can be found in science fiction as early as The Struggle For Empire (1900). Early versions were used in the second world war; according to Rear Admiral Cal Laning, the idea for a command information center was taken “specifically, consciously, and directly” from the spaceship Directrix in the Lensman novels of E.E. Smith, Ph.D., and influenced by the works of his friend and collaborator Robert Heinlein, a retired American naval officer. After the numerous losses during the various naval battles off Guadalcanal during the war of attrition that was part and parcel of the Solomon Islands campaign and the Battle of Guadalcanal the United States Navy employed Operational analysis, determined many of their losses were due to procedure and disorganization, and implemented the Combat Information Centers building on what was initially called ""radar plot"" according to an essay ""CIC Yesterday and Today"" by the Naval Historical Center. That same article points out that in 1942 radar, radar procedure, battle experiences, needs, and the CIC all grew up together as needs developed and experience was gained and training spread, all in fits and starts beginning with the earliest radar uses in the Pacific battles starting with the Coral Sea, when radar gave rise to the first tentative attempt to vector an Air CAP to approaching Japanese flights, maturing some before the Battle of Midway, where post-battle analysis of Coral Sea's results had given more confidence in the ability and to the process and the desire was bolstered by new procedures giving their measure of added confidence.  The Naval Historical Center essay notes that growing the responsibility of the nascent CIC organization necessarily upset the old order of doing, who was reporting to whom, and most of all, of communications protocols where now CIC's within a task group were when possible joined in permanent communication links to even the lowliest destroyer escort or fleet auxiliary, adding the eyes and reports of their lookouts to those of similar watch-standers about the fleet as a whole. In short the CIC's continually grew for a time superseding old organizational structure and supplanting them with a new system filtering and shaping information to a newly empowered command group. The tasks and facilities put at the service of the CIC's also grew within a ship. While in 1943 a Destroyer CIC might just have been configured for Anti-ship and Anti-submarine warfare tasks, by the Battle of the Philippine Sea when set out as radar pickets had to undertake forward air controller (FAC) functions and somehow jam in air search radar and anti-air action control functions. From that beginning, were added the corporate experiences of the continuing series of naval air and naval surface actions around and about the Battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands campaign. By late 1943 when the first new construction carriers of the Essex class fleet carriers and the Independence class Light carriers with many associated fleet vessels had reinforced the refitted USS Enterprise (CV-6) and the USS Saratoga (CV-3), the U.S. Navy was prepared to take the offensive and began evolving CIC procedures and operational doctrine for a fleet of carriers.  There has been an evolution of electronics (computer) equipment and user interfaces used in such installations over time. Modern Operations Room equipment is built up from many connected embedded systems. External links. US Navy Surface Warfare Officer School - Division Officer Training "

wikipedia-2316077," Central Link  Central Link is a light rail line running between downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It is the initial phase of Sound Transit's Link Light Rail system. Service operates seven days a week, from 5 am to 1 am Monday through Saturday and from 6 am to midnight on Sundays. Trains are composed of two cars, each with a capacity of 200 passengers—74 seated and 126 standing. Opened on July 18, 2009, Central Link initially operated between downtown Seattle and Tukwila, on a route. Service was extended by from Tukwila to SeaTac Airport on December 19, 2009. Routing. The northern terminus is at Westlake Station near the intersection of Pine Street and 4th Avenue. Central Link trains operate inside the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, sharing the right-of-way with diesel-electric hybrid buses. The route serves four of the tunnel's five stations (Convention Place Station being the exception). After exiting the southern end of the tunnel at International District/Chinatown Station, the route joins the SoDo Busway (formerly 5th Avenue S.) as a traffic-separated surface route, where it has priority for all intersections. The route serves two stations on the busway and then rises to an elevated section through the SoDo neighborhood. The route then enters the Beacon Hill Tunnel under Beacon Hill and makes one stop at the underground Beacon Hill Station. Exiting the tunnel, the route becomes grade-separated on an elevated bridge. It serves Mount Baker Station near Franklin High School before it becomes an at-grade surface route on Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. and serves three stations in the Rainier Valley. Continuing south on Martin Luther King Jr. Way S., it again becomes grade-separated on an elevated guideway and runs alongside Boeing Access Road, E. Marginal Way S., Interurban Avenue S., SR 599, and I-5. Just north of SR 518, the route turns west and parallels SR 518. It stops at Tukwila International Boulevard Station before crossing International Boulevard and running in the center of the North Airport Expressway all the way to the southern terminus of SeaTac/Airport Station, an elevated station lying northeast of the parking garage, immediately west of International Boulevard. Fares. The fares for Link are distance-based: $2.00 base fare plus 5 cents per mile, rounded to the nearest 25 cents. The maximum cost of a one-way ticket is $2.75, for a trip between Downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport. Adult fares for Link are as follows: Seniors (65+) and the disabled may obtain a permit allowing them to ride for a reduced flat fare of $0.75 per trip. Youth (6–18) can ride for a flat fare of $1.25 per trip. Transfers. Users of the ORCA Card have their transfer fares calculated automatically. Users of cash and paper tickets can't obtain transfer credit. Their tickets are valid for one ride only unless a Link Round Trip Ticket is purchased, which allows unlimited travel between the stations on the ticket for that service day. Central Link to Bus or Vice Versa Only ORCA Cards can be used without having to pay another fare between Central Link and buses in the following agencies: ST Express, King County Metro, Community Transit or Pierce Transit. Headways. Central Link operates on the following schedule: Travel Times. The vehicles operates with an end-to-end travel time of 36 minutes over the route between Westlake and SeaTac/Airport. Travel times are as follows; all times measured in minutes. The 36-minute travel time from Westlake Station to SeaTac/Airport Station was similar to the 32-minute scheduled travel time of the now cancelled King County Metro Route 194 bus from Convention Place Station to the airport. Wait times are shorter and access is better, as light rail runs more frequently and during more hours of the day than Route 194 did, and serves more stops between downtown and the airport. Since light rail operates on its own right of way, it is not subject to delays due to traffic congestion. King County Metro discontinued route 194 on February 6, 2010. Riders who boarded Route 194 at the Kent/Des Moines or Star Lake (272nd) freeway stations and are destined north of the airport now have to board ST Route 574 and transfer to light rail at SeaTac/Airport Station. Expanded service on Sound Transit routes 577 and 578 now provide a direct connection between the Federal Way Transit Center and Downtown Seattle. Unlike the former route 194, routes 577 and 578 do not serve the Federal Way Park & Ride, but shorten the trip between Downtown and Federal Way by 26 minutes. Ridership. Ridership has significantly risen since the line opened in July 2009 and saw 12,000 boardings per weekday. The completion of the line to its ultimate destination, the airport, subsequent passengers from closing Route 194, and shifting of bus routes to feed into the light rail contributed to the increase. Average weekday ridership reached 21,774 by May 2010 and 32,000 by June 2013.  Sound Transit measures ridership by using the infrared sensors built into the doorways. Equipment. Kinkisharyo-Mitsui was chosen to design and manufacture low-floor light rail vehicles (LRVs) and provide additional equipment and support. Thirty-five light rail cars were delivered between November 2006 and September 2008. Each vehicle is long, wide, accommodate 200 people each (74 seated), and double-ended to allow travel in either direction. Two-car trains will be used initially, but as ridership increases, trains can be up to four cars long. Until University Link construction is completed, only three-car trains can be used, due to the length of the stub tracks at the north end interlocking. The maximum speed of the light rail vehicle is . An additional 27 LRVs have been delivered to Sound Transit by Kinkisharyo at a rate of one a month, beginning in August 2010. The overhead catenary that supplies electricity to the LRVs is fed (from substations) at 1,500 Volts DC, a departure from the normal voltage for U.S. light rail systems, 750V, with Central Link being the first light rail system in North America to use 1,500V. Sound Transit's other light rail line, the 2003-opened Tacoma Link, uses 750V. "

wikipedia-2316124," Cheese sandwich  A cheese sandwich is a basic sandwich made generally with one or more varieties of cheese on any sort of bread. In addition to the cheese, it may also include meats, vegetables and/or condiments. Cheese sandwiches can be uncooked, or heated so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts (a dish referred to as a grilled cheese sandwich, toasted cheese, cheese toastie or simply grilled cheese). Cheese sandwiches with added meat (such as ham, bacon, turkey and other meats) are generally referred to by more specific names. If ham is included, for example, the result is a ""ham and cheese sandwich"". History. Cooked bread and cheese is an ancient food, according to food historians, popular across the world in many cultures; evidence indicates that in the U.S., the modern version of the grilled cheese sandwich originated in the 1920s when inexpensive sliced bread and American cheese became easily available. The cheese dream became popular during the Great Depression. It was originally made as an open sandwich, but the top slice of bread became common by the 1960s. U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling ""American cheese filling sandwiches"" during World War II. Many versions of the grilled cheese sandwich can now be found on restaurant menus across the United States. According to ""Woman's Day"", April is ""Grilled Cheese Sandwich Month"". Preparation. Uncooked cheese sandwiches simply require assembly of the cheese slices on the bread, along with any additions and condiments. A grilled cheese sandwich is assembled and then heated until the bread crisps and the cheese melts, sometimes combined with an additional ingredient such as peppers, tomatoes or onions. Several different methods of heating the sandwich are used, depending on the region and personal preference. Common methods include being cooked on a griddle, grilled, fried in a pan or made in a panini grill or sandwich toaster (this method is more common in the United Kingdom where the sandwiches are normally called ""toasted sandwiches"" or ""toasties""). When making grilled cheese on an open griddle or pan, one side is cooked first, then the sandwich is flipped and cooked on the other side. The sandwich is finished when both sides are toasted and the cheese has melted. Butter, oil, or mayonnaise may first be spread on either the bread or the cooking surface in the case of butter and oil. An alternative technique is to toast or grill each half of the sandwich separately, then combine them. Another method sometimes referred as an ""inside out"" grilled cheese has an extra layer of cheese put on the outside of each side and cooked, causing the cheese to caramelize into a crispy outer layer.  When using butter best results are achieved at a medium heat. This prevents the milk solids in butter from burning and allows sufficient time for heat to thoroughly penetrate the sandwich and melt the cheese without burning the bread. A crispy golden-brown crust with a melted cheese center is a commonly preferred level of preparedness. Cooking times can vary depending on pan dimensions, ability to control the intensity of the heat source, bread type, cheese variety and overall thickness of pre-cooked sandwich. "

wikipedia-2316134," Ithaca 37  The Ithaca 37 is a pump-action shotgun made in large numbers for the civilian, military, and police markets. It utilizes a novel combination ejection/loading port on the bottom of the gun which leaves the sides closed to the elements. In addition, the outline of the gun is clean. Finally, since shells load and eject from the bottom, operation of the gun is equally convenient for both right and left hand shooters. This makes the gun popular with left-handed shooters. History. The Ithaca 37 is based on a 1915 design by the famous firearms designers John Browning and John Pedersen, initially marketed as the Remington Model 17. The Model 17 was a 20-gauge of trim proportions, which Browning and Pedersen later redesigned and refined into the popular side-ejecting Remington Model 31. That gun would eventually be replaced in production by the less expensive Remington 870 which is still produced to this day. Following the First World War, the Ithaca Gun Company was searching for a pump-action shotgun to produce, primarily to compete with the ubiquitous Winchester Model 1912. They settled on waiting for Remington Model 17 patents to expire. After gearing for production of the Ithaca Model 33, they discovered more Pedersen patents that would not expire until 1937; along with the introduction date, they changed the model designation from 33 to 37. With the depression dragging on and war looming on the horizon, it was possibly the worst time to introduce a sporting arm. Many sporting arms ceased production entirely during the same period. While Ithaca did produce some shotguns for military use during the war, they also produced M1911 pistols and M3 Grease Guns. After WW-II, Ithaca resumed production of the Model 37. Made in many different models, the Ithaca 37 has the longest production run for a pump-action shotgun in history, surpassing that of the Winchester Model 12 that had originally inspired Ithaca to produce pump-action shotguns. Ithaca has suffered many setbacks in its history, changing hands numerous times. At one time, the Ithaca 37 was renamed the Model 87, although it was soon changed back in one of many ownership changes. Production paused in 2005 when Ithaca once again changed hands. Production has resumed in Ohio. Users. The largest single user outside the US Military is the Los Angeles Police Department. Along with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, numerous other users include military, police, security agencies, and prisons. The Ithaca 37 was a popular choice among civilians for both sport and personal protection. With higher prices for new Ithacas and decreasing availability compared to the Mossberg 500 and Remington 870, use of the Ithaca 37 continues to decline. Interestingly, Ithaca's loss of market share was hastened by competition from a copy of the shotgun. Chinese copies of the Ithaca 37 have been imported recently. Additionally, the supply of used civilian and departmental shotguns has been a steady competitor. Operation. Loading the Ithaca 37 involves inserting shells of the proper gauge through the loading/ejection port and pushing them forward into the magazine until retained by the shell stop. The slide release is pressed and the slide retracted completely then pushed forward. Pulling the trigger fires the gun and releases the slide for reloading. On most models, holding the trigger down allows the gun to fire the instant a new round is cycled into the chamber without requiring the trigger to be released, a process known as slamfire. Otherwise, the model 37 operates in much the same way as other pump-action shotguns. Versions. There are versions too numerous to mention. Here are some popular models: Argentine variants. The Argentine firm Industrias Marcati manufactured the Ithaca 37 under licence as the Bataan Modelo 71. Browning versions. Browning Arms also started to manufacturing its own version called BPS (Browning Pump Shotgun) in 1977. Browning started with 12 gauge only, but BPS now come in 10, 16, 20, 28 and .410 as well as 12.

Cross created, wrote, executive produced, and starred in ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret""; developed and had a prominent role in the Comedy Central animated sitcom ""Freak Show""; and has a recurring role in the ABC sitcom ""Modern Family"". Early life. Cross was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Susi and Barry who emigrated from Leeds, England. Six months after his birth, Cross's family moved to Florida. After additional moves to New York and Connecticut, the family settled back in Roswell, Georgia, where Cross remained for nearly a decade. His family was poor and Barry left the family when Cross was ten years old, and Cross and Barry have not spoken since he was 19, though they both primarily resided in New York City until Cross sold his home there in 2011. Cross and his family were evicted from their home while living in Georgia. He spent some time living in motels and at friends' homes while growing up. He has two sisters, and once bailed his youngest sibling out of jail.  Career. Beginnings in comedy. Cross began performing stand-up comedy at 17. The day after he graduated from high school, Cross went to New York. Lacking a plan, he drifted around, working briefly for a lawn care company on Long Island, and later enrolled at Emerson College in Boston. He would drop out after only a semester, but during his time there, Cross joined This is Pathetic, a college sketch group, where he met John Ennis. In the summer of 1985, the two aspiring actors took a road trip to Los Angeles, although this did not significantly further their acting careers. In Boston, Cross began to perform stand-up more regularly. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, Boston had a booming comedy scene, although Cross did not fit the types of acts being booked most of the time. He recalls that it was ""a loud-, dumb-, pandering-, racist-, homophobic-type scene"". In 1990, a new comedy scene began to emerge at the famous comedy club chain called Catch a Rising Star (where many of the comedians of the 1970s and 1980s got their start). Cross—along with Janeane Garofalo, Louis C.K., and other comics—appeared regularly several nights a week. Cross formed the sketch comedy group ""Cross Comedy"" with twelve other performers, and they put on a new show every week. They were known for playing tricks on the audience, such as introducing fake comics or planting fake hecklers. Cross became increasingly focused on his comedy work. Cross performed at the alternative comedy club Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. Cross continues to perform stand-up, in which he blends political commentary and satire. In 1999, he was given his own one-hour comedy special on HBO, entitled ""The Pride Is Back"". He has released three recordings, ""Shut Up You Fucking Baby!"", ""It's Not Funny"", and ""Bigger and Blackerer"". Cross' stand up material was featured in Comedy Central's animated series Shorties Watchin' Shorties. In 2004, ""Shut Up You Fucking Baby!"" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. In 2003, he released his first tour film, ""Let America Laugh"", and was named #85 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time. He appears on Un-Cabaret compilation albums, including ""Freak Weather Feels Different"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Drugly"". Work on ""The Ben Stiller Show"", ""Mr. Show"" and other programs. Cross began his professional television career as a writer on ""The Ben Stiller Show"". The short-lived Fox Network series hired him toward the end of its run, and he occasionally made brief appearances in the sketches. He had a speaking role in ""The Legend of T.J. O'Pootertoot"", a sketch written almost entirely by Cross. It was during this period that he first met Bob Odenkirk, with whom he would later co-create the HBO sketch comedy series ""Mr. Show"" in 1995. Cross won an Emmy for his work on ""The Ben Stiller Show"" in 1993. Cross later co-starred as Tobias Fünke in ""Arrested Development"", which was originally intended to be only a minor role. He has also played smaller roles on programs such as ""Just Shoot Me!"", ""The Drew Carey Show"", ""NewsRadio"", ""Strangers with Candy"","" Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job"", and ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"". Since October 2005, Cross has appeared on Comedy Central's ""The Colbert Report"" as Stephen Colbert's arch-nemesis, a fictional liberal radio talk show host from Madison, Wisconsin named ""Russ Lieber"". Cross also developed an animated series for Comedy Central called ""Freak Show"", which co-starred H. Jon Benjamin, and was cancelled due to low ratings. He has appeared several times on the MTV2 series ""Wonder Showzen"". Cross teamed up with ""Mr. Show"" Producer/Director Troy Miller and Odenkirk to produce a feature film ""Run Ronnie Run"", based on one of their ""Mr. Show"" characters. The film satirized the reality television craze, and featured cameos from many stars; however, Odenkirk got into conflict with the studio New Line Cinema, and they then released it direct-to-video. In 1994 and again in 1999, Cross was a guest voice actor on Joe Frank's radio show, featured in the episodes ""The Last Run"", ""A Hearing"", ""The O.J. Chronicles"", and ""Jam"". In 2013, he returned, making an appearance in an episode of Frank's radio show, entitled ""A Conversation."" In 2004, Cross provided voices for a Marine in the Xbox game ""Halo 2"", and a store clerk named in """". He also was the voice of the violent, alcoholic ""Happy-Time Harry"" doll and Bert Banana in ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" (although the part was credited as Sir Willups Brightslymoore). He has also made guest appearances in the Adult Swim series ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"". He directed the music video for The Black Keys' song ""10am Automatic"", a spoof of public-access television. Cross appeared in The Strokes' music video for ""Juicebox"" as a bad local ""morning zoo"" radio DJ. He also appeared in The New Pornographers' video for ""Use It"", in Superchunk's video for ""Watery Hands"" (along with Janeane Garofalo), and in Yo La Tengo's video for ""Sugarcube"" (along with Bob Odenkirk and John Ennis). Cross contributes to ""Vice"" magazine, writing a column titled ""My America"". In 2005, he contributed to the UNICEF benefit song ""Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?"" and appeared in one of PETA's ""I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"" campaigns. In the Beastie Boys' 2006 concert film ""Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!"", Cross played the character Nathaniel Hörnblowér in the fictional segment ""A Day in the Life of Nathaniel Hörnblowér"". In the Bob Dylan biographical film ""I'm Not There"", Cross played the role of poet Allen Ginsberg. Both Bill Lawrence and Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"" were eager to have Cross cameo on the show as Tobias Fünke, but because of the series' cancellation, the plan never came to fruition. Cross provided commentary on the ""Vicarious"" music video DVD for the band Tool. He has previously performed comedy as an opening act for the band, and its members appeared on ""Mr. Show"" several times. He played Ian Hawke in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", ' and ' and voiced Crane in the 2008 movie ""Kung Fu Panda"", a role which he has continued through most of the animated franchise. Cross starred in a pilot for HBO called ""David's Situation"" which filmed in May 2008 and included many ""Mr. Show"" alumni at the taping. On August 6, 2008, Bob Odenkirk announced on bobanddavid.com that ""David's Situation"" would not be produced. Cross' comedy series ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"", which he co-wrote with writer Shaun Pye, has run on Channel 4 in the UK and the cable channel IFC in the U.S. In 2009, Cross released his first book, I Drink for a Reason. The book features memoirs, satirical fictional memoirs and material from Cross that originally appeared in other publications. In September 2009, Cross performed at his own comedy stage at the ATP New York 2009 music festival, for which he picked Eugene Mirman, Jon Benjamin & Jon Glaser and Derrick Brown & The Navy Gravy to join him. In 2009 Cross, along with Jon Benjamin, created and wrote for ""Paid Programming"", a live action television pilot for Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim. ""Paid Programming"" was not picked up for a full series, and Benjamin referred to it as an ""abject failure"". On March 29, 2010 Cross's first comedy special in six years, ""Bigger and Blackerer"", was streamed on Epix HD. A CD with ""slightly different content"" was released on May 25, 2010. Cross starred alongside Julia Stiles and America Ferrera in the dark comedy ""It's a Disaster"", which premiered at the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival. Oscilloscope Laboratories has acquired the US distribution rights to the film, and plans to release it in select theaters starting April 13, 2013. Personal life. Although he was raised Jewish, Cross is now an atheist and does not practice Judaism. In August 2011, after two years of dating, Cross became engaged to actress Amber Tamblyn. The couple wed on October 6, 2012. On September 26, 2013, Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler revealed that Cross was the first investor in the crowdfunding platform. Strickler included Cross among the ""friends and family"" who first financed Kickstarter in 2006. Controversies. In October 2005, Cross was sued by Nashville club owner Thomas Weber, who accused Cross of taping him without permission for ""Shut Up You Fucking Baby"" and ""Let America Laugh"" in violation of Weber's privacy rights. In April 2006 the case against Cross himself was dismissed and the case proceeded with Warner Music, Subpop Records, WEA Corporation, and the Alternative Distribution Alliance. In a 2012 interview with ""Playboy"" magazine, Cross revealed that he had snorted a small amount of cocaine at the 2009 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Cross said, ""It wasn’t like I got high...It was just about being able to say that I did it, that I did cocaine in the same room as the president."" Criticisms. Larry the Cable Guy. In April 2005, Cross criticized stand-up comedian Larry the Cable Guy in a ""Rolling Stone"" interview, saying, ""It's a lot of anti-gay, racist humor—which people like in America—all couched in 'I'm telling it like it is.' He's in the right place at the right time for that gee-shucks, proud-to-be-a-redneck, I'm-just-a-straight-shooter-multimillionaire-in-cutoff-flannel-selling-ring-tones act. That's where we are as a nation now. We're in a state of vague American values and anti-intellectual pride."" In response, Larry devoted a chapter in his book ""GIT-R-DONE"" to Cross and the ""P.C. left"", claiming that Cross had ""screwed with my fans, it was time for me to say something"". Larry claimed that ""Rolling Stone"" was baiting comedians to attack him, and they turned to Cross only after Lewis Black refused (due to the fact that Larry and Lewis are good friends). Cross responded with ""An Open Letter to Larry the Cable Guy"" posted on his website. He continued to mock Larry in his stand-up, satirizing ""Blue Collar TV"" during a guest appearance on ""Wonder Showzen"". In December 2005, he ended his performance on Comedy Central's ""Last Laugh '05"" by mockingly yelling ""GIT-R-DONE!"" (Larry the Cable Guy's catchphrase) to the audience as he left the stage. He pokes fun at Larry's comedy in ""Freak Show"" with a character called ""Danny the Plumber Guy"". James Lipton. Cross has criticized ""Inside the Actors Studio"" host James Lipton on a ""Mr. Show"" sketch and in his stand-up performance ""The Pride Is Back"", calling him ""pretentious."" Lipton, who thought that Cross's impression of him was not good-natured, would later appear alongside Cross in ""Arrested Development"", in the recurring role of Prison Warden Stefan Gentles. During filming, Cross was impressed with Lipton's acting and comedic ability, and the two became good friends. On one commentary track for season four of ""Mr. Show"", Cross discussed the encounter, complimenting Lipton for his professionalism and performance, saying that he liked Lipton personally but still ""didn't care for"" ""Inside The Actors Studio"". ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"". Responding to critics of his decision to appear in the critically panned but commercially successful ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", Cross noted that the film paid for a summer home, and more than ""all my other projects combined: book, TV show, the two pilots, ""Year One"", yeah."" Although he has admitted to taking the role primarily for the money, he has said that he does not regret doing so or consider it to be ""selling out"" as he has nothing against entertainment designed for children to enjoy that does not send a bad message. Cross reprised his ""Chipmunks"" role in the film's . In 2011, Cross said that making ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked"", the third film, was, in contrast, ""the most unpleasant experience I've ever had in my professional life."" He stated that this was due to clashes with one particular producer involved in the movie that he would not name, though he specified that it was not anyone in the cast, nor the director, and later posted a note to his Facebook page clarifying that it was not executive producers Janice Karman or Ross Bagdasarian either, whom he stated ""were never anything but warm, giving, and gracious"" and regretted that some speculated they were the producers to whom he referred. "
wikipedia-2316267," Bernhard Crusell  Bernhard Henrik Crusell (15 October 1775 – 28 July 1838) was a Swedish-Finnish clarinetist, composer and translator, ""the most significant and internationally best-known Finnish-born classical composer and indeed, — the outstanding Finnish composer before Sibelius"". Early life and training. Crusell was born in Uusikaupunki (Swedish: Nystad), Finland, into a poor family of bookbinders. His grandfather, Bernhard Kruselius had learned the trade of bookbinding in Turku and Stockholm, then settled in Pori where he fathered nine children, including Crusell's father Jakob, who also became a bookbinder. In 1765, after Jakob completed his apprenticeship, he moved to Uusikaupunki and married Helena Ylander, but she died about one year later. In 1769 he married Margaretha Messman. The couple had four children, but Bernhard was the only one who lived to become an adult. Later in life Crusell described this period of his life, writing in the third person: In his little town of birth there was only one person who had an active interest in music: a shop assistant who could be heard in the evenings playing the flute for his own amusement. One night, the four-year old Berndt was sitting in the street, leaning against a wall, on top of the world with admiration for the sweet melodies. His parents, who had been looking for their son for a long time, scolded him severely, but this could not stop the boy from returning to his favourite spot the next evening. This time he got a beating for his disobedience, but as it was to no avail, they left him to his ""craze"", confident that he would come back home as soon as the flute went silent... When Crusell was eight, the family moved to Nurmijärvi about 23 miles north of Helsinki. His innate interest in music continued, and he learned to play a friend's clarinet by ear. He soon began to receive training from a member of the Nyland regimental band. In 1788, when he was thirteen, another family friend, aware of the young man's natural ability, took him to see Major O. Wallenstjerna at Sveaborg (). Sveaborg was a Swedish fortress built on six islands just off the coast of Helsinki. The educated officers of the fort had significant influence on the culture and politics of the city. Wallenstjerna, impressed with Crusell's playing, recruited him as a volunteer member of the Sveaborg military band and gave him a place to live with his own family. Crusell received an education at Sveaborg and excelled in music and languages. In 1791 Wallenstjerna transferred to Stockholm and Crusell went with him. Although Crusell spent most of the rest of his life in Sweden, he always considered himself a Finn. In his final years in a letter to Runeberg he called himself a ""finsk landsman"" (a Finn). He also maintained his travel diaries in Finnish. Career as a clarinetist. In Stockholm, Crusell continued his studies and established himself as a clarinet soloist. In 1792, at age sixteen, he received an appointment as the director of the regimental band, and in 1793 became principal clarinet with the ""Hovkapellet"" (Royal Court Orchestra), which was directed by his composition teacher, the German composer Abbé Vogler. In 1798 he received financial assistance which enabled him to live in Berlin for a few months and study with the well-known German clarinetist Franz Tausch (1762–1817). Tausch had founded the German school of clarinet playing which emphasized beauty of tone over technique. Crusell's progress was swift, and he performed at concerts in Berlin and Hamburg before returning to Sweden. The review of the Hamburg concert in ""Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung"" was positive. Crusell lived in Sweden for the rest of his life, going back to Finland only once. After a trip to St. Petersburg, on his return trip to Sweden, he performed in Helsinki on 7 July 1801, with the pianist Fredrik Lithander as his accompanist, and in Turku on 30 July, in a concert organized by the orchestra of the Turku Society of Music. In Stockholm Crusell had become acquainted with the French ambassador to Sweden. This friendship encouraged and enabled him to undertake a trip to Paris in 1803. There he performed and also studied clarinet with Jean-Xavier Lefèvre at the newly formed Conservatoire. On 2 June, with the encouragement of Lefèvre, he purchased a new mouthpiece made by Michel Amlingue (1741–1816) and on 14 September a six-key C clarinet made by Jean Jacques Baumann. Before about 1800 Crusell had been playing with the reed turned up, but later turned it down, the modern practice and a position more compatible with cantabile playing. Exactly when he did this is not well established, but he may have favored the reed-above position because of a lack of evenness in his teeth. Around this time the Théâtre-Italien de Paris offered Crusell a position as first clarinetist. Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, anxious to keep Crusell in the royal orchestra, denied a petition for an extension of leave and as a positive inducement made him chief conductor of the bodyguard regiment bands. After Crusell returned to Stockholm he remained with the Royal Court Orchestra until 1833. In June 1811 Crusell made another trip to see Tausch in Berlin, and the two men discussed clarinets. Later that month he visited a benefactor in Leipzig, and in July he purchased a new instrument from Heinrich Grenser in Dresden. His Grenser clarinet was an advanced design for the time, with eleven keys. (A picture of Crusell's Grenser clarinet can be found here.) Later, in 1822, he again went to Dresden and purchased additional clarinets from the Grenser shop's successor, Grenser & Wiesner, and from another maker by the name of Bormann. The Stockholm Music Museum possesses five clarinets made by Grenser & Wiesner in 1822 or later, four with eleven, and one with ten keys. During his career Crusell became increasingly well known as a clarinet soloist, not only in Sweden but also in Germany, and even in England. He played compositions by Beethoven, Jadin, Krommer, Lebrun, Mozart, and Peter Winter, among others. Of more than 50 known concert reviews (most of which appeared in the German ""Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung""), not even one had any negative comment. Carl Abraham Mankell (1802–1868), music critic of ""Svenska Tidningen"" (Swedish News), admired Crusell's playing for the roundness of his tone and its evenness in quality throughout the range of the instrument. Crusell was also greatly admired for his pianissimo playing. ""It is indicative of his reputation that he was for many years the best-paid musician in the court orchestra."" Career as a composer. Between 1791 and 1799 Crusell studied music theory and composition with Abbé Vogler and another German teacher, Daniel Böritz, when Böritz was resident in Stockholm. In 1803 while in Paris Crusell studied composition at the Conservatoire with Gossec and Berton. He composed pieces, including concertos and chamber works, not only for his own use, but also for other wind players in the court orchestra. In 1811 he travelled to Leipzig where he established a relationship with the music publisher Bureau de Musique, which became part of C. F. Peters in 1814. From 1818 to 1837 during the summers he conducted military bands in Linköping, providing them with arrangements of marches and overtures by Rossini, Spohr, and Weber and composing pieces for male choir. In 1822 he published three volumes of songs to texts by the Swedish poet Tegnér and others, and in 1826 another volume, ""Frithiofs saga"", with ten songs to texts by Tegnér. An opera, ""Lilla slavinnan"" (""The Little Slave Girl""), was first performed in Stockholm in 1824 and was repeated 34 times in the following 14 years. Other accomplishments and awards. Crusell was a skillful linguist, translating the important Italian, French, and German operas for performances in Sweden. His translation of Mozart's ""Le nozze di Figaro"", first performed in 1821, resulted in his induction into the Geatish Society, an association of literary academics in Sweden. In 1837 he was awarded a Gold Medal by the Swedish Academy and was inducted into the Order of Vasa, for service to the state and society. The National Library of Sweden holds two manuscript autobiographies. Crusell Music Festival. Since 1982 a Crusell Week has been held each summer in Uusikaupunki, Finland (Bernhard Crusell's place of birth). The festival is dedicated to music for woodwind instruments. Crusell Week’s Artistic Director is Jussi Särkkä. List of musical works.

wikipedia-2316308," USB hub  A USB hub is a device that expands a single USB port into several so that there are more ports available to connect devices to a host system. USB hubs are often built into equipment such as computers, keyboards, monitors, or printers. When such a device has many USB ports they all usually stem from one or two internal USB hubs rather than each port having independent USB circuitry. Physically separate USB hubs come in a wide variety of form factors: from external boxes (looking similar to an Ethernet or network hub) connectible with a long cable, to small designs that can be directly plugged into a USB port (see the ""compact design"" picture). In the middle case, there are ""short cable"" hubs which typically use an integral 6-inch cable to slightly distance a small hub away from physical port congestion and of course increase the number of available ports. Laptop computers may be equipped with many USB ports, but an external USB hub can consolidate several everyday devices (like a mouse and a printer) into a single hub to enable one-step attachment and removal of all the devices. Inverse or sharing hubs. Also available are so-called ""sharing hubs"", which effectively are the reverse of a USB hub, allowing several PCs to access (usually) a single peripheral. They can either be manual, effectively a simple switch-box, or automatic, incorporating a mechanism that recognises which PC wishes to use the peripheral and switches accordingly. They cannot grant both PCs access at once. Some models, however, have the ability to control multiple peripherals separately (e.g., two PCs and four peripherals, assigning access separately). Only the simpler switches tend to be automatic, and this feature generally places them at a higher price point too. Modern KVM switches can also often share USB devices between several computers. Physical layout. A USB network is built from USB hubs connected downstream to USB ports, which themselves may stem from USB hubs. USB hubs can extend a USB network to a maximum of 127 ports. The USB specification requires that bus-powered hubs may not be connected in series to other bus-powered hubs. USB ports are often closely spaced. Consequently, plugging a device into one port may physically block an adjacent port, particularly when the plug is not part of a cable but is integral to a device such as a USB flash drive. A horizontal array of horizontal sockets may be easy to fabricate, but may cause only two out of four ports to be usable (depending on plug width). Port arrays in which the port orientation is perpendicular to the array orientation generally have fewer blockage problems. External ""Octopus"" or ""Squid"" hubs (with each socket at the end of a very short cable maybe 2 inches long), or ""star"" hubs (with each port facing in a different direction, as pictured) avoid this problem completely. Length limitations. USB cables are limited to 3 m for low-speed USB 1.1 device. A hub can be used as an active USB repeater to extend cable length for up to 5 m lengths at a time. Active cables (specialized connector-embedded one-port hubs) perform the same function, but since they are strictly bus-powered, externally powered (non-bus-powered) USB hubs would likely be required for some of the segments. Power. A bus-powered hub is a hub that draws all its power from the host computer's USB interface. It does not need a separate power connection. However, many devices require more power than this method can provide, and will not work in this type of hub.  USB current (related to power) is allocated in units of 100 mA up to a maximum total of 500 mA per port. Therefore a compliant bus powered hub can have no more than four downstream ports and cannot offer more than four 100 mA units of current in total to downstream devices (since the hub needs one unit for itself). If a device requires more units of current than the port it is plugged into can supply, the operating system usually reports this to the user. In contrast a self-powered hub is one that takes its power from an external power supply unit and can therefore provide full power (up to to every port. Many hubs can operate as either bus powered or self powered hubs. However, there are many non-compliant hubs on the market which announce themselves to the host as self-powered despite really being bus-powered. Equally there are plenty of non-compliant devices that use more than 100 mA without announcing this fact (or indeed sometimes without identifying themselves as USB devices at all). These hubs and devices do allow more flexibility in the use of power (in particular many devices use far less than 100 mA and many USB ports can supply more than 500 mA before going into overload shut-off), but they are likely to make power problems harder to diagnose. Some self-powered hubs do not supply enough power to drive a load on every port. For example, many seven port hubs have a 1A power supply, when in fact seven ports could draw a maximum of 7 x 0.5 = 3.5A, plus power for the hub itself. Designers assume the user will most likely connect many low power devices and only one or two requiring a full On the other hand, the packaging for some self-powered hubs states explicitly how many of the ports ports can drive a full load at once. For example the packaging on a seven-port hub might claim to support a maximum of four full-load devices. Dynamic-powered hubs are hubs, which can work as bus-powered as well as self-powered hubs. They can automatically switch between modes depending on if a separate power supply is avalable or not. While switching from bus-powered to self-powered operation does not necessarily require immediate renegotions with the host, switching from self-powered to bus-powered operation may cause USB connections to be reset if connected devices previously requested more power than still available in bus-powered mode. Speed. To allow high-speed (USB 2.0) devices to operate in their fastest mode all hubs between the devices and the computer must be high speed. High-speed devices should fall back to full-speed (USB 1.1) when plugged into a full-speed hub (or connected to an older full-speed computer port). While high-speed hubs can communicate at all device speeds, low and full-speed traffic is combined and segregated from high-speed traffic through a transaction translator. Each transaction translator segregates lower speed traffic into its own pool, essentially creating a virtual full-speed bus. Some designs use a single transaction translator, while other designs have multiple translators. Having multiple translators is a significant benefit when one connects multiple high-bandwidth full-speed devices. It is an important consideration that in common language (and often product marketing) USB 2.0 is used as synonymous with high-speed. However, because the USB 2.0 specification, which introduced high-speed, incorporates the USB 1.1 specification such that a USB 2.0 device is not required to operate at high speed, any compliant full-speed or low-speed device may still be labelled as a USB 2.0 device. Thus, not all USB 2.0 hubs operate at high-speed.  Protocol. Each hub has exactly one upstream port and a number of downstream ports. The upstream port connects the hub (directly or through other hubs) to the host. Other hubs or devices can be attached to the downstream ports. During normal transmission, hubs are essentially transparent: data received from its upstream port is broadcast to all devices attached to its downstream ports; data received from a downstream port is generally forwarded to the upstream port only. This way, what is sent by the host is received by all hubs and devices, and what sent by a device is received by the host but not by the other devices (an exception is resume signaling). Hubs are not transparent when dealing with changes in the status of downstream ports, such as insertion or removal of devices. In particular, if a downstream port of a hub changes status, this change is dealt with in an interaction between the host and this hub; the hubs between them act as transparent in this case. To this aim, each hub has a single interrupt endpoint ""1 IN"" (endpoint address 1, hub-to-host direction) used to signal changes in the status of the downstream ports. When someone plugs in a device, the hub detects voltage on either D+ or D- and signals the insertion to the host via this interrupt endpoint. When the host polls this interrupt endpoint, it learns that the new device is present. It then instructs the hub (via the default control pipe) to reset the port where the new device was plugged in. This reset makes the new device assume address 0, and the host can then interact with it directly; this interaction will result in the host assigning a new (non-zero) address to the device. Transaction translator. Any USB hub that supports higher standard than USB 1.1 (12 Mbit/s) will translate between the lower standard and the higher one via an transaction translator (TT), such that a port with a USB 1.1 device will use this transaction translator to connect with, for example, USB 2.0 on the uplink. However, the default design is that all lower standard devices share the same transaction translator and thus create a bottleneck, a configuration known as single transaction translator. Consequently, multi transaction translators (Multi-TT) were created, which provide more transaction translators such that bottlenecks are avoided. Electronic design. Most USB hubs use one or more integrated controller ICs, of which several designs are available from various manufacturers. Most support a four-port hub system, but hubs using 16-port hub controllers are also available in the industry. USB hubs could be cascaded up to seven levels deep, however maximum number of user devices is reduced by number of hubs. With 50 hubs attached, the maximum number is 127-50=77.

There have been many dentifrices produced over the years, many focusing on marketing strategies to sell products, such as offering whitening capabilities. The most essential dentifrice recommended by dentists is toothpaste which is used in conjunction with a toothbrush to help remove food debris and dental plaque. Dentifrice is also the French word for toothpaste. Types of dentifrices. Toothpaste. Toothpaste is a dentifrice used in conjunction with a toothbrush to help maintain oral hygiene. The essential components are an abrasive, binder, surfactant and humectant. Other ingredients are also used. The scientific and dental community also recommend a fluoride containing toothpaste. The main purpose of the paste is to help remove debris and plaque with some marketed to serve accessory functions such as breath freshening and teeth whitening. Tooth powder. Tooth powder is an alternative to toothpaste. It comes in both a fluoride and non-fluoride version. History of tooth powder. Tooth powder was generally used among the Romans, who used a variety of substances, such as the bones, hoofs, and horns of certain animals; crabs; egg-shells, and the shells of the oyster and the murex. They were reduced to a fine powder after having been previously burnt, and sometimes mixed with honey.  Ingredients that were sometimes added were ground myrrh, nitre and hartshorn. Tooth powder was used to clean and whiten teeth and to fix them when loose, to strengthen the gums, and to assuage toothache. Pounded pumice was a more dubious article, though Pliny the Elder says, ""dentifrices, too, are prepared from it"". The earliest mention of tooth care among the Romans comes from a poem: ""Calpurnius, I greet you with some quick verse. I sent you, just as you asked me to, clean teeth and a bright smile, the product of Araby, a little powder, noble, fine and whitening, something to reduce the swelling of your little gums, to brush away yesterday's leftovers, so that nothing dingey and nasty might be seen should you part your lips in laughter."" This same reference cites the ""utterly repulsive things they do in Spain, according to Catullus: he'd be using his own urine ""to brush his teeth and his red gums.""  By 1924, diatomaceous earth was mined for tooth powder In modern times, baking soda has been the most commonly used tooth powder, although this has now been mostly supplanted by commercial toothpastes. Mouthwash. Mouthwashes come in a variety of compositions, many claiming to kill bacteria that make up plaque or to freshen breath. In their basic form, they are usually recommended to be used after brushing but some manufacturers recommend pre-brush rinsing. Dental research has recommended that mouthwash should be used as an aid to brushing rather than a replacement, because the sticky resistant nature of plaque prevents it from being actively removed by chemicals alone, and physical detachment of the sticky proteins is required.

wikipedia-2316370," Iraqi Navy  The Iraqi Navy is one of the components of the military of Iraq currently being reconstructed by UK-US Coalition forces in Iraq. Its primary responsibilities are the protection of Iraq's coastline and offshore assets. Initially called the ""Iraqi Coastal Defense Force"", its official name was changed on 12 January 2005. As of February 2011, the navy has approximately 5000 sailors and marines which form an Operational headquarters, 5 afloat squadrons, and two marine battalions. Headed by Rear Admiral Muhammad Jawad, the navy had plans to build six ""Al Uboor""-class patrol boats in Baghdad, with the first of the boats to enter service in September 2005. This project however, was ultimately canceled. Additionally, two ""Assad""-class corvettes built for Iraq in the 1980s by Italy were originally planned to be delivered sometime around 2006–2007. The ships however, were found to be in a worse state than originally believed, forcing the Iraqi navy to reconsider the deal and instead buying 4 newer, smaller modified-Diciotti class vessels. The 5 British corvettes and 1 Soviet patrol boat operated by the Saddam-era Iraqi Navy were destroyed in the 2nd and 1st Gulf Wars respectively. At the moment, the Iraqi Navy is designed for coastal water protection; stopping the smuggling of people, oil and weapons; and to protect the country's oil platforms. As a result, the Iraqi Navy mainly needs patrol boats-these could be backed up by fast attack craft. The patrol boats need to have the ability to launch RIBs for boarding ships and also possibly be able to accommodate a helicopter which would increase its patrol capability. The Iraqi Navy is building a second Marine battalion. History. Kingdom of Iraq. The Iraqi Navy was formed in 1937 as a small four-ship force headquartered in Basra. Between 1937 and 1958, it was primarily a riverine force. Republic of Iraq Pre-2003. Following the 14 July Revolution of 1958, the Iraqi navy began to expand. Operationally based in the port of Umm Qasr, the Arabic Gulf Academy for Sea Studies was established in Basra, which offered a bachelor's degree in war and engineering naval studies. By 1988, the Iraqi Navy grew to a force of 5,000, but played a relatively small role during the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. Between 1977 and 1987, the Iraqi Navy received eight Osa class missile boats, equipped with Styx missiles, from the Soviet Union. It also purchased four Lupo class frigates and six Assad class corvettes from Italy, although these were never delivered because of international sanctions following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The Iraqi Navy was almost completely destroyed during the Gulf War of 1991. The Iraqi Navy had 19 ships sunk and 6 vessels damaged. In total, more than 100 Iraqi ships were destroyed. The Navy was not rebuilt and played little part in the Iraq War (2003). One exception was two mine warfare vessels captured by US Navy/Coastguard units during the assault on Al Faw; The tug ""Jumariya"", towing a well camouflaged minelaying barge, and the tug ""Al Raya"", which had been outfitted as a minelayer itself. Of the units that remained by late 2002, most were in a poor state of repair and the crews were in a poor state of readiness. Whatever units that remained after 1991 were used primarily for safeguarding Saddam's palaces on the Tigris river. Republic of Iraq Post-2003. In January 2004, the Iraqi Coastal Defense Force (ICDF) officially began training its first 214 volunteers. On 1 October 2004, the ICFD began coastal patrol operations. On 11 November 2008, Rear Admiral Muhammad Jawad signed the historic non-legally binding Khawr Abd Allah Protocols or ""KAA Protocols"" at the Kuwait Naval Base. The protocols were the concept of the British Royal Navy in 2008 when in command of Combined Task Force 158 operating in the northern Gulf region and specifically within Iraqi territorial waters for the protection of the Iraqi oil terminals Al Basrah Oil Terminal and in support of Iraqi maritime boundaries. They are a non-legally binding military agreement aiding deconfliction between the maritime forces of Kuwait and Iraq in the Khawr Abd Allah waterway and are reflected in a former United Kingdom Hydrographic Office chart and which was re-titled the ""KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart"". The protocols were developed, written and mediated by a British naval lawyer, Major David Hammond Royal Marines, working alongside the heads and staffs of both the Kuwaiti Navy and Iraqi Navy and which saw the historic first meeting on board a British warship HMS Chatham (F87) on 8 May 2008. The protocols were historically ratified and signed on 11 November 2008 at Kuwait Naval Base in the presence of Vice-Admiral Gourtney USN, commander of the United States Naval Forces Central Command based in Bahrain and remain an enduring success story in the region highlighting co-operation and co-ordination between the two countries. David Hammond now heads the Maritime Practice at 9 Bedford Row International Chambers, London - http://9bri.com/members/david-hammond.  On 30 April 2010, Iraqi naval forces took over responsibility for the protection of the Khawr al-Amaya and Basra oil terminals, as well as the ports of Umm Qasr and al-Zubair.

On 15 February 2006 the Iraqi Navy signed a $101 million contract with the Italian Government to provide four Saettia MK4 class Offshore-Patrol Vessels. This is a modified Diciotti class offshore patrol boat, as originally used by the Guardia Costiera. The vessels are to be built by Fincantieri at Riva Trigoso, with modifications including increased crew capacity of 38. The contract also comprises the provision of logistical support and crew training with each crew completing a 7-week training course. In cooperation with the Marina Militare (Italian Navy), each commissioning crew is provided with a week’s bridge simulator course at the Academy in Livorno. In May 2009, the first vessel, Patrol Ship 701 named ""Fatah"" (Arabic for Opening), was handed over at the Muggiano, La Spezia shipyard. The crew hand been training since January 2009, and would now be heading for Umm Qasr, a 20-day/5,000 nautical miles journey via the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Red Sea. There, additional training will be completed, before the vessel takes over duties from the British Royal Marine patrols, who will then revert to a training role of new crew. The vessels will be used to patrol the exclusive economic zone, control maritime traffic, for search and rescue and fire fighting. Swiftships. On September 2009, the Iraqi Navy awarded a $181 million contract to Swiftships Shipbuilders of Morgan City, Louisiana for the construction of nine Model 35PB1208 E-1455 coastal patrol vessels. The vessels are purchased under Foreign Military Sales. The Iraqi Navy is expected by the end of the year to award a $109 million contract to build two 60-meter Off-Shore Support Vessels. The FMS program will contribute $82 million. The ships will provide logistical support for securing the oil platforms, to the Interceptor boats and more than 60 Fast Attack boats. Lieutenant Abdul, the captain of patrol boat 301. Predator Class. The five 27-meter Predator (NHS615) Class patrol boats: (P-101), (P-102), (P-103), (P-104), (P-105); were built by Wuhan Nanhua High-speed Ship Engineering Co., Ltd. and delivered in 2002, they were to be the new ICDF's first ships and were to be purchased under the oil-for-food program. Due to their military compatibilities they were not allowed to enter Iraq until 2003. The vessel has one(1) continuous freeboard main deck with camber and slight fore sheer, one deck house and wheelhouse.The hull below main deck is divided by transversal bulkheads into 4 spaces. The speed of the vessel under sea trial conditions is 32 knots. Crew: 14. Support Vessels. September 2006, an Iraqi marine company will deliver a new ship (Al Shams or the Sun) which was bought from Iraqi aquatic transportation company to be employed as guiding afloat station across the sea in order. In March 2010, the Iraqi Navy awarded a USD70 million contract through FMS to RiverHawk Fast Sea Frames, LLC, Tampa, Florida for two 60-metre offshore support vessels. The two vessels were delivered on 20 December 2012. Future procurement. The Iraqi Navy will reportedly be purchasing ScanEagle UAVs in the near future for maritime reconnaissance support. Exact numbers and delivery dates are still unknown as of January 2012. "
wikipedia-2316386," Hmong American  A Hmong American is a resident of the United States who is of ethnic Hmong descent. Hmong Americans are one group of Asian Americans. Many Lao Hmong war refugees resettled in the U.S. following the communist takeover of Laos in 1975. Beginning in December of that year, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum at this time under the Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. Hmong immigration to U.S.. 1976 and 1980. Initially only 1,000 Hmong people were evacuated to the US. In May 1976, another 11,000 Hmong were allowed to enter the United States. By 1978 some 30,000 Hmong had immigrated to the U.S. This first wave was made up primarily of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's Secret Army, which had been aligned with U.S. war efforts during the Vietnam War. Vang Pao's Secret Army, which was subsidized by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, fought mostly along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, where his forces sought to disrupt North Vietnamese weapons supply efforts to the communist VietCong rebel forces in South Vietnam. Four years later, with the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, families of the Secret Army were also permitted to immigrate to the U.S., representing the second-wave of Hmong immigration to the U.S. The clans which the Hmong take their surnames from are: Chang (Tsaab) or Cha (Tsab), Chao (Tsom), Cheng (Tsheej), Chue (Tswb), Fang (Faaj) or Fa (Faj), Hang (Haam) or Ha (Ham), Her (Hawj), Khang (Khaab) or Kha (Khab), Kong (Koo) or Soung (Xoom), Kue (Kwm), Lee (Lis), Lor (Lauj), Moua (Muas), Thao (Thoj), Vang (Vaaj) or Va (Vaj), Vue (Vwj), Xiong (Xyooj) and Yang (Yaaj) or Ya (Yaj). 1990s and 2000s. Following the 1980 immigration wave, a heated global political debate developed over how the remaining Hmong refugees in Thailand should be handled. Many had been held in squalid Thailand-based refugee camps and the United Nations and the Clinton administration sought to repatriate them to Laos. Reports of human rights violations against the Hmong, including killings and imprisonments, led most Thailand-based Hmong to oppose returning to Laos, even as the conditions of the Thailand-based camps, lacking sufficient funding, worsened. In one of the more prominent examples of apparent Laotian abuse of the Hmong, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok - seeking to reassure the Thai-based Hmong that their safety in Laos would be assured - recruited a former Hmong soldier, Vue Mai, to return to Laos under the repatriation program. However, Vue disappeared in Vientiane, and the U.S. Commission for Refugees later reported that he was arrested by Lao security forces and never again seen. Especially following the Vue Mai incident, the Clinton and U.N. policy of returning the Hmong to Laos began to meet with strong political opposition by U.S. conservatives and some human rights advocates. Michael Johns, a former White House aide to President George H. W. Bush and a Heritage Foundation foreign policy analyst, along with other influential conservatives, led a campaign to grant the Thai-based Hmong immediate U.S. immigration rights. In an October 1995 ""National Review"" article, citing the Hmong's contributions to U.S. war efforts during the Vietnam War, Johns labeled Clinton's support for returning the Thai-based Hmong refugees to Laos a ""betrayal"" and urged Congressional Republicans to step up opposition to the repatriation. Opposition to the repatriation grew in Congress and among Hmong families in the U.S., and Congressional Republicans responded by introducing and passing legislation to appropriate sufficient funds to resettle all remaining Hmong in Thailand in the United States. Clinton, however, vowed to veto the legislation. In addition to opposition to the repatriation by U.S. conservatives, the government of Laos also ultimately expressed reservations about the repatriation, stating that the Hmong remaining in Thailand were heavily involved in heroin and opium traficking. In a significant and unforeseen political victory for the Hmong and their U.S Republican advocates, tens of thousands of Thai-based Hmong refugees were ultimately granted U.S. immigration rights, with the majority being resettled in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The defeat of the repatriation initiative also led to highly emotional reunifications of long separated Hmong families in the U.S. In 2006, the Wisconsin State Elections Board translated state voting documents into the Hmong language. Throughout the Vietnam War, and for two decades following it, the U.S. government stated that there was no ""Secret War"" in Laos and that the U.S. was not engaged in air or ground combat operations in Laos. In the late 1990s, however, several U.S. conservatives, led by Johns and others, alleged that the Clinton administration was using the denial of this covert war to justify a repatriation of Thailand-based Hmong war veterans to Laos and persuaded the U.S. government to acknowledge the existence of the Secret War and to honor the Hmong and U.S. veterans from the war. On May 15, 1997, in a total reversal of U.S. policy, the U.S. government acknowledged that it had supported a prolonged air and ground campaign against the North Vietnamese Army and VietCong. It simultaneously dedicated the Laos Memorial on the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery in honor of the Hmong and other combat veterans from the Secret War. In 1999 there were about 250,000 Hmong people living in the United States, living in multiple areas. While some Hmong remain in refugee camps Thailand, since the September 11, 2001 attacks and the tightening of U.S. immigration laws, especially under the Patriot Act and the Real ID Act, the immigration of Hmong refugees to the U.S. has significantly slowed, in part because most Hmong refugees in Thailand had been engaged in documented armed conflict (even though under U.S. sponsorship) during and after the Vietnam War. U.S. Census statistics. Residents. As of 2009, there are more than 236,400 Americans of Hmong heritage (both naturalized U.S. citizens, and citizens born in the U.S.) based on U.S. Census data from the American Community Survey. States with the largest Hmong population include: California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, although Hmong communities can be found throughout the U.S. The metropolitan areas of Fresno and Minneapolis-St. Paul have especially large Hmong communities. The City of Wausau in Wisconsin has the largest Hmong population per capita in the United States. Today, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, 260,073 people of Hmong decent reside in the United States up from 186,310 in 2000. The vast majority of the growth since 2000 was from natural increase, except for the admission of a final group of over 15,000 refugees in 2004 and 2005 from Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand. Of the 260,073 Hmong-Americans, 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity or race. The Hmong-American population is among the youngest of all groups in the United States, with the majority being under 30 years old, born after 1980, with most part-Hmong are under 10 years old. The ten states with the largest estimated Hmong American populations, according to both the 2010 Census, were California (91,224), Minnesota, (66,181), Wisconsin (49,240), North Carolina (10,864), Michigan (5,924), Colorado (3,859), Georgia (3,623), Alaska (3,534), Oklahoma (3,369), and Oregon (2,920). In terms of metropolitan area, the largest Hmong-American community is in Minneapolis-Saint Paul-Bloomington, MN Metro Area (64,422); followed by Fresno, CA Metro Area (31,771); Sacramento, CA Metro Area (26,996); Milwaukee, WI Metro Area (11,904); and Merced, CA Metro Area (7,254). There are smaller Hmong communities scattered across the country, including cities in California; Michigan (Detroit, Michigan and Warren, Michigan - 4,190), Alaska (Anchorage, Alaska - 3,494); Colorado (Denver, Colorado - 3,426); North Carolina; Georgia (Auburn, Duluth, Monroe, Atlanta, and Winder); Wisconsin (Eau Claire, Appleton, Green Bay, La Crosse, and Sheboygan); Kansas (Kansas City - 1,754); Oklahoma (Tulsa—2,483); Southwest Missouri; Northwest Arkansas; Washington; Oregon and throughout the United States. Education and economic status. The 2000 U.S. Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults. About 7% of Hmong have a bachelor's degree or higher. The lack of formal education among Hmong immigrants is due to the fact that many were once farmers in the hills of Laos or were refugees from war who fled into remote jungles, and had little or no access to schools. In addition, almost 30% of Hmong families are under the poverty level. In St. Paul about 2,000 Hmong people have their bachelor's degree, 150 have their master's degree, and 68 have received their doctoral degree. Hmong-American children born in the United States usually have much better access to education and jobs than that which their parents had, and thus have better economic opportunities than their parents would have had in their former homes. Languages. Most Hmong in the United States speak the dialects White Hmong and Green Hmong with about 60% speaking White Hmong and about 40% speaking Green Hmong. The Centers for Disease Control states ""Though some Hmong report difﬁculty understanding  speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Green Hmong speakers seem to understand one another."" Culture. Even though most Hmong families speak a language other than English at home, many Hmong Americans are rapidly blending into mainstream American society. This is causing the younger generation to lose aspects of their cultural identity at a fast pace. To combat this, the Hmong community has set up associations and media that encourage Hmong people to maintain their language and culture. These include the Hmong National Development association and the ""Hmong Today"" newspaper. Hmong National Development (HND) is a national, 501(c)(3), not-for-profit organization. The goal of HND is to develop leadership and empower the Hmong American community. HND works alongside with local and national organizations, public and private entities, and individuals to encourage educational opportunities, to increase community participation, and to develop resources for the well-being, growth, and full participation of Hmong in society. There is an annual HND conference which usually takes part during the month of April and is held in a different state each year. ""Hmong Today"" publishes communications products for the Hmong community. These products are designed to provide important information to the Hmong community and to promote unity in the Hmong community. ""Hmong Today"" also informs the community at large about the Hmong community. Having a newspaper like ""Hmong Today"" creates a way for businesses, organizations, and schools to connect with the Hmong community. As of 2012, Hmong in California are developing a Hmong-English online translator, in collaboration with Microsoft. As happened with other immigrant groups, some cultural conflicts arose when the Hmong arrived in the U.S. after the Vietnam War. One of the better-documented conflicts occurred in medicine. Anne Fadiman's 1997 nonfiction book ""The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down"" documents one such conflict regarding a young Hmong girl's health care. The girl's parents saw her epileptic seizures as a divine gift, whereas Western medicine viewed them as a serious medical condition. The conflict was exacerbated by communication issues and cultural over-reliance on alternative medicine. A language barrier and what the parents interpreted as condescension and racism on the part of the doctors led the parents to believe the Californian doctors did not have their daughter's best interests at heart, and on several occasions believed the medicines being administered were making their daughter's epilepsy worse. Meanwhile the American doctors remarked that the Hmong were being obstinate and were unable or unwilling to follow instructions in medicating their daughter. There is controversy over whether there was true informed consent from the illiterate parents, who often signed consent forms without an interpreter. Although there are issues about its contents, Fadiman's book is often used when studying cross-cultural medicine. Hmong Americans are fully integrated into the surrounding culture in most areas. Many Hmong Americans serve in the U.S. Military. At least two Hmong have been elected to high public office. In 2002, Mee Moua became the first Hmong American legislator when she was elected to fill the Minnesota State Senate seat vacated by Randy Kelly when he was elected mayor of St. Paul. She is currently the Senate majority whip. Cy Thao is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. At age 14, Joe Bee Xiong fought alongside American soldiers like his father had done. When their village fell to the Communists, Xiong and his family fled to a refugee camp in Thailand and eventually ended up in Wisconsin in 1980. In 1996, Xiong was elected to the Eau Claire (Wisconsin) city council. Xiong was the first Hmong to be elected to a city council in Wisconsin. He ran for the state Assembly in 2004. Xiong was travelling with family in his native country, Laos, when he died, possibly of heart-related complications. Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind worked with Xiong to investigate reports of human rights abuses against Hmong still in Laos and southeast Asia and says Xiong was a great community leader and an inspiration to many. Another Hmong, Thomas T. Vue, presently serves on the Eau Clair city council. In many of the large cities where Hmong Americans live and work, tensions are running high between them and neighboring ethnic groups. Hmong people have often been targets of discrimination, mainly because of job competition and stereotyping of them as welfare dependents. Many of their persecutors justified their actions by claiming that the Hmong unnecessarily took jobs, welfare money, and other services away from long-time residents. Arrests in California in 2007. On June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled ""Operation Flawed Eagle,"" warrants were issued by a California-based U.S. federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various U.S. weapons laws. The federal charges allege that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, with the intent of purchasing them and smuggling them into Thailand in June 2007 for use in Hmong guerrilla war efforts against the Laotian government. The one non-Hmong person of the nine arrested, Harrison Jack, a 1968 West Point graduate and retired Army infantry officer, allegedly attempted to recruit Special Operations veterans to act as mercenaries. On June 15, the defendants were indicted by a grand jury and a warrant was also issued for the arrest of an 11th man, allegedly involved in the plot. The defendants faced possible life prison terms for violation. Vang Pao and other defendants were ultimately granted bail, following the posting of $1.5 million in property. Following the arrests, many Vang Pao supporters had called on President George W. Bush and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to pardon the defendants. On September 18, 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing in a release that the federal government was permitted to consider ""the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted.” On January 10, 2011, charges against all of the remaining defendants were dropped as well.

wikipedia-2316399," Yoshihiro Takayama  Career. Takayama started in UWF International, but due to the focus of the promotion on star Nobuhiko Takada, he wasn't able to go past the mid-card level. In 1995–96, with the interpromotional feuds with New Japan Pro Wrestling and WAR, he formed the ""Golden Cups"" stable with Yoji Anjo and Kenichi Yamamoto to compete in tag team and six-man matches. In New Japan he and Anjo assumed masks as the ""200% Machines"" to mock ""Super Strong Machine"" Junji Hirata. In WAR, they feuded with Gedo, Jado and Hiromichi Fuyuki. After UWFI's subsequent collapse, he joined Kingdom, but after it also collapsed, he joined All Japan Pro Wrestling as a free agent along with former UWFi comrade Masahito Kakihara. In the beginning, Takayama was put in a feud with Toshiaki Kawada (against whom he had lost once in an interpromotional match before the UWFI's collapse), but as he lost matches often, he was back in the undercard. He joined former UWFI foreigner Gary Albright and native Takao Ōmori in a new version of the ""Triangle of Power"" stable Albright had formed with Steve Williams before he briefly went back to the United States. In 1999, upon Shohei Baba's death, Mitsuharu Misawa made him and Kakihara full-time members of All Japan. Pushed as the NO FEAR team with Ōmori, Takayama found instant success, first winning the Asian tag team title from Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki and then the Double Cup from Johnny Ace and Bart Gunn. However, they were eventually defeated by the combination of Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa. In 2000, when Misawa announced plans for his new promotion, Pro Wrestling Noah, Takayama followed him. During the first few months of Noah's existence, Takayama competed in the first ever GHC Heavyweight Championship tournament, but lost to Mitsuharu Misawa in the final match. He found continued success in Noah, winning the new GHC Tag Team Championship with Takao Ōmori, too. It was around 2001 that, spurred by his old UWFI comrades' success in the PRIDE fighting circuit, decided to try his hand at mixed martial arts competition. Although defeated by Kazuyuki Fujita, he impressed ""real-fight"" pundits enough to warrant more fight offers. In what many PRIDE fans consider to be one of the organizations most exciting matches ever, Takayama faced Don Frye in a slugfest at PRIDE 21, and although he lost the match, Takayama solidified his reputation as one of the toughest Japanese fighters in PRIDE. Also, his battle with Frye appeared at number one on Fox Sports Network's ""Best Damn 50 Beatdowns"". Takayama also competed in memorable Noah matches during 2002, winning the GHC Heavyweight Championship from Yoshinari Ogawa on September 7 before losing it to Mitsuharu Misawa later that month. Takayama declared free agency from Noah so he could pursue mixed martial arts, as well as matches in New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he began challenging the top stars, such as Yuji Nagata, Masahiro Chono, and Hiroyoshi Tenzan. In 2003 and 2004 he participated in New Japan's annual G1 Climax tournament. In mid-2004 he affiliated himself with former Pancrase wrestler Minoru Suzuki, and they won the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but he suffered a stroke later in the year following a brutal match with Kensuke Sasaki. During his time away from the ring, Takayama provided occasional colour commentary for Pro Wrestling Noah, famously saying, ""I hope this never ends"" during a chop exchange between Kenta Kobashi and Kensuke Sasaki on the July 18, 2005 ""Destiny"" show. In June 2006, Pro Wrestling Noah announced that Takayama would return at the July 16 Nippon Budokan show, and would team with Kenta Kobashi to take on Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa. The match was later changed due to Kobashi needing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, leading to Takayama teaming with Kensuke Sasaki against Akiyama and Misawa. However, when Kenta Kobashi returned, it would be in the same match, teaming with Yoshihiro Takayama to take on Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa. Takayama then started teaming with old UWFI comrade Takuma Sano in a tournament for the GHC Tag Team Championship vacated by Kenta Kobashi and Tamon Honda due to Kobashi's kidney tumor (Takayama and Sano would reach the final where they would lose to Mohammed Yone and Takeshi Morishima). On December 27, he showed up at a Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX show, attacked former partner Takao Ōmori, and promised to return at the next show. Takayama defeated Great Muta on March 14, 2009 at Pro-Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 7 to win the AJPW Triple Crown Championship. With this victory, Takayama became the second wrestler (the other being Kensuke Sasaki) to win the three major heavyweight titles in Japan: NOAH's GHC Championship, New Japan's IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and All Japan's Triple Crown Championship. Takayama held the Triple Crown for almost seven months, losing the title to Satoshi Kojima on September 26. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Takayama to retain his IWGP Heavyweight Championship. In 2010 Takayama and Sano competed in NOAH's ""Global Tag League"" tournament and emerged the victors, however they were subsequently unable to dethrone the GHC Tag Team Champions Takeshi Rikio and Mohammed Yone. From March 28 to May 2, 2010, Takayama competed in (and eventually won) Pro-Wrestling Noah's 1st ever Global League Tournament. He defeated Jun Akiyama in the final match of the tournament, finishing up with a total of 7 points. It was then announced that due to his victory, Takayama had earned a GHC Heavyweight Championship match versus Takashi Sugiura on July 10. On September 18, 2010, Takayama and Takuma Sano defeated Akitoshi Saito and Bison Smith to win the vacant GHC Tag Team Championship. On January 4, 2011, at New Japan's Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, Takayama and Sugiura defeated Hirooki Goto and Kazuchika Okada in a tag team match. Takayama and Sano would lose the GHC Tag Team Championship to New Japan's Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson on June 18, 2011, in a match contested also for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. In late 2011, Takayama began making appearances for New Japan Pro Wrestling as a member of Minoru Suzuki's Suzukigun, which built to a match on January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he was defeated by Togi Makabe in a singles match. On March 18, Takayama and his Suzukigun stablemate, Lance Archer, unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Acting. Takayama has acted in small parts in several films, beginning with Muscle Heat in 2002, and continuing with Cromartie High - The Movie and Nagurimono in 2005.

wikipedia-2316437," Agrippina Vaganova  Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova (June 26, 1879 – November 5, 1951) was a Russian ballet teacher who developed the Vaganova method – the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old ""Imperial Ballet School"" (today the ""Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet"") under the ""Premier Maître de Ballet"" Marius Petipa throughout the mid to late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus. Her ""Fundamentals of the Classical Dance"" (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique. Her technique is one of the most popular techniques today. She is of Armenian descent.  Vaganova's whole life was connected with the Imperial Ballet (later the Kirov Ballet) of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. She was accepted into the Imperial Ballet School in 1888, the great institution of classical dance founded by Anna of Russia and funded by the Tsars. She graduated from the ""Classe de Perfection"" of the former ""Prima Ballerina"" Eugeniia Sokolova (she was also trained by Ekaterina Vazem, Christian Johansson, Lev Ivanov, Nikolai Legat and Pavel Gerdt).  Ballet did not come easily to Vaganova in her first years as a student, but slowly, through the efforts of her own will power, she was able to join the illustrious Imperial Ballet upon her graduation. By the time she attained the rank of soloist, Saint Petersburg balletomanes dubbed her ""queen of variations"", for her unlimited virtuosity and level of technique.  The old Maestro Petipa cared little for Vaganova as a dancer – any mention of her performances in his diaries were usually followed by such comments as ""awful"" or ""dreadful"". In 1915 the Ballet Master Nikolai Legat cast Vaganova as the Goddess Niriti in his revival of Petipa's 1889 grand ballet ""The Talisman"". Vaganova's portrayal was a great success, and won her promotion to the rank of ""Prima"". Nevertheless, she chose to retire one year later to concentrate on teaching. She started to teach ballet in 1918 at the School of the Baltic Fleet which was founded and led by Akim Volynsky. In 1921 Vaganova began teaching at the ""Choreographic College"", so at that time was called the former Imperial Theater School situated on Rossi street (after the revolution ballet department was separated from the Drama and Music). Though she did have a respectable career as a dancer, her leadership in teaching classical dance was what gave her one of the most respected places in the history of ballet. Her own early struggle with deciphering ballet technique had taught her much. She taught students who would go on to become legends of the dance.  After the Revolution of 1917 the future of ballet in Russia looked grim because of its tradition as court entertainment. Vaganova """"fought tooth and nail"""", as she put it, for the preservation of the legacy of Marius Petipa and the Imperial Ballet. From 1931 to 1937 she was an artistic director of the ballet of the Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theater (Kirov Ballet). In 1933, she staged the classical version of ""Swan Lake"" by Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa with Galina Ulanova as Odette, Olga Jordan as Odile and Konstantin Sergeyev as Prince Siegfried. In 1935 she revived La Esmeralda partly with her own choreography. In 1934 she published her famous book ""Fundamentals of Classical Dance"": it has withstood at least six editions in Russia and was translated into many languages. The same year Vaganova (along with Boris Shavrov) initiated the establishing at the Leningrad Conservatory of pedagogic department for training of future ballet teachers which she began to manage. There, some of her dance school alumnus became her students. Most important names for the dance teaching are Vera Kostrovitskaya (author of ""100 lessons of classical dance""), Nadezhda Bazarova and Varvara P. Mey (authors of the ""Alphabet of Classical Dance"").  Among Vaganova's dance alumnus were the distinguished Soviet ballerinas Marina Semenova, Olga Jordan, Galina Ulanova, Tatiana Vecheslova, Feya Balabina, Natalia Dudinskaya, Galina Kirillova, Alla Shelest, Ninel Petrova, Nonna Yastrebova, Olga Moiseeva, Ludmilla Safronova, Ninel Kurgapkina, Alla Ossipenko and Irina Kolpakova among many others.  Her teaching combined the elegant, refined style of the old French School which Vaganova had been taught by Christian Johansson, the beauty and smoothness of the arms movements of old Russian School, strong and masterly feet technique of Italian School with more vigorous dancing developed in the Soviet Union. Her last school graduation was in 1951 — not long before his death.  She also has been taught the class of perfection for the female dancers of the Kirov Ballet for many years till 1951 when Natalia Dudinskaya succeed her teacher. Shortly after her death, on 1 November 1957 the Choreographic College on Rossi street was renamed in her honor. In 1961, it received the title of ""academic"", in 1991 began to wear the name of Agrippina Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet. "

wikipedia-2316511," Henry rifle  The Henry repeating rifle was a lever-action, breech-loading, tubular magazine rifle. History. The original Henry rifle was a .44 caliber rimfire, lever-action, breech-loading rifle designed by Benjamin Tyler Henry in 1860. The Henry was an improved version of the earlier Volcanic Repeating rifle. The Henry used copper (later brass) rimfire cartridges with a 216 grain (14 g) bullet over 25 grains (1.6 g) of gunpowder. Nine hundred were manufactured between summer and October 1862; by 1864, production had peaked at 290 per month. By the time production ended in 1866, approximately 14,000 units had been manufactured. For a Civil War soldier, owning a Henry rifle was a point of pride. Although it was never officially adopted for service by the Union Army, many soldiers purchased Henrys with their own funds. The brass framed rifles could fire at a rate of 28 rounds per minute when used correctly, so soldiers who saved their pay to buy one often believed it would help them survive. They were frequently used by scouts, skirmishers, flank guards, and raiding parties, rather than in regular infantry formations. To the amazed muzzleloader-armed Confederates who had to face this deadly ""sixteen shooter"", it was called ""that damned Yankee rifle that they load on Sunday and shoot all week!"" Those few Confederate troops who came into possession of captured Henry rifles had little way to resupply the special ammunition used by the weapon, making its widespread use by Confederate forces impractical. The rifle was, however, known to have been used at least in part by some fifteen different Confederate units. These units included cavalry units in Louisiana, Texas, and Virginia, as well as the personal bodyguards of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. While never issued on a large scale, the Henry rifle demonstrated its advantages of rapid fire at close range several times in the Civil War and later during the wars against the Plains Indians. Examples include the successes of two Henry-armed Union regiments at the Battle of Franklin against large Confederate attacks, as well as the Henry-armed Sioux and Cheyenne's destruction of the 7th Cavalry at Little Big Horn. Manufactured by the New Haven Arms Company, the Henry rifle evolved into the famous Winchester Model 1866 lever-action rifle. With the introduction of the new Model 1866, the New Haven Arms Company was renamed the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Mechanical workings. The Henry rifle used a .44 caliber cartridge with of black powder. This gave it significantly less muzzle velocity and energy than other repeaters of the era, such as the Spencer. The lever action, on the down-stroke, ejected the spent cartridge from the chamber and cocked the hammer. A spring in the magazine forced the next round into the chamber; locking the lever back into position sealed the rifle back up into firing position. As it was designed, the rifle was not a very safe weapon. A Henry rifle, when not in use, would either have the hammer cocked or resting on the rim of the cartridge. In the first case, the rifle had no safety and was in firing position. In the second, an impact on the back of the exposed hammer could cause a chambered round to fire. Current production. In 1973, Louis Imperato bought the firearms company of Iver Johnson and began making commercial versions of the M1 carbine. In 1993, Imperato started a factory in his native Brooklyn to manufacture .22 caliber rifles under the newly recreated name of the Henry Repeating Arms Co. which were manufactured in Brooklyn, New York, but are now manufactured in Bayonne, New Jersey. The current company has no actual association with either the New Haven Arms Company, which manufactured the original Henry rifles and was later renamed the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1866, or to Benjamin Tyler Henry, its inventor, and not to be confused with the original Henry rifles, does not produce the Civil War period firearm that this article defines at this time, but will be releasing a tribute rifle that is almost exactly like the original 1860 Henry, chambered in .44-40 Winchester, due to be released 2013–14. It currently produces lever action rifles that are more akin to later Marlin types. All Henry Repeating Arms products and parts are manufactured in the U.S.A. Louis Imperato, Chairman of Henry Repeating Arms, passed away on November 28, 2007. A. Uberti Firearms produces an almost exact copy Henry Model 1860, although it is not available in .44 Henry rimfire. Instead, they are chambered for centerfire calibers such as .44-40 Winchester and .45 Long Colt. These replicas are distributed through Navy Arms Company. They are popular among Civil War reenactors, as well as competition shooters in the N-SSA. In Popular Culture. In the 1985 movie Silverado, a Henry rifle is the firearm of choice for one of the main characters, Malcolm ""Mal"" Johnson, played by Danny Glover. References. Notes Bibliography "
wikipedia-2328984," Jay Novello  Jay Novello (August 22, 1904 – September 2, 1982) was an American radio, film, and television character actor. Born in Chicago as Michael Romano, of Italian descent, Novello began his career as a radio actor, having played Jack Packard on the Hollywood version of ""I Love a Mystery"" for a brief period in the middle 1940s. He usually put his suave, cultured voice and dexterity at accents to use in supporting roles, often of an ethnic nature.  He was heard regularly on ""Rocky Jordan"", (as Cairo police captain Lt. Sam Sabaaya), the radio version of ""The Lone Wolf"" (as Jamison the butler), and the long-running serial ""One Man's Family"" (as Judge Glenn Hunter). He was also heard on ""Escape"", ""Crime Classics"", ""Lux Radio Theater"", ""Suspense"", and ""Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar"", among others. In film, Novello alternated between pompous or fussy professionals and assorted ethnic roles, often as Italian or Hispanic characters. One of his earliest and more familiar film appearances is in the 1945 Laurel and Hardy comedy ""The Bullfighters"", in which Novello plays a Latin restaurateur. Though prolific in the movies, Novello was limited mostly to bits in minor films, one of his more noteworthy assignments being the officious Spanish consul in Frank Capra's ""Pocketful of Miracles"".  Besides several appearances on CBS's ""I Love Lucy"", Novello guest starred on a 1952 episode of CBS's espionage drama ""Biff Baker, U.S.A."", starring Alan Hale, Jr. He appeared too on NBC's ""Northwest Passage"" series, based on the work of Major Robert Rogers in the French and Indian War. He appeared with James Best, John Dehner, and Paul Richards in 1956 on NBC's western anthology series ""Frontier"" in the episode ""The Texicans"". About this time, he also guest starred in Brian Keith's first series, ""Crusader"", a Cold War drama which aired on CBS. He was cast in a 1955 episode as Andre in ""Sock Plays Cupid"" of Jackie Cooper's NBC sitcom, ""The People's Choice"". In 1957, he guest starred in Frank Lovejoy's NBC detective series, ""The Adventures of McGraw"", initially titled ""Meet McGraw"".In 1958, he was cast in five episodes as Juan Greco on ABC's ""Zorro"", with Guy Williams and in this same year he showed the power of his acting ability by playing the role of Gio Bartolo in the episode ""Sidewalk Fisherman"" in the acclaimed TV series Naked City. Novello guest starred in episodes of two ABC sitcoms, ""The Donna Reed Show"" as Nick Melinas in ""The Love Letter"" (1960) and on ""The Real McCoys"", in which he plays the fiance of Gladys Purvis (Lurene Tuttle), the widowed mother of Kate McCoy (Kathleen Nolan). At first the Novello character clashes with Grandpa Amos McCoy (Walter Brennan), but the two are reconciled over a game of horseshoes. In 1957 and 1960, Novello appeared in two episodes of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, ""Colt .45"", starring Wayde Preston. He also appeared in the ABC/WB detective series, ""Bourbon Street Beat"", starring Andrew Duggan. He guest starred as Beanie in the 1958 episode ""Arson"" of David Janssen's CBS crime drama, ""Richard Diamond, Private Detective"". In 1962 he played coin collector Nickolas Trevelian in ""The Case of the Captain's Coins"". He appeared in the syndicated crime drama, ""Johnny Midnight"", starring Edmond O'Brien. Novello guest starred twice on CBS's ""The Andy Griffith Show"", as the main character in the episode entitled ""Guest of Honor"" and as an opportunist lawyer in ""Otis Sues the County"". He secured an early guest spot on the television incarnation of ""Gangbusters"" as famed bank robber Willie Sutton. He was a regular on ABC's ""McHale's Navy"" as the con artist Mayor Mario Lugatto of Volta Fiore, Italy.  He appeared in the episode of ""Climax!"", ""Escape From Fear"", and had a recurring role on ""Zorro"" as Juan Greco. Novello also appeared in several episodes of ABC's ""Lawman"", with John Russell and Peter Brown. He was cast as Guido Morales in the 1960 episode ""Unsurrendered Sword"" of another ABC western series, ""The Rebel"", starring Nick Adams. He died in 1982, aged 78, and is interred in Los Angeles, California, at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery. "

Three cars were offered in the first year, an 18 hp, a 24 hp and a 50 hp. In 1905 they started making very large engined racing cars with a 14.8 Litre 5 cylinder model which won the Coppa Florio and the year after that the Targa Florio. In 1907 a 35/45 hp model driven by Count Scipione Borghese won the Peking to Paris motor race by three weeks. These sporting successes helped sales dramatically, the company continued to grow. The company experimented with a range of novel engines such as variable stroke, sleeve valve, and ""Avalve"" rotary types and at the beginning of World War I, offered a wide range of cars. During the war Itala built aeroplane engines but made a loss producing them. After the armistice car production resumed with models based on the pre war cars such as the Tipo 50 25/35 hp and a re-appearance of the Avalve in the Tipo 55 but financial success eluded the company From 1924 the company was being run under receivership and they appointed Giulio Cesare Cappa from Fiat as general manager. He produced a new car, the Tipo 61 with 7 cylinder alloy engine which was well received but he then decided to return to motor sport producing the Tipo 11, a very advanced car with front wheel drive, 1050 cc supercharged V12 engine and all round independent suspension but the car never raced. Two Tipo 61s did take part in the 1928 Le Mans 24 hour race winning the 2 litre class. The company was bought by truck maker Officine Metallurgiche di Tortona in 1929 and a few more cars were made up to 1935. The remains of the company was sold to Fiat. Itala rotary valves. A distinctive feature of the pre-World War I 50 hp & 90 hp models was their use of a rotary valve. Each valve fed a pair of cylinders and was mounted alongside, rotating parallel to them. Four ports cast into the valve alternately connected ports to the cylinders through the side of the valve to the inlet and exhaust manifolds at bottom and top of the valves. Leo Villa. Leo Villa began his career as a racing mechanic working on these rotary valve engines for the driver Giulio Foresti. He met Malcolm Campbell, when in 1923, Campbell took over the Itala and Ballot concessions in London. Seeing the publicity potential of racing them at Brooklands, Campbell also bought two of Foresti's race-prepared cars. Foresti and Villa delivered them in person from Paris to Campbell's house at Povey Cross. Impressed by Campbell's wealth and ambitions, Villa accepted an offer to become his permanent mechanic. "

wikipedia-2329101," Nodal analysis  In electric circuits analysis, nodal analysis, node-voltage analysis, or the branch current method is a method of determining the voltage (potential difference) between ""nodes"" (points where elements or branches connect) in an electrical circuit in terms of the branch currents. In analyzing a circuit using Kirchhoff's circuit laws, one can either do nodal analysis using Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) or mesh analysis using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Nodal analysis writes an equation at each electrical node, requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation must give current as a function of voltage; an admittance representation. For instance, for a resistor, Ibranch = Vbranch * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of the resistor. Nodal analysis is possible when all the circuit elements' branch constitutive relations have an admittance representation. Nodal analysis produces a compact set of equations for the network, which can be solved by hand if small, or can be quickly solved using linear algebra by computer. Because of the compact system of equations, many circuit simulation programs (e.g. SPICE) use nodal analysis as a basis. When elements do not have admittance representations, a more general extension of nodal analysis, modified nodal analysis, can be used. While simple examples of nodal analysis focus on linear elements, more complex nonlinear networks can also be solved with nodal analysis by using Newton's method to turn the nonlinear problem into a sequence of linear problems. Examples. Basic case. The only unknown voltage in this circuit is V1. There are three connections to this node and consequently three currents to consider. The direction of the currents in calculations is chosen to be away from the node. With Kirchhoff's current law, we get: formula_1 This equation can be solved in respect to V1: formula_2 Finally, the unknown voltage can be solved by substituting numerical values for the symbols. Any unknown currents are easy to calculate after all the voltages in the circuit are known. formula_3 Supernodes. In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V1 and V2. The voltage at V3 is already known to be VB because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential. The current going through voltage source VA cannot be directly calculated. Therefore we can not write the current equations for either V1 or V2. However, we know that the same current leaving node V2 must enter node V1. Even though the nodes can not be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining of the two nodes is called the supernode technique, and it requires one additional equation: V1 = V2 + VA. The complete set of equations for this circuit is: formula_4 By substituting V1 to the first equation and solving in respect to V2, we get: formula_5 "

wikipedia-2329154," Madness and Civilization  Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason () is a 1964 abridged edition of French philosopher Michel Foucault's 1961 work ""Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique"". An English translation of the complete 1961 edition, entitled ""History of Madness,"" was published in June 2006. Foucault's first major book, it is an examination of the evolving meaning of madness in European culture, law, politics, philosophy and medicine from the Middle Ages to the end of the eighteenth century, and a critique of historical method and the idea of history. It marks a turning in Foucault's thought away from phenomenology toward structuralism: though he uses the language of phenomenology to describe an evolving experience of ""the other"" as mad, he attributes this evolution to the influence of specific powerful social structures. Origins. The book developed out his earlier writing on psychology, his own psychological difficulties, and his experiences working in a mental hospital, and was written mainly between 1955 and 1959 while working in cultural-diplomatic and educational posts in Sweden (as director of a French cultural centre attached to the University of Uppsala), Germany, and Poland. Discussion of madness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the ""Classical Age"" (the later seventeenth and most of the eighteenth centuries) and the modern experience. He argues that in the Renaissance the mad were portrayed in art as possessing a kind of wisdom – a knowledge of the limits of our world – and portrayed in literature as revealing the distinction between what men are and what they pretend to be. This Renaissance art and literature depicted the mad as engaged with the reasonable while representing the mysterious forces of cosmic tragedy, but it also marked the beginning of an objective description of reason and unreason (as though seen from above) compared with the more intimate medieval descriptions from within society. Foucault contends that in the mid-seventeenth century, in the depths of the age of reason, the rational response to the mad, who until then had been consigned to society's margins, was to separate them completely from society by confining them, along with prostitutes, vagrants, blasphemers and the like, in newly created institutions all over Europe – a process he calls ""the Great Confinement."" The social forces Foucault sees driving this confinement include the need for an extrajudicial mechanism for getting rid of undesirables, and the wish to regulate unemployment and wages (the cheap labour of the workhouses applied downward pressure on the wages of free labour). The condition of these outcasts was seen as one of moral error. They were viewed as having freely chosen prostitution, vagrancy, blasphemy, unreason, etc. and the regimes of these new rational institutions were meticulous programs of punishment and reward aimed at causing them to reverse those choices. He argues that the conceptual distinction between the mad and the rational was in a sense a product of this physical separation into confinement, that confinement made the mad conveniently available to medical doctors who began to view madness as a natural object worthy of study, and then as an illness to be cured. For Foucault the modern experience began at the end of the eighteenth century with the creation of places devoted solely to the confinement of the mad under the supervision of medical doctors, and these new institutions were the product of a blending of two motives: the new goal of ""curing"" the mad away from their family who could not afford the necessary care at home, and the old purpose of ""confining"" undesirables for the protection of society. These distinct purposes were lost sight of, and the institution soon came to be seen as the only place where therapeutic treatment can be administered. He sees the nominally more enlightened and compassionate treatment of the mad in these new medical institutions as just as cruel and controlling as their treatment in the earlier, rational institutions had been. ...modern man no longer communicates with the madman [...] There is no common language: or rather, it no longer exists; the constitution of madness as mental illness, at the end of the eighteenth century, bears witness to a rupture in a dialogue, gives the separation as already enacted, and expels from the memory all those imperfect words, of no fixed syntax, spoken falteringly, in which the exchange between madness and reason was carried out. The language of psychiatry, which is a monologue by reason ""about"" madness, could only have come into existence in such a silence.Foucault, ""Preface to the 1961 edition"". Criticism. From 'Michel Foucault's Phanomenologie des Krankengeistes' by Gary Gutting (1994): Brazilian sociologist José Guilherme Merquior discusses ""Madness and Civilization"" in his book ""Foucault"" (1985; part of the Fontana Modern Masters series on prominent intellectuals). Merquior argues that while Foucault raises important questions about the influence of social forces on the meaning of, and responses to, deviant behavior, ""Madness and Civilization"" is nonetheless so riddled with serious errors of fact and interpretation as to be of very limited value. For example, Merquior notes that there is abundant evidence of widespread cruelty to and imprisonment of the insane during eras when Foucault contends that the mad were perceived as possessing wisdom, and that Foucault has thus selectively cited data that supports his assertions while ignoring contrary data. Madness was typically linked with sin by Christian Europeans, noted Merquior, and was therefore regarded as much less benign than Foucault tends to imply. "
wikipedia-2329187," Frölunda HC  Frölunda Hockey Club, also known as the Frölunda Indians, are a Swedish professional ice hockey club based in Gothenburg. They are currently playing in the highest Swedish league, Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien), where they have played the majority of the seasons during its existence. The last time they played in the lower division, Allsvenskan, was in 1995. Frölunda have won the national championship title three times, in 1965, 2003, and 2005. The club was originally founded on 3 February 1938, as an ice hockey section in Västra Frölunda IF and became independent on 29 March 1984. On 16 June 2004, the club shortened the name from Västra Frölunda Hockey Club to Frölunda Hockey Club. Frölunda's home venue is the Scandinavium arena in central Gothenburg, which has a capacity of 12,044 people. Frölundaborg is used when Scandinavium is occupied with other events. Förlunda's average home attendance has been the highest in the league for over a decade. History. In 2003 Frölunda became the champions after a 38 year hiatus. The final game in Scandinavium on 7 April against Färjestad BK was ended by late season recruit Tomi Kallio in the third overtime period. In the 2004–05 season, the club's 60th anniversary and 20th as independent club, the team won the league title, by having the best record during the regular season, and the Swedish Championship. That particular year was notable because the National Hockey League had a labour stoppage due to negotiations between the league and the players association. Many professional hockey players who could not play in the NHL chose to play in European or North American leagues. The largest number of professional NHL players were in Sweden during the season, including Gothenburg native Daniel Alfredsson, who joined his hometown club for the season. This increased the quality of play and many observers said that Elitserien was the best league in the world during 2004–05. Frölunda set a new Elitserien record on 6 April 2006, by winning the Elitserien playoff semi finals against Linköpings HC 4–3 after trailing the series 1–3. The season ended with a 2–4 defeat against Färjestads BK in the finals. The second game in the finals Ronnie Sundin played his 685th game for Frölunda becoming the player with most career games for the club. Season-by-season results. ""This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by Frölunda. For the full season-by-season history, see Frölunda HC seasons."" Honored members. Frölunda Hockey have retired the numbers of four players, all on 3 March 2002. The number retired were; the number 13 worn by Lars Erik Lundvall, who spent eight seasons with Frölunda, all of them serving as team captain. The number 14 worn by Ronald ""Sura Pelle"" Pettersson, who spent seven seasons with Frölunda before suffering a career-ending injury on 14 December 1967. The duo of Lundvall and Pettersson was one of the reason behind Frölunda's success in the 60's and secured that hockey got a strong foothold in Gothenburg. The number 19 worn by Jörgen Pettersson during his two stints with Frölunda. Pettersson joined the club in 1970 and played ten seasons for the club before joining the St. Louis Blues of the NHL. After five seasons in the NHL he returned and played another three seasons for the club. The number 29 worn by Stefan Larsson during his sixteen seasons with Frölunda. With the exception of two seasons, Larsson played for Frölunda his entire professional career. Two Frölunda players have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation's Hall of Fame. Forward Ulf Sterner, played three seasons for Frölunda before becoming the first European-trained player to play in the NHL during his short sojourn with the New York Rangers during the 1964–65 NHL season; he was inducted in 2001. Forward Ronald ""Sura Pelle"" Pettersson, represented team Sweden in three olympic games and ten IIHF World Championships, totaling 252 games played for the national team; he was inducted in 2004. In 2003, former Frölunda players Christian Ruuttu and Jorma Salmi were inducted to the Finnish Hockey Hall of Fame. "

The narrative follows the adventures of the eponymous character Weetzie and her best friend Dirk, as well as their friends and relations. After being granted three wishes by a genie, Weetzie discovers that there are unexpected ramifications. The story is set in an almost dream-like, heightened version of Los Angeles, aptly referred to as ""Shangri-L.A."", in an indefinite time period evoking both the 1980s punk craze and the sophisticated glamor of 1950s Hollywood. Block describes issues such as blended families, premarital sex, homosexuality, and AIDS. Reception.

Critics such as Rebecca Platzner offer that, while the material is suggestive, the dialogue that it establishes about these depictions is vital to a developing young adult’s perspectives on difficult social issues.

wikipedia-2329421," Roasted barley tea  Roasted barley tea is a caffeine-free, roasted-grain-based tisane made from barley, which is popular in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cuisine. It is also used as a caffeine-free coffee substitute in American cuisine. Barley water is a popular traditional soft drink in Britain. Roasted barley tea is called in Japanese, dàmàichá (大麦茶) or màichá (麦茶 or 麥茶) in Mandarin Chinese, and boricha (보리차) in Korean. While the tea is generally regarded as a cooling summer beverage in Japan, it is served year-round, hot in winter and cold in summer, in Korea. Originally, roasted barley seeds were stewed in hot water (this is still the method generally used in Korea), but tea bags containing ground barley became more popular during the early 1980s; this is now the norm in Japan. It can be found from many different distributors in vending machines all over Japan.  In Korea, roasted unhulled barley is used to prepare the tea. Often the barley is combined with ""oksusu cha"" (roasted corn), as the corn's sweetness offsets the slightly bitter flavor of the barley. A similar drink, made from roasted brown rice, is called ""hyeonmi cha"" (tisane) or ""genmaicha"" (with green tea added). Roasted barley tea, sold in ground form and sometimes combined with chicory or other ingredients, is also sold as a coffee substitute. Research. Roasted barley tea was found to inhibit bacterial colonization and adhesion, specifically to the major cause of tooth decay and implicated in cardiovascular diseases, Streptococcus mutans biofilms. It also lowers blood viscosity, proportional to the level of alkylpyrazine in the tea. However, the roasting process revealed 200-600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide among Japanese mugicha. Acrylamide and its metabolite, glycidamide, react readily with a number of biomolecules including haemoglobin. "

The organisation's mission statement declares that: Irish Northern Aid is an American based membership organization that supports through peaceful means, the establishment of a democratic 32-county Ireland. Our Strategy: To develop a broad coalition of supporters for Irish Unity through organizing and educating the public, our members, political leaders, and the media. To support the current Peace Process, including the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by the vast majority of the Irish people. To support a process of National reconciliation and equality for all the citizens of Ireland. Membership: In keeping with the principles of the 1916 Proclamation, Irish Northern Aid is open to anyone who shares these values. Unionist politicians and the British, Irish and United States governments have accused Noraid of being a front for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and that it was involved in fund raising for IRA arms importation from North America since the early 1970s. This accusation has always been denied by Noraid. Noraid's former leader, Martin Galvin, was banned from the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The charge was also disputed by historian Ed Moloney who stated that the funds raised by NORAID went largely to the families of IRA volunteers, while Clan na Gael was the principal financial backer of the Provisional IRA. In May 1981, the U.S. Department of Justice won a court case forcing Noraid to register the Provisional Irish Republican Army as its """"foreign principal"""", under the Foreign Agents Registration Act 1938. A compromise was reached which allowed Noraid to include a written disclaimer against the court ruling stating the document had been signed under force and that Noraid maintained that the IRA was not its ""foreign principal"". Federal attorneys agreed to this, and Noraid resumed filing its financial returns in July 1984. The group was supportive of the peace process and the subsequent Good Friday Agreement.

In a surprise attack, Habsburg Imperial forces routed the Ottoman army which was in the process of crossing the river. At the cost of a few hundred losses, the Habsburg forces inflicted 30,000 casualties on the Ottomans, dispersed the remainder and captured the Ottoman treasure. As an immediate consequence, the Ottoman Empire lost control over Bosnia, while in the long run, the Habsburg victory at Zenta was the last decisive step to force the Ottoman Empire into the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), ending the Ottoman control of large parts of Central Europe. Prelude. After the relief of the Habsburg capital in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, Austria enjoyed great success and by 1688 Belgrade and most of the Pannonian Plain was occupied by Habsburgs. But as the war with the French demanded more troops, and the new grand vizier reorganized and reinvigorated the Ottoman Army, the success ended. Belgrade was recaptured by the Ottomans in 1690 and the following year’s campaign was relatively indecisive.

As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service. The Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces (approx. 7,000 soldiers). Thanks to Palatine Paul Eszterházy, Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg Wars with 20,000 soldiers. Serb light cavalry and militia conscripts also took part in the coalition.

When Eugene learned of these movements, he decided to force a battle. On 11 September 1697, the Ottoman army began to ford the river Tisa (Tisza, Theiß) near Zenta (Senta), unaware that the Hungarian Imperial Army was nearby. The Imperial army was able to surprise and attack the Ottoman forces while they were in the process of crossing the river. After an intensive artillery bombardment, many Imperial Dragoon regiments dismounted and proceeded to the moat encircling and engaging the Ottoman camp. Ottoman troops behind the entrenchments retreated in confusion to the bridge, which was now overcrowded. Austrian artillery targeted the Ottoman troops and slaughtered them. The left flank of the Imperial army attacked, penetrating between the Ottoman left flank and the bridge, cutting off their retreat. At the same time, Imperial forces attacked from the front and, after ferocious close-quarter fighting, broke through the trenches surrounding the Ottoman camp. Inside the camp, beyond the camp-wagons, the slaughter was terrible. Imperial soldiers pressed the attack relentlessly. Barely a thousand Ottoman soldiers escaped. More than 10,000 Ottoman troops drowned in the Tisa river. Up to 20,000 Ottoman soldiers were slaughtered on the battlefield. Aftermath. The battle was an amazing victory for Austria; at the cost of 500 men they had inflicted the loss of 30,000 men and captured the sultan's harem, 87 cannons, the royal treasure chest and the state seal of the Ottoman Empire. According to ""Prinz Eugen"" (1960, biography) by Alexander Lernet-Holenia, the startled Austrians even captured a train of camels. The main Ottoman army was scattered and the Austrians gained complete freedom of action in Bosnia, where Sarajevo was sacked. By the terms of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the Austrians forced the sultan Mustafa II to make peace with the Emperor, and to cede Transylvania and the Ottoman eyalets of Egri, Varat, and Kanije, as well as much of the eyalet of Budin and parts of the eyalets of Temeşvar and Bosnia. These territories were later transformed or integrated into Habsburg provinces known as the Principality of Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Slavonia, and the Military Frontier. After this treaty, Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was enlarged and included one part of the lands that formerly were administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (In the 16th century, the territory formerly administered by the Kingdom of Hungary was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy (see: Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)), the Ottoman Empire (see: History of Hungary during Ottoman administration) and the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom centered in Transylvania). Many Imperial soldiers were rewarded after the bloody battle. John de la Feld (who led the fight for Prince Eugene) was thereupon created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. "
wikipedia-2329605," Laserbeak  Laserbeak (with various spellings) is the name given to several fictional characters in the various Transformers universes. He is almost always a mechanical bird, and is partnered with Soundwave. Transformers: Generation 1. According to original tech spec notes written by Bob Budiansky found at Iacon One in 2006, the original name for Laserbeak was Slazer. Laserbeak, along with Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy, Buzzsaw, and Ratbat, works in tandem with Soundwave. Laserbeak is exceptionally loyal to Soundwave and thus Megatron. Laserbeak's name is derived from his back mounted lasers, which are powered by ruby crystals. While these powerful weapons are a great strength, they can also be a weakness since they are dependent on a supply of the rare crystals. Laserbeak is very cowardly and will only fight from afar, or in situations in which he has the overwhelming advantage. Buzzsaw and Garboil are similar in appearance to Laserbeak, but have slightly different colors. Reception. According to X-Entertainment Laserbeak was the most popular of the Decepticon cassettes in the Transformers cartoon. Marvel Comics. Laserbeak was one of the original ten Decepticons that fell to Earth in the ""Ark"". Being reactivated and given the Earthen mode of a condor, Laserbeak would participate in many of the early battles against the Autobots—until a disastrous raid by Megatron led to Buzzsaw, Starscream, Skywarp, Thundercracker, Rumble and Frenzy, getting deactivated by Omega Supreme. Laserbeak and Megatron managed to escape, but Laserbeak would play a lesser role, serving Shockwave and then Ratbat before participating in the battles against Scorponok's Decepticons and then against the Autobots using their united force. None realized, however, that the battles were a ruse by Starscream to gain the power of the Underbase for himself. The Autobots and Decepticons would then unite to stop him, but Starscream's power was too great, and Laserbeak was one of those deactivated. He was not seen again, apart from an appearance as part of Galvatron's forces in a nightmare alternate reality where Unicron had destroyed Cybertron, and Galvatron's Decepticons ruled Earth. Laserbeak was often shown to be capable of speech in the Marvel Comics, as opposed to his mute animated rendition. Animated series. Prior to the Transformers' arrival on Earth, Laserbeak worked with Soundwave on Cybertron. His alternate mode was still a cassette, but his robot mode was an alien type of bird with rounded wings, looking like some form of hovercraft with his optics resembling an opaque cockpit canopy.

After the reactivation of both sides on Earth, Laserbeak was given the Earth mode of a condor, quickly coming into combat with Hound. He served as the Decepticons' chief spy, infiltrating the Ark on numerous occasions, spying on their human allies and even knocking out Optimus Prime so that Megatron could make a copy of him.

Laserbeak was used countless times as a reconnaissance platform, uncovering key plans of the Autobots throughout the war. He was also used to pursue and attack individuals attempting to escape. He once made use of a self-guided cannon to attack one Autobot while simultaneously pursuing another personally. He has also captured several humans during his stay on Earth. Laserbeak's appearances in season three were diminished, mostly due to the introduction of Ratbat, whose bat mode could fit into crevices Laserbeak couldn't, making him a more effective spy.

wikipedia-2329619," Dez Dickerson  Dez Dickerson (born Desmond D'andrea Dickerson in 1955 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American guitarist and singer who was a member of Prince's former band, The Revolution. Biography. A veteran of numerous Minneapolis rock bands, Dickerson answered Prince's call for a touring musician in the ""Twin Cities Reader"", a local entertainment paper, in 1979. After a 15 minute audition in the back of Del's Tire Mart, Dickerson was picked as guitarist. He became a fan-favorite in concert. He was soon recognized as much for his trademark ""Rising Sun"" headband as for his blistering guitar work. In 1980 when off the road for Christmas break, Dickerson had a profound conversion experience and became a born-again Christian. Afterwards, performing songs with sexual themes began to trouble his conscience. Even though Dickerson's and Prince's popularity were growing, he desired more and more to quit the band. He contributed songs for Prince's side projects, writing ""He's So Dull"" for Vanity 6, and co-writing ""Wild And Loose"", ""After Hi School"", and ""Cool"" for The Time. Dickerson contributed vocals to ""Little Red Corvette"" and ""1999"" on the ""1999"" album, as well as the guitar solo for ""Little Red Corvette"" that ranked #64 on Guitar World's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos.  However, following the ""1999"" tour, Dickerson left the band to pursue other options. He was replaced by Wendy Melvoin. After leaving the Revolution, Dickerson formed his own short-lived band, the Modernaires and toured in support of Billy Idol on his 1984 ""Rebel Yell"" tour, frequently joining Idol onstage. Dickerson appeared in the movie ""Purple Rain"" with the Modernaires, but their song was not released as a single nor on the ""Purple Rain"" soundtrack. A solo recording deal failed to materialize, however, and in 1987, Dickerson relocated to Nashville to back singer Judson Spence. He also kept busy with session work and producing other artists.  In 1990, Dickerson was named Vice President of A&R with the CCM label Starsong Communications. Four years later he founded his own label, Absolute Records, a Christian-rock record company. Artists on his label included Squirt, These 5 Down and Metropolis aka Metropolis America. He released a solo album in the late 1990s entitled ""Oneman"". He recently released a book, ""My Time with Prince-Confessions of a Former Revolutionary"", which tells of his time with Prince and the Revolution from his first audition in 1978 until his departure in 1983. Many fans agree that Dickerson never got the music industry break that he deserved as a black rock artist in the 80s.  In 2005, Dickerson released a double CD retrospective collection of his work from 1982 to 1987. It marked the long-awaited official release of the complete version of the classic ""Modernaire"". Taken from the film ""Purple Rain"" and featuring Prince on guitars, keyboards and backing vocals, this track was released on vinyl in 2008 by the UK label, Citinite. Also in 2005, a 3-CD set was released entitled ""Rock of Ages - Where Classic Hymns Meet Classic Rock!"". This was produced, arranged, recorded and mixed by Dez Dickerson. Featuring trademark powerful guitar riffs, it presented 32 well-known hymns in a rock format, with Dez playing many of the instruments. Joining Dez on this project was his son, Jordan Dickerson, who contributed drums to many of the tracks and bass guitar on some. Jordan also arranged ""Agnus Dei"". Currently Dickerson manages record label and branding companies Pavilion Entertainment and Pavilion Synergies in Nashville. He has been seen moderating panels at music conferences such as South by Southwest. He appeared as a keynote speaker at Brooklyn's Northside Festival in June 2012 where he coined the phrase ""ROA"" (Return on Audience). "
wikipedia-2329621," Cedric Benson  Cedric Myron Benson (born December 28, 1982) is an American football running back who is currently a free agent. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears fourth overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football for The University of Texas at Austin. Benson was also a member of the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers. Early years. Benson began to emerge as a football stand-out in the eighth grade while attending Abell Junior High School in Midland, Texas under Coach Chris McKinney. Benson attended Robert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, and finished his career with 8,423 rushing yards (the most in Texas 5A history and the fourth most in Texas high school football history). He led his team to three consecutive State Championships, and rushed for a total of 15 touchdowns in the three championship games. Cedric rushed for more than 1,900 yards in only 9 games. He was the first high school player to ever make the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football annual magazine. Cedric was also a center fielder on the baseball team. As a senior, in District 4-5A games, he hit .361 with 4 home runs and 14 RBIs. Baseball career. Benson was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 12th round (370th overall) of the 2001 MLB Draft. While Benson did not play in the major leagues, he spent his time with the Dodgers playing in their summer league at Vero Beach. He also played with the Gulf Coast League Dodgers. In 15 at-bats he had 5 hits, 2 runs, 3 doubles, 2 triples, and 2 RBIs. College career. Benson was a four-year starter at the University of Texas at Austin, where he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back in 2004. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank sixth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in school history. Benson was a 2004 All-America selection. He has often been compared to Ricky Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications, and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players. While attending the University of Texas, Benson majored in social work and sociology. During his latter years, he earned membership into the Texas' Athletics Director's Academic Honor Roll, and the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll in fall of 2003. Also, while in college, Benson was arrested twice, once for possession of marijuana and the other for criminal trespass. The marijuana case was dropped after a friend came forward and claimed ownership. He received 8 days in jail for the trespass conviction although he spent no time in jail other than the day of arrest due to overcrowding in Travis County Jail. He was forced to serve a one half game suspension against Baylor. Professional career. Chicago Bears. The Chicago Bears selected Benson as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, making him the highest drafted Bears player since Dan Hampton in 1979. The Bears’ organization and Benson could not come to terms on a contract, causing him to miss the entire Bears' training camp. After a thirty-six day hold-out, Benson signed a five-year contract worth thirty-five million dollars. The Bears wished to make Benson their feature running back, but his lengthy contract impasse had caused him to miss a significant portion of practice. Benson claims that he received a cold reception upon his return because he claimed he would be starting by the third game despite holding out and not practicing. Jay Glazer reported that certain players even attempted to intentionally injure him during drills, though former Bears guard Ruben Brown has denied such claims. The team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for beginning of the 2005 season. Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season. After the 2005 season, the Bears considered making Benson the team's featured running back after Thomas Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason. Although Benson fully recovered from his injury, Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm. Days later, Benson challenged Lovie Smith’s coaching by remarking, ""the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field."" The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers. Benson became the Bears' secondary running back again during the playoffs. In the against the New Orleans Saints, Benson scored a fourth-quarter touchdown and totaled 60 yards. Though he was given a majority of the team's carries, his counterpart, Jones, amassed two touchdowns and 123 rushing yards. In the team's following game, Super Bowl XLI, Benson sustained a knee injury in the first half, and missed the remainder of the game. Lovie Smith named Benson as the Bears' starting running back after the team traded Thomas Jones to the New York Jets. Benson struggled throughout the preseason, but received enough support from his teammates and coaches to retain his starting position. He amassed only forty-two yards in his first regular season game and committed a costly turnover. However, Benson rebounded with a 101-yard performance during his next start. After several inconsistent games, Benson began to stabilize after the bye week. In one of his best games of the season, Benson rushed for eighty-nine yards and scored one touchdown on eleven attempts. He averaged 5.8 yards in his next game, but sustained a season-ending ankle injury. Benson, who had amassed 647 yards and four touchdowns, was eventually relieved by Adrian N. Peterson. Jerry Angelo, the Bears' general manager, had expressed interest in acquiring a new running back to revitalize the Bears' running game, which finished last in yards in the league. Upon hearing the news, Benson commented, “You all know the competition that goes on around here. It doesn’t matter to me. Maybe somebody else can get some criticism.” On June 9, 2008, Benson was released by the Bears following his second alcohol-related arrest in five weeks. In October 2009, Benson confirmed that shortly before he was released by the Bears, he had been diagnosed with Celiac disease. Cincinnati Bengals. Shortly after the grand jury failed to indict him on both incidents in Austin, Benson signed a one-year, $520,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on September 30, 2008. DeDe Dorsey was placed on injured reserve and Chris Perry was the starter. Benson's season began in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, rushing 10 times for 30 yards. He became the starting back for the Bengals in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Benson rushed 14 times for 52 yards in his first career start as a Bengal, and ran over Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, giving the Pro Bowler a concussion. In the following 35–6 loss to the Houston Texans, he totaled 49 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 20 yards. The Bengals picked up their first victory of the season in a 21–19 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Benson carrying 24 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. Benson hit his stride in the Bengals' three-game winning streak at the end of the season, gashing the Washington Redskins in week 15 with 161 all purpose yards, including 88 yards receiving (79 of which came on a screen pass). In week 16, Benson dominated the Cleveland Browns, rushing for 171 yards. In the final game of the season against Kansas City, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 all-purpose yards: 747 rushing and 185 receiving. A free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7 million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009. Entering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown. In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown. Benson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite only playing 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets. The Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2011. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: ""'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly. I don't need that anymore.'"" Green Bay Packers. On August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers. The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000. On October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve. Legal trouble. Arrests in 2008. Before the start of the 2008 season, Benson was arrested for allegedly operating a boat while intoxicated and resisting arrest. On May 3, 2008, the incident occurred near Austin, Texas by the Lower Colorado River Authority during a late night safety inspection. The official police report cited that Benson had failed a field sobriety test, and became hostile towards the police. The officers arrested Benson, and proceeded to use pepper-spray after he forcefully resisted arrest. Benson was later detained for the night, and charged with boating while intoxicated and resisting arrest. Benson has since refuted the charges against him, and stated he requested to take a follow-up field sobriety test on land after failing the initial one. Benson has further accused the officers of abusing him, stating, “I’m not handcuffed. I’m not under arrest. I’m not threatening him. I’m not pushing him. I’m not touching him. And he sprays me right in the eye.” He also asserts that officers continuously struck his ankles and feet to prevent him from walking properly. A female passenger on Benson's boat also claims to have witnessed the abuse and called her father out of fear for Benson's safety. Her fiance, also on the boat, may have dozens of pictures confirming Benson's account. Upon hearing about the incident, Bears' head coach Lovie Smith stated, “I haven’t had a chance to speak with Cedric yet, but anytime we’re talking about one of our players getting arrested, you’re disappointed in it,” and added “What we’re going to do from here, I’ll go back and try to get as much information as I possibly can and go from there.” Benson was later found innocent by an Austin grand jury. Benson was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Austin on June 7, 2008. While returning from a restaurant with his girlfriend, police claim that Benson drove through a red light, and failed a field sobriety test. Police claim he later refused to take a breath or blood test to determine his blood alcohol level. Police proceeded to detain Benson, and later released him on bond. Benson has denied the police officers' allegations, and insisted that he 'aced' the field test. Bears general manager Jerry Angelo commented, “It’s unfortunate. Disappointment is too much an often used word when we’re talking about Cedric. The No. 1 lesson for every player is protect your job. We’re all held accountable for our actions. I’m not going to say any more than that until we know for sure what the facts are.” On the following Monday, Benson was waived from the Bears. Angelo commented on the release, stating ”Cedric displayed a pattern of behavior we will not tolerate... As I said this past weekend, you have to protect your job. Everyone in this organization is held accountable for their actions."" Benson was later ordered by a county judge to put a built-in ignition interlock breathalyzer in his car. He was also told to start drug counseling classes. Benson was cleared of all charges in September, after appearing before two grand juries in Travis County. 2010 arrest.

""Montepaschi"" is an internationalized short form for the name of the club's principal sponsor, the Siena banking company ""Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena"". For past club sponsorship names, see the list below. History. The basketball club's parent multi-sports club, Polisportiva Mens Sana, founded in 1871, claims to have been the first sports club in Italy to play and organize basketball; asserting that it did so in 1907, just sixteen years after James Naismith invented the sport, in 1891. This began with the club's women's section, giving the first basketball demonstration in Italy, in 1907, led by Professor Ida Nomi Pesciolini. Nomi translated Naismith's basketball rules, but had not seen an actual demonstration of the sport before doing so. Nomi called the sport, ""Ball to the Rim"". The actual basketball department of the parent athletic club was founded in the year 1934. However, despite its long history, it was mostly a provincial side until the 1973-74 season, when it joined Italy's top division for the first time. The club moved into Palasport Mens Sana arena in 1976. The club became increasingly competitive over the years, and started to play in European-wide competitions in the 1999-2000 season, when it competed in the Korać Cup.

wikipedia-2329629," Adoni  Adoni (also known as Adhoni) is a municipality(Nagar Palika), mandal headquarters and commercial town in Kurnool district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is 180 miles (300 km) from Hyderabad and 307 miles (494 km) from Chennai by rail. The famous Mantralayam (Swami Raghavendra's mutt) is near to Adoni. It is approximately 42 km by rail. From the Railway Station, it is 16 km to Swami Raghavendra's mutt. Adoni has a population of about 2,70,247 persons (of whole Adoni Mandal). Adoni is 245th biggest city in terms of population in India. In terms of population it secured 23rd place in state according to the census of 2011. Once a stronghold of the medieval Vijayanagara Empire, today it has a substantial textile industry. The hill-fort, now in ruins, was an important seat of government in Islamic times and is frequently mentioned in the wars of the 18th century. Adoni is located in the border of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. During British period Adoni was known as Second Mumbai as it is the hub for all types of businesses. As many rice mills are sealed due to some reasons, the production of rice is reduced. But still Adoni is the richest producer of cotton and it there is a big market yard in the town and hence the town is called as the Town of Cotton or Grain Market of South India. The town enjoys a salubrious climate and has venerated monuments of all religions. It is one of the Revenue divisions in the district. Adoni is also one of the Roads and Buildings (R&B), Panchayat Raj (PR) and Rural Water Supply (RWS) division amongst three in the district. History. Adoni has undergone a number of substantial changes over the past few centuries. Emerging as a military base for the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century, the city has evolved to become a modern, manufacturing hub. Under the Vijayanagara, the city stood at the center of the consolidation of a shifting, fragmented countryside into a more structured empire. Even after the Empire fell in the 16th century, as a product of military conflicts, the city remained a core part of Southern Indian history. After the fall of Vijayanagar, Adoni was taken possession of by the Bijapur sovereigns. Adoni was under Bijapur in the period of 16th and 17th century. It was the principal fort of the Kurnool district. In the 17th century, Kurnool was under the governorship of a hereditary line of jagirdars of African origin, who were among the most powerful nobles at court. In 1683, one noble, Siddi Masud, the governor of Kurnool and regent of Sultan Sikandar Bijapuri, retired to Adoni, where he ruled independently till 1689. In that year, he surrendered to the Mughal general Anup Singh, maharaja of Bikaner. Siddi Masud is credited with improving the fort at Adoni, clearing the forest area in the vicinity of Adoni and establishing the townships of Imatiazgadh and Adilabad, and also constructing the fine Jamia Masjid. Art historian Mark Zebrowski notes in his book ""Deccani Painting"" that the capture of Adoni revealed that Siddi Masud had been an avid collector of painting, and a patron of the Kurnool school of painting. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, Adoni remained under governors appointed by the Nizams of Hyderabad. In 1760, it was held by Basalut Jung, who made it his capital. In 1786-7, Tipu Sultan besieged Adoni and after a month's siege, captured it. After his death and defeat at the hands of the English, Adoni was ceded to the English. Under British rule South India was divided into several administrative districts; Adoni fell into the district of Bellary of Madras presidency. In 1867 AD, The Adoni Municipal Council was created, along with the Bellary Municipal Council. These were the only two municipal townships in the whole of Bellary district for a long time. The city gained its present seat as part of the state of Andhra Pradesh in 1953, after the linguistic reorganization of states. On October 1, 1953, Bellary district of Madras State was divided on linguistic basis, and Adoni (along with Yemmiganur, Alur, Raayadurgam, D.Hirehaalu, Kanekallu, Bommanahaalu, and Gummagatta) were merged into Anantapuram and Kurnool district in what would later became the Andhra Pradesh state. While the city constantly shifted its governmental structure, it emerged as a trade hub as a product of its impressive bounties of grain and gold, along with cloth and textile production. Over the century, the city built up an entire industry of cotton mills, solidifying its place in the county’s modern trade economy. Today, Adoni is one of the biggest and commercial towns in Rayalaseema and also in Andhra Pradesh State. Ruins.

wikipedia-2329635," Diana Nyad  Diana Nyad (born Diana Sneed; August 22, 1949) is an American author, journalist, motivational speaker, and world record long-distance swimmer. Nyad gained national attention in 1975 when she swam around Manhattan (28 miles) and in 1979 when she swam from North Bimini, The Bahamas, to Juno Beach, Florida (102 miles). In 2013, on her fifth attempt and at age 64, she became the first person confirmed to swim from Cuba to Florida without the protection of a shark cage, swimming from Havana to Key West (110 miles). Nyad was once ranked thirteenth among U.S. women squash players. Early life and education. Nyad was born in New York City on August 22, 1949, to stockbroker William Sneed and his wife Lucy Curtis. Her father died when she was an infant and when Diana was three her mother married Aristotle Nyad, a Greek land developer who adopted Diana. The family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where she began swimming seriously in seventh grade. She was enrolled at the private Pine Crest School in the mid-1960s, swimming under the tutelage of Olympian and Hall of Fame coach Jack Nelson. She won three Florida state high school championships in the Backstroke at 100 and 200 yards (91 and 183 m). She dreamed of swimming in the 1968 Summer Olympics, but in 1966 she spent three months in bed with endocarditis, an infection of the heart, and when she began swimming again she had lost speed. After graduating from Pine Crest School in 1967, she entered Emory University, but was eventually expelled for jumping out a fourth-floor dormitory window wearing a parachute. She then enrolled at Lake Forest College in Illinois, where she played tennis for the ""Foresters"" and resumed swimming, concentrating on distance events. She soon came to the attention of Buck Dawson, director of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Florida, who introduced her to marathon swimming. She began training at his Camp Ak-O-Mak in Ontario, Canada and set a women's world record of 4 hours and 22 minutes in her first race, a 10-mile (16 km) swim in Lake Ontario in July 1970, finishing 10th overall. After graduating from Lake Forest College in 1973, with a degree in English and French, Nyad returned to south Florida to continue training with Dawson. Career. Nyad has authored three books, ""Other Shores"" (Random House: September 1978) about her life and distance swimming, ""Basic Training for Women"" (Harmony Books: 1981), and in 1999 she wrote a biography of an NFL wide-receiver ""Boss of Me: The Keyshawn Johnson Story"". She has also written for ""The New York Times"", ""Newsweek"" magazine, and other publications. Diana and her best friend Bonnie Stoll (former No. 3 in the world on the Pro Racquetball Tour) have formed a company called BravaBody which is aimed at providing online exercise advice to women over 40, with the two world-class athletes giving direct inspiration and custom-made work-outs. As of 2006, she also delivered motivational talks to groups through the Gold Star speakers agency, for a fee of between $10,000 to $15,000. Nyad formerly hosted the public radio program ""The Savvy Traveler."" In addition, she was the subject of a short documentary ""Diana"" by the digital channel WIGS in 2012. As of 2006, she was a (long-time) weekly contributor to National Public Radio's afternoon news show ""All Things Considered"" (appearing on Thursdays), as well as the ""business of sport"" commentator for American Public Media's public radio program ""Marketplace"" business news. She was also a regular contributor to the CBS News television show ""Sunday Morning"". In her 1978 autobiography Nyad described marathon swimming as a battle for survival against a brutal foe—the sea—and the only victory possible is to ""touch the other shore."" An analysis of Nyad's ability to dissociate during her marathon swims is covered by James W. Pipkin. Nyad was inducted into the United States National Women's Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. She is also an International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame Honoree (1978) and an ISHOF Al Schoenfield Media Award recipient (2002). She is a Hall of Famer at both her college, Lake Forest College in Illinois and at her high school, Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale. An independently produced documentary film, ""The Other Shore,"" was released in early 2013, some months before Nyad's first successful swim from Cuba to Florida. Distance swimming. Over two days in 1979, Nyad swam from Bimini to Florida, setting a distance record for non-stop swimming without a wetsuit that still stands today. She broke numerous world records, including the 45-year-old mark for circling Manhattan Island (7 hrs, 57 min) in 1975. Several experts who attended the 2011 Global Open Water Swimming Conference in New York City on June 17–19, 2011 expressed their strong belief that Nyad had both the physical ability and, more importantly, the positive mental stamina to be able to complete the Cuba-to-Florida swim: sports physiology studies have shown that in ""extreme"" marathon-type activities mental determination is a more important factor than the physical energy of youth. Cuba to Florida swim attempts in 2011-2013. Preparations. By early January 2010 Nyad determined to begin working out for a summer attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida. Taking up residence in the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, from January through June she began doing 8-, 10-, 12- and 14-hour swims every other week. Then she moved her training to Key West and, while waiting for favorable weather conditions she embarked on a 24-hour swim. On July 10 she chartered a 35-foot fishing vessel to take her 40 miles out to sea. At 8:19 AM she jumped overboard and began swimming back towards Key West, with the boat following her. At 8:19 AM the next day her handlers helped her back on board, still about 10 miles from land: she said she felt ""tired and dehydrated"" but still ""strong"" and ""easily able to swim another 20 hours without any problem."" On July 10, 2010, at the age of 60, she began open water training for a 60-hour, 103-mile (166 km) swim from Cuba to Florida, a task she had failed to finish thirty years previously. When asked her motivation, she replied, ""Because I'd like to prove to the other 60-year-olds that it is never too late to start your dreams."" She was scheduled to make the swim in August/September 2010, but bad weather forced her to cancel; she then planned to do the swim in July 2011. In an October 15, 2010 interview with CNN, Nyad said she was trained and ready to swim by July 23, but a record stretch of high winds and dropping water temperatures prevented her from making the attempt. While training in St. Maarten, she sat for an interview that was published March 25, 2011 by the island's online news agency, ""The Daily Herald"", remarking that ""It's a large operation, like an expedition. We've got about 25 people, navigators, managers, boat crew, weather routers, medical people, shark experts, you name it. That's the time also when the water starts to get to its hottest. I need the hottest possible ocean. As soon as we hit the right forecast, we'll be off to Havana. We won't know the exact starting point probably until the night before. And we don't know exactly where landfall will be...I'd love to wind up in Key West, but it will depend on trajectory of the Gulf Stream."" Nyad estimated that the cost of her ""expedition"" was about $500,000. Nyad moved her training site from the Caribbean island of St. Maarten to Key West, Florida, in June 2011. She was joined by key members of her support team on June 28, to wait for ideal weather conditions that typically occur only during the summer doldrums in July and August. For the marathon swim to be feasible, two main weather conditions needed to come together at the same time: a combination of low-to-light winds (to minimize sea chop), and water temperatures in the high 80s °F (high 20s/low 30s °C). These relatively ""high"" water temperatures produce a twin challenge: in the first half of her swim the warm water will dehydrate her body, while in the second half her body temperature will drop and she will face potential hypothermia. Nyad had bulked up her physique to about 150 pounds/70 kg (15 pounds/7 kg more than she weighed in 2010) to help counter the loss of body mass during her grueling swim. Nyad was escorted by a paddler in a kayak equipped with an electronic shark repellent known as a Protective Oceanic Device. To keep Nyad swimming in a straight line, her specially designed, slow-moving catamaran support boat deployed a streamer: a long pole keeps the streamer several yards away from the boat, and the streamer is designed to remain about 5 feet underwater, so that Nyad can swim above it, much like following a lane line in a swimming pool. At night, the white streamer was replaced by a string of red LED lights. Writing in her blog in July 2011, Nyad stated that the development of the submerged guide streamer, in early summer 2011, may be the single greatest aid to her marathon swim. In all of her previous swims, she had trouble keeping the support boat in sight and was prone to veer off-course. Keeping a boat headed in a straight line, in the ocean, while moving at only 1 to 2 knots is very difficult, and her catamaran is equipped with thrusters and a special sea anchor (in case of following seas) to stabilize its course. Second attempt. Some 33 years after her first attempt in 1978, Nyad entered the water again at Havana on August 7, 2011 at 7:45PM, a CNN news team on board her support ship to provide live coverage of her swim, which involved electronic ""Shark Shields"" but no shark cage. Nyad stopped her attempt early in the morning on August 9 at 12:45AM after 29 hours in the water, after encountering strong currents and winds that pushed her miles off course to the east. Nyad also said she had been suffering shoulder pain since her third hour in the water, but what made her abandon the effort was a flare-up of her asthma, such that, throughout the final hour, she could only swim a few strokes before repeatedly having to roll on her back to catch her breath.  Third attempt. On September 23, 2011, Nyad began a third attempt at the Cuba-to-Florida swim, again without a shark cage, but had to stop after about 41 hours, about 67 nautical miles through the 103-nautical-mile passage, because of jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war stings and after currents pushed her off course. Nyad's October 2011 TED talk described how box jellyfish stings on her forearm and neck caused respiratory distress that eventually caused the swim to end. Fourth attempt. On August 18, 2012, Nyad began her fourth attempt, without a protective shark cage. Nyad and her team ended the swim prematurely at 12:55 a.m. on August 21, 2012, reportedly because of two storms and nine jellyfish stings, after having covered more distance than her three previous attempts. Successful fifth attempt. On the morning of August 31, 2013, Nyad began her fifth bid to swim from Havana, Cuba to Florida, a distance of about 110 miles (177 km), accompanied by a 35-person support team, swimming without a shark cage but protected from jellyfish by a silicone mask, a full bodysuit, gloves and booties. Before reaching Florida, Nyad broke Penny Palfrey's 2012 distance record for the Cuba to Florida swim, putting Nyad closer to Key West than anyone swimming without a shark cage. At approximately 1:55 pm EDT on September 2, 2013, Nyad reached the beach in Key West, about 53 hours after she began her journey. While not directly questioning the authenticity of her story, some skeptics, including long-distance swimmers, requested the swim's GPS history, surface current, weather, and Nyad's eating and drinking data to verify that her swim was not assisted. The swim's GPS history was revealed publicly later in 2013.  Personal life. Nyad has said a factor in her determination while swimming was her anger about, and her desire to overcome, sexual abuse she said she experienced as a child. Nyad has spoken publicly about this issue. Nyad is openly lesbian. On July 8, 2011, the U.S. gay sports website CompeteNetwork reported on her plans for the 2011 Cuba-to-Florida swim, writing that "" amazing Diana Nyad is a living legend in the swim world, and a role model for the LGBT community..."" Diana today. On September 10, 2013, just a week after she finished her swim, Diana appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Diana explained to Ellen and her audience about her extensive training. Diana started her training in the Caribbean in January. Her early workouts consisted of nonstop swimming for 12 hours. She eventually worked her way up to 14 hours, 18, 20, and 24 hours. Diana talked to Ellen about what she thinks about while she swims. Diana reads Steven Hawking books, she sings, counts numbers, and has vivid hallucinations of The Wizard of Oz and the yellow brick road.  Recently, on September 24th, 2013, Nyad announced that she will be participating in ""Swim for Relief"" on October 8th through the 10th, which is a continuous, 48 hour swim in New York City's Herald Square. A 120 foot long, two lane pool will be installed in Herald Square for this event. New Yorkers will be able to gather and witness Diana Nyad's endurance directly and cheer her on. This event will raise funds for AmeriCares, and it is to support the victims of Hurricane Sandy.  "

wikipedia-2329682," Ute Lemper  Ute Lemper (born 4 July 1963) is a German singer and actress renowned for her interpretation of the work of Kurt Weill. Biography. Born in Münster, Germany, Ute Gertrude Lemper was raised in a Roman Catholic family. She joined the jazz-rock music group known as the Panama Drive Band at the age of 16. Later, she graduated from the Dance Academy in Cologne and the Max Reinhardt Seminary Drama School in Vienna. Her diverse credits include musicals, such as her breakthrough role in the original Viennese cast of ""Cats"", the title role in ""Peter Pan"", a recreation of the Marlene Dietrich-created Lola in ""The Blue Angel"", the original European Sally Bowles in a Paris production of ""Cabaret"", and Velma Kelly in ""Chicago"" (Lemper has played the role of Velma Kelly in ""Chicago"" in both London and New York. She won the Laurence Olivier Award for her performance in London). She also dubbed the singing voices of Ariel in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" and Esmeralda in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" for German-speaking audiences. However ""The Little Mermaid"" has since been redubbed for a second run in theaters in 1998, and was never released on DVD in its original German dub. A painter in the neoclassical style, Lemper's paintings have been showcased in numerous galleries. Lemper, a mother of four, resides on the Upper West Side section of Manhattan in New York City. She performs worldwide, recently in the Middle East. Her autobiography was published in Berlin in 1995. She has also authored several journal articles. Film and television work. She starred as Marie Antoinette for ""L'Autrichienne"" (1989, directed by Pierre Granier-Deferre), and subsequently appeared in films such as ""Prorva"", ""Bogus,"" ""Jean Galmot, aventurier,"" ""Prospero's Books,"" ""Appetite"" and ""Prêt-à-Porter"" (in the latter appearing in a well-publicised nude scene filmed while she was pregnant, and she received National Board of Review for Ensemble Cast award). She has contributed to the soundtracks of numerous films, including ""The Voyager"", ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" and ""Appetite."" In 2007, Lemper was a juror in Let's Dance, the German version of ""Dancing with the Stars"". Recording. Lemper, named ""Billboard's"" Crossover Artist of the Year for 1993/1994, is a prolific recording artist, appearing on numerous cast recordings and compilation concerts, including Roger Waters' ""The Wall"" concert in 1990.

wikipedia-2329693," Corcovado National Park  Corcovado National Park () is a National Park on the Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica (9° North, 83° West), which is part of the Osa Conservation Area. It was established on 24 October 1975, and encompasses an area of 425 km² (263 mi²). It is widely considered the crown jewel in the extensive system of national parks and biological reserves spread across the country. The ecological variety is quite stunning. National Geographic has called it ""the most biologically intense place on Earth in terms of biodiversity"". Not only is the park very popular with tropical ecologists, a visitor can expect to see an abundance of wildlife. One should come well prepared though (see below). The park conserves the largest primary forest on the American Pacific coastline and one of the few remaining sizeable areas of ""lowland"" tropical rainforests in the world. Logging usually takes place in lowland areas because those areas are more accessible and contain the largest and most economically valuable trees. But those habitats are also usually the richest in biodiversity. So even though still approximately half the tropical rainforests on Earth remain, what is left of the originally rich lowland tropical rainforests is usually too small to support the original natural biodiversity. Larger animals, especially, need a large habitat free of human activity. Unfortunately this means that even tourism, the economic incentive for Costa Rica and other developing nations to preserve and protect parks such as Corcovado, actually threatens the long-term biodiversity of the park. Corcovado is home to a sizable population of the endangered Baird's Tapir and even a small population of the very rare Harpy Eagle. The park's rivers and lagoons are home to populations of both the American crocodile and Spectacled Caiman, along with Bull sharks. Corcovado is also one of the final strongholds of the Jaguar within Central America and several other felines are also present, including Ocelot, Margay, Jaguarundi, and Puma. All four Costa Rican monkey species can be seen within the park, including the endangered Central American Squirrel Monkey, White-faced Capuchin, Mantled Howler, and Geoffroy's Spider Monkey. Other mammals present include Two-toed and Three-toed Sloth, Collared Peccary, Northern Tamandua and Silky Anteater. Poison dart frogs and several species of snake (including the venomous Fer-de-Lance and Bushmaster) are also common within the park. The abundance in wildlife can in part be explained by the variety of vegetation types, at least 13, including montane forest (more than half the park), cloud forest, jolillo forest (palm swamp), prairie forest, alluvial plains forest, swamp forest, freshwater herbaceous swamp and mangrove, together holding over 500 tree species, including purple heart (tree), poponjoche, nargusta, banak (tree), cow tree, espave and crabwood (tree). Another reason for the diversity (as with all of Costa Rica) is that it lies on a north-south corridor for flora and fauna; part of the ""land bridge"" and wildlife corridor that links the large continents of North America and South America. Visiting. As when visiting any sensitive natural area, please be sure to clean all of your hiking and/or camping gear (in particular shoe/boot soles and tents) prior to visiting to decrease the chance introducing non-native seeds. Corcovado National Park is open to the public and can be visited on day trips and for overnight visits. As of April 2013, admission is $10 per person per day for non-Costa Rican residents. Reservations for overnight visits in the park can be made in Puerto Jiménez on the east coast of the peninsula. One may camp or stay indoors at one of several ranger stations equipped with bunks. If one wants basic meals served, reservations should be made about a week in advance. Take note that researchers get preference over other visitors (though there is usually enough room for self-catering campers). One can make day visits into the park from several lodging options on both the north and south entrances to the park, as well as through organised excursions that fly into the park. One can get to the Corcovado National Park via Puerto Jimenez or Drake Bay. These two towns serve as the main entry points to the park. There are two tracks, one coastal and one inland, and four ranger stations in the park where one can stay overnight; three at the park entrances and one at the intersection of the two tracks. One track runs Northwest to Southeast along the coast to La Leona ecolodge, with the Estación Sirena roughly in the middle. The second track runs inland from Estacion Sirena to Estación Los Patos at the Eastern end of the park. One can fly into the park (via chartered aircraft) to Estación Sirena, from where one can follow relatively short loop-trails. Carate (near Estacion La Leona), also has an airstrip and road access from Puerto Jimenez. To walk through the park one needs a reasonable fitness, at least two or three days, good planning and caution. During the wet months (July to November) parts of the park may be closed. On the coastal track there are several rivers that need to be forded. These rivers can all be very dangerous if forded at high tide or if one is inexperienced in this kind of an environment. Rio Sirena is commonly regarded as the most dangerous of crossings, primarily because it flows directly into the massive Laguna Corcovado in the isolated heart of the park. Bull sharks are present within the river and can sometimes be seen at the river mouth during high tide. American crocodiles are also present within the river, but most are small and recent surveys indicate that the population may be much smaller than initially believed. Spectacled caiman are present further up river and within Laguna Corcovado in larger numbers. Rumors that large American crocodiles are present within Laguna Corcovado are false. The Rio Claro, which is approximately 40 minutes south of Rio Sirena, is said to be safer, although both appear to the naked eye as very similar in size. Small American crocodiles and spectacled caiman are also present within the Rio Claro, albeit in smaller numbers than Rio Sirena. Bull sharks are not believed to be present within the Rio Claro. Despite the presence of these predators, by far the greatest risk you will face while crossing any river is the strong current. Upstream Rio Claro is a popular night swimming spot amongst guides and their groups, therefore it is doubtful that attacks by crocodiles or sharks in this river are a concern. The Rio Madrigal, just north of the park entrance, is much smaller and may be home to spectacled caiman. The elusive Jaguar is a large, beautiful and potentially intimidating feline but is generally regarded as shy and harmless. They are capable of taking down prey as large as Tapir but appear to be reclusive and uninterested in human activity. Most animal sightings can be expected on the coastal track, with scarlet macaws (the largest population in the country) flying overhead, hermit crabs on the beach, pelicans fishing in the sea and, on the sections that go slightly inland, spider monkeys (take care not to get urinated on when they are in a tree overhead), tamandua anteaters, pumas, white faced capuchin monkeys, lineated woodpeckers and coatis (to name just a few). With luck one might even spot a tapir, even though they're nocturnal. Corcovado is also a good place to spot the red-eyed tree frog, as well as the glass frog with its transparent skin, and the enamel-bright poison-arrow frogs. From Estación Sirena one can follow many short tracks, on which one can also take short night-strolls into the forest with a good chance of running into a tapir. They're impressive to see but harmless if left in peace. Jaguars are present and some individuals frequent the beach near Madrigal at night. You are very likely to see their tracks, sometimes very fresh and frequent, but very unlikely to see the actual cat. The most common animal in the park is by far the White-nosed Coati, which one can expect to encounter dozens of times on the beach hike between La Leona and Sirena, digging for and feeding on the abundant Moon Crabs. The inland track to Estación Los Patos goes through secondary growth for much of the way, but it is still a beautiful walk with a little more variation and it's easier walking with no sand and no sizeable river crossings. Other animals in the park include Central American Squirrel Monkeys, mantled howler monkeys, both two-toed and three-toed sloths, agoutis, giant anteaters, Great Curassows, black hawks, Spectacled Owls, hummingbirds, 220 species of butterflies, golden orb spiders (who build huge webs), otters and raccoons. Four species of sea turtle (green, Pacific Ridley, Hawksbill, and Leatherback) nest on the beaches. Creation and threats. Because of the remoteness of the peninsula, logging started only in the 1960s. By 1975 there were plans for a major international logging operation. Researchers petitioned President Daniel Oduber to protect the area, which he did by making it a National Park. For this he received the Albert Schweitzer Award from the Animal Welfare Institute. The already present goldminers were allowed to stay. By 1986 their number had increased to about 1,000 (not counting their families), who also hunted the wildlife. It was decided to evict them. There is, however, still some illegal mining going on (using more destructive modern mining methods). Illegal logging is not frequent, but the trees that are removed are scarce and essential to the ecosystem. Increased tourism has led to an increased presence of humans in the park, which may threaten the long-term survival of the park's larger mammals. To help combat the threat of over-exposure, many agencies and other groups (including Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, WWF–U.S., rain-forest conservation groups in several countries, Catholic Relief Service, Organization of American States, and the Costa Rican, Danish, Dutch, Swedish and U.S. governments) have come together to provide aid to the conservation cause.

wikipedia-2329708," Scissor doors  Scissor doors (also beetle-wing doors, jack-knife doors, switchblade doors, Lamborghini doors, and Lambo doors) are automobile doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, rather than outwardly as with a conventional door. History. The first vehicle to feature scissor doors was the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car, designed by Bertone's Marcello Gandini. The door style was dictated by Gandini's desire for an innovative design, and by his concern over the car's extremely poor rear visibility. In order to reverse the car, the driver would be able to lift the door and lean his upper body out of the hatch in order to see behind the car. The first production car to feature the doors was a Lamborghini, Gandini's Countach; the sports car's wide chassis created similar problems to those found on the Carabo, calling for the unusual door configuration. The doors were used on the Countach's successor, the Diablo, on its replacement, the Murciélago, and on a low-production run derivative of the Murciélago called the Reventón. The Aventador is the latest Lamborghini car to feature the trademark doors. Having used the exotic door style for several of its cars, the Italian manufacturer has become synonymous with the implementation of scissor doors, which are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""Lambo doors"". Types. There are different types of scissor doors. The conventional type rotates to 90 degrees. Scissor doors can be powered and they usually are. Vertical Lift System. VLS doors have a scissor door configuration. The biggest difference is that they are designed to initially open slightly outward before opening upward to allow the top edge of the door to clear the door frame and A-pillar. Although butterfly doors also move upwards and outwards, VLS doors are not butterfly doors, this is because VLS doors move outwards to a very small degree compared to the angle of butterfly doors. 130 degrees. Although conventional scissor doors rotate to 90 degrees, some can rotate up to 130 degrees; these are commonly used for modified cars. These have the benefit that they don't obstruct the entrance or exit to the car as much as conventional scissor doors. VLS doors also can rotate to 130 degrees. Scissor-conventional door hybrid. Some aftermarket example scissor doors are also designed so they can open vertically, and horizontally like a conventional car door. These are used so the user can get the benefits of both types of door and open the door in whichever style is best suited to the situation. "
wikipedia-2329712," Gigg Lane  Gigg Lane is an all-seater football stadium in Bury, Greater Manchester, England. Historically within Lancashire, it was built for Bury F.C. in 1885, and has been their home ever since. History. The first match to be played at Gigg Lane was a friendly between Bury and Wigan on 12 September 1885, which Bury won 4–3. The first league game was a 4–2 victory over Manchester City on 8 September 1894 in the 1894–95 Football League Second Division. The stadium has had permanent floodlights since 1953, although the first floodlit match to be played there took place in 1889, before the Football League had authorised the use of floodlights in competitive matches. The capacity of the ground was once 35,000—and this capacity was reached when the record crowd was achieved for Bury's FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers on 9 January 1960. The game ended 1–1 and Bury lost the replay after extra time 4–2. In 1986, Gigg Lane saw its lowest ever crowd of just 461 for a Freight Rover Trophy game against Tranmere Rovers. There has never been a league crowd below 1,000 although the closest to that mark came in 1984 with a crowd of 1,096 against Northampton Town.  Bury F.C. own Gigg Lane outright. Structure and facilities. Gigg Lane's current capacity is 11,840. The South Stand is the largest stand and it was renamed the ""Les Hart Stand"" in the summer of 2010. The stand contains a pattern of blue and white seats that spell out """"SHAKERS"""" After the Taylor Report forced all Football League clubs to switch to all-seater stadiums, Gigg Lane began converting all four sides of the ground in 1993, with the Cemetery End being the final terraced section to be demolished in 1999. The Manchester Road End (capacity 2,100) was home to the club's electronic scoreboard (obtained from Leicester City's Filbert Street ground after it closed in 2002) until 2011. A new scoreboard was placed in the south-east corner of the ground a few months later. The Cemetery End (the east stand) has capacity of 2,500. Other users. The stadium has been used for many sports other than football, such as rugby league, cricket, baseball and lacrosse. It has also been used by football clubs other than Bury: Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers have hosted reserve-team matches at the ground. FC United of Manchester have shared the ground since the 2005–06 season, although they plan to move to their own ground for the 2014–15 season. A couple of teams have ""switched"" their home games to Gigg Lane, including Preston N.E. for a League Cup tie in 1994. Non-league sides Rossendale United and Radcliffe Borough moved home F.A. Cup ties to Gigg Lane against Bolton (in 1971) and York City respectively. In 1996, the stadium was used as the filming location for the TV film based on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, where 96 Liverpool F.C. fans died as a result of a crush on the stadium's terraces. Hillsborough Stadium was seen as an unsuitable location for the film, partly to avoid causing further distress to survivors and bereaved families, and partly because the appearance of Gigg Lane was more akin to the 1989 Hillsborough than the actual stadium was seven years after the tragedy due to redevelopment.

wikipedia-2329720," Matrigel  Matrigel is the trade name for a gelatinous protein mixture secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma cells and marketed by BD Biosciences and by Trevigen Inc under the name Cultrex BME. This mixture resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues and is used by cell biologists as a substrate for cell culture.  A common laboratory procedure is to dispense small volumes of chilled (4 °C) Matrigel onto plastic tissue culture labware. When incubated at 37 °C (body temperature) the Matrigel proteins self-assemble producing a thin film that covers the surface of the labware.  Cells cultured on Matrigel demonstrate complex cellular behavior that is otherwise difficult to observe under laboratory conditions. For example, endothelial cells create intricate spiderweb-like networks on Matrigel coated surfaces but not on plastic surfaces. Such networks are highly suggestive of the microvascular capillary systems that suffuse living tissues with blood. Hence, the process by which endothelial cells construct such networks is of great interest to biological researchers and Matrigel allows them to observe this.  In some instances researchers may prefer to use greater volumes of Matrigel to produce thick three-dimensional gels. The utility of thick gels is that they induce cells to migrate from the surface to the interior of the gel. This migratory behavior is studied by researchers as a model of tumor cell metastasis. Pharmaceutical scientists use Matrigel to screen drug molecules. A typical experiment consists of adding a test molecule to Matrigel and observing cellular behavior. Test molecules that promote endothelial cell network formation are candidates for tissue regeneration therapies whereas test molecules that inhibit endothelial cell network formation are candidates for anti-cancer therapies. Likewise, test molecules that inhibit tumor cell migration may also have potential as anti-cancer drugs. Matrigel is also commonly used to prepare human tumor xenografts in rodents as part of a cancer drug discovery program. Matrigel is mixed with immortalized human cancer cells and the mixture is injected subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. A human tumor usually forms in two to four weeks. This model system allows a researcher to test an anti-cancer compound in a surrogate host.  The ability of Matrigel to stimulate complex cell behavior is a consequence of its heterogeneous composition. The chief components of Matrigel are structural proteins such as laminin, entactin, and collagen which present cultured cells with the adhesive peptide sequences that they would encounter in their natural environment. Also present are growth factors that promote differentiation and proliferation of many cell types. Matrigel contains numerous other proteins in small amounts and its exact composition can vary from lot to lot. For this reason, Matrigel may not be appropriate for experiments which require a precise knowledge of all proteins and concentrations.  Matrigel is also used as an attachment substrate in embryonic stem cell culture. When embryonic stem cells are grown in the absence of feeder cells, extracellular matrix components such as diluted Matrigel are necessary to maintain the pluripotent, undifferentiated state (self-renewal). When used undiluted, Matrigel will promote stem cell growth and differentiation. "
wikipedia-2329733," Palisades Charter High School  Palisades Charter High School (usually abbreviated as ""Pali High,""or ""Pali,"" uncommonly as ""PCHS"" / ""PHS"" ) is a secondary school in Los Angeles, California, United States. The public high school serves the neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades, Palisades Highlands, Kenter Canyon and portions of Brentwood (including Brentwood Circle). Residents in Topanga, an unincorporated section of Los Angeles County, may attend Palisades or Taft High School. The school serves grades 9 through 12. Formerly directly administered by the Los Angeles Unified School District school, with the land still owned by the district, the school is now an independent charter school, no longer administered by LAUSD. Its current enrollment numbers 2742 students, and many of them endure long bus rides to attend one of the most highly-ranked public high schools in the Los Angeles area. In 2005, ""Pali"" was recognized as a California Distinguished School. The school is located at 15777 Bowdoin Street, Pacific Palisades, California, 90272. Paul Revere Charter Middle School feeds into Palisades. History. The school was founded in 1961. The Class of 2012 was the 50th graduating class.  Prior to the founding, the property was called All Hallows Farm and for many years was owned by the Conway family: Hollywood film director Jack Conway; his wife, actress Virginia Conway — daughter of silent screen star Francis X. Bushman — and their two sons, one of whom, Pat Conway became an actor as well. This property was subsequently rented to actress Debbie Reynolds and her husband, singer Eddie Fisher. It was then taken, some years later, by the State by eminent domain to build the high school. Several members of the class of 1965 were profiled in a ""Time"" magazine article, which led to a best-selling 1976 book by class members David Wallechinsky and Michael Medved, ""What Really Happened to the Class of '65?"". The book featured interviews with several members of the class, whose experiences were recounted both individually and in groupings around shared themes such as the Vietnam War and the draft, drug experimentation, and sex. Various teachers from the school also were interviewed, among them English teachers Miss Jean O'Brien, history teacher Mr. Johnson, and Mrs. Rose ""Mama G"" Gilbert, who recently retired after 63 years of teaching. At age 94, Mrs. Gilbert was the oldest active teacher in the LAUSD. The success of the book later inspired a short-lived television dramatic anthology series of the same title, which ran from December 1977 to July 1978 on NBC. This school was the focus of a false email chain letter started around 2002. The message falsely claimed that a satiric message to parents about student truancies and homework problems was actually on the school's answering machine. The message was originally written in response to parent outrage that students who skipped class more than ten days per 90-schoolday semester (not counting legitimate absences, like sickness) could receive a failing grade in that class. This was reported on several web sites, including TruthOrFiction.com, Snopes, and BreakTheChain.org. Disregarding a majority vote of the parents and students, which came down 1740–1010 against, the board of directors voted in 2006 to change the starting date of school for the 2007–2008 school year, which upset the student body, many of whom took action by skipping class in protest. After much disagreement among the principal, the Board, teachers, parents, and students, the school finally announced on Tuesday, May 8, that the calendar change would not be enacted, mostly due to ongoing contract discussions with United Teachers Los Angeles which reminded administrators of a clause which prevented schedule changes without teacher approval.

wikipedia-2329749," Vasculogenesis  Vasculogenesis is the process of blood vessel formation occurring by a ""de novo"" production of endothelial cells. Process. Though similar to angiogenesis, the two are different in one aspect: The term angiogenesis denotes the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, whereas vasculogenesis is the term used for the formation of new blood vessels when there are no pre-existing ones. For example, if a monolayer of endothelial cells begins sprouting to form capillaries, angiogenesis is occurring. Vasculogenesis, in contrast, is when endothelial precursor cells (angioblasts) migrate and differentiate in response to local cues (such as growth factors and extracellular matrices) to form new blood vessels. These vascular trees are then pruned and extended through angiogenesis.  Occurrences. Vasculogenesis occurs during embryologic development of the circulatory system. Vasculogenesis can also occur in the adult organism from circulating endothelial progenitor cells (derivatives of stem cells) able to contribute, albeit to varying degrees, to neovascularization. Examples of where vasculogenesis can occur in adults are: "

wikipedia-2329784," Battle of Wandiwash  The Battle of Wandiwash was a decisive battle in India during the Seven Years' War. The Count de Lally's army, burdened by a lack of naval support and funds, attempted to regain the fort at Vandavasi, now in Tamil Nadu. He was attacked by Sir Eyre Coote's forces and decisively defeated. The French general Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau and the French were then restricted to Pondichéry, where they surrendered on 16 January 1761. Wandiwash is the Anglicised pronunciation of Vandavasi. This was the Third Carnatic War fought between the French and the British. After making substantial gains in Bengal and Hyderabad, the British, after collecting huge amount of revenue, were fully equipped to face the French in Wandiwash. Thus, they defeated the French comprehensively in this Battle. According to the 19th century book (""Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century"") by Author Eduard Cust, the French Army has used 300 European Cavalry, 2250 European Infantries, 1300 Sepoys, 3000 Mahrattas with 16 pieces of Artillery and the English had used about 80 European Horses, 250 Native horses, 1900 European Infantries, 2100 Sepoys and 26 pieces of Artillery. Battle of Wandiwash involved capture of Chetpattu (Chengalpattu), Tirunomalai (Thiruvannaamalai), Tindivanam and Perumukkal. "

Eddie Villanueva.  JIL started with 15 members in 1978. As of 2010, members growth up to 6 million believers. Its world headquarters is located in Bocaue, Bulacan, Philippines. Theology. Mission of the Church. ""To bring all people to the kingdom of the living God regardless of race, status, belief and religious affiliations through the saving, healing, delivering, and transforming power of the Lord Jesus Christ."" Vision of the Church. ""A Glorious Church evangelizing and discipling Filipinos and all the peoples of the world through teaching, preaching, and living out the full Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ...""  Political involvement. In 2001, the Social Weather Stations estimated that the JIL’s voting strength was 307,000 or only 10% of its claimed membership. Today, JIL has 4 million members, Villanueva said. A week before the 1992 presidential elections, JIL Church founder Eddie Villanueva claims divine guidance to endorse Fidel Ramos. Ramos won becoming the country's first Protestant president, but his victory was tainted by allegations of wholesale cheating in Mindanao. Villanueva became his private chaplain. In 1997, Ramos unsuccessfully lobbied to amend the constitution and lift the single six-year presidential term limit. Villanueva lead the Philippines for Jesus Movement in petitioning for the change. In the 1998 Philippine presidential elections, Villanueva actively endorsed and ""anointed"" Jose de Venecia as the next president. De Venecia finished 6 million votes behind the very popular Joseph Estrada. In 1999, Villanueva along with the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, Cardinal Sin and ex-President Corazon Aquino, strongly opposed Estrada's efforts to amend the constitution. In April 2001, Estrada is arrested on plunder charges, prompting his loyalists to demonstrate. Villanueva joined Pentecostal and Catholic leaders in condemning the rally. In the 2004 Philippine presidential election, Villanueva ran for president. Villanueva presented himself as someone who wanted to fight against “moral bankruptcy” and corruption in the Philippines. His supporters include Christian showbiz personalities Piolo Pascual, Donita Rose, Gary Valenciano and Kuh Ledesma. He got 1,988,218 votes or 6.16% of the total votes. He not only lost the race but also the votes of other Christian denominations and four megachurches in the country by the likes of Rev. Butch Conde of Bread of Life Ministries International, Rev. Peter Tan-Chi of Christ's Commission Fellowship, Dr. Luis Pantoja of Greenhills Christian Fellowship and Rev. Steve Murrel of Victory Christian Fellowship that believed he shouldn’t have run and they didn't support Villanueva because of the separation of church and state. When Gloria Arroyo won the election, Villanueva rejected Arroyo's overtures to join her administration. In July 2005, Arroyo called for constitutional changes amid accusations of corruption and election manipulation. The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches supported Arroyo during impeachment investigations, while Villanueva called for Arroyo to resign. Villanueva alleges that Arroyo ordered her allies to shave off votes from him in the 2004 presidential election and transfer them to hers. Around 200,000 JIL members rallied and asked Arroyo to resign and call a snap election. In the 2010 Philippine presidential election, Villanueva ran for president again but lost receiving only 1,125,878 votes or 3.12% of the total votes. "
wikipedia-2329865," Cinelli  Cinelli () is an Italian bicycle manufacturing company based in Milan, Italy, producing mostly road bicycles and components; production is estimated at 80 percent components, 20 percent bicycles. History. Cinelli was founded in 1948 by Cino Cinelli (born Montespertoli, Italy, 9 February 1916, died 20 April 2001), a former professional road racer and president of the Italian Cyclists' Association. He was a professional racer from 1937 to 1944, winning Milan – San Remo in 1943, the Giro di Lombardia in 1938, and the Tour of the Apennines in 1937. He started a company under his name in 1948. Cinelli was the seventh of 10 children, the son of a small landowner near Florence. He became interested in bicycle technology after mechanical failures in races. Failure to interest manufacturers with his ideas in 1946 led him to start his own company. His brother Giotto was making steel stems and bars in Florence and Cinelli moved the business to Milan, centre of the Italian cycling industry. He made stems, bars and frames but depended on wholesaling for other companies. By his retirement, Cinelli's own goods were half the business. Stems and bars were 80 per cent of Cinelli's own sales.  Cinelli moved to alloy production in 1963, later than other manufacturers because he was concerned about strength. Annual production of alloy stems and bars rose from 5,000 in the 1950s, to 7,500 in the early 1960s. By 1978 the figure was 150,000.  He made no more than 700 frames a year. In 1974, he designed an aerodynamic bike on which Ole Ritter broke his own hour record. The staple product was the Super Corsa road model made from 1947. Trade mark. The Cinelli head badge was originally hand-painted. Later, it became a decal.

wikipedia-2329901," Clark Hunt  Clark Knobel Hunt (born February 19, 1965) is Chairman and CEO of the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs and a founding investor-owner in Major League Soccer. Hunt also serves as Chairman of Hunt Sports Group, where he oversees the operations of FC Dallas and, formerly, the Columbus Crew of MLS. He is the son of Lamar Hunt and the grandson of oil tycoon H.L. Hunt. Following the death of his father in 2006, Clark, his sister, and two brothers inherited ownership of the Chiefs. Clark serves as the ultimate authority as Chairman and CEO. Background. After graduating from St. Mark's School of Texas, he finished first in his class at Southern Methodist University in 1987, where he was a captain of SMU's nationally-ranked soccer team and a two-time Academic All-American. Hunt earned a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. He was a two-time recipient of the university's highest academic honor, the Provost Award for Outstanding Scholar. Hunt began his business career as an analyst with Goldman Sachs. He is married to Tavia Shackles, a former Miss Missouri Teen USA and Miss Kansas USA. The couple have three children. Involvement in professional sports. One of the driving forces behind the creation of Major League Soccer, Hunt helped his father run the Kansas City Wizards until the team was sold in 2006. Hunt remains a member of the league's Board of Governors and owns the MLS club FC Dallas.He previously owned the Columbus Crew until 2013. Kansas City Chiefs. Hunt was named Chairman of the Board of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2005. After the Chiefs' loss to the New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson announced that both he and head coach Herm Edwards would return to the Chiefs in 2008. However, Hunt declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his ""No. 1 priority"" and that ""to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.” Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager come in with a new head coach, and starting from scratch again. On December 15, Hunt announced the resignation of Carl Peterson from his positions as general manager, president, and CEO of the franchise effective the end of the season. Prior the decision, the Chiefs had a combined record of 9-24 under Hunt's leadership since December 23, 2006. The official press release stated that Peterson resigned, but Hunt had said the conversation had been on-going throughout the season. Hunt said his decision to relieve Peterson of duties was not based on what happened the previous day, when the Chiefs lost an 11-point lead in the final 73 seconds and were beaten 22–21 by San Diego, dropping their record to 2-12 on the season. Hunt also said that the fate of head coach Herm Edwards would be settled after the season when a new general manager would be hired. Hunt said he would split the duties previously held by Peterson and have someone in charge of the business side and someone else in charge of football for the franchise. Hunt had kept his search for a new general manager almost entirely leak-proof, instructing subordinates that only he is to speak to the situation. On January 13, 2009 Hunt hired New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli as the new Chiefs general manager. On January 23 the Chiefs fired head coach Herman Edwards, and Todd Haley was hired as his replacement on February 6. 2012 Season. Hunt fired Todd Haley on December 12, 2011, after the Chiefs had compiled a 5-8 record during the 2011 NFL season. Haley was replaced by defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel. Crennel finished his stint as interim head coach with a 2-1 record. On January 9, 2012, Hunt named Crennel the team's permanent head coach. The return of star players Jamaal Charles and Eric Berry led many to believe that the Chiefs would contend for a playoff spot. Instead, the Chiefs were historically bad through the first seven games of the season, failing to lead a game during regulation (worst since 1940), and holding a tie at the end of only two of twenty-eight possible quarters. Through seven games, the Chiefs were on pace to break the 1965 Pittsburgh Steelers record for worst turnover ratio by 11 turnovers. On October 28, 2012, the Chiefs lost to rival Oakland Raiders for the sixth consecutive time at home. To date, the only public comment Hunt has made during the season has been in defense of Chiefs fans, who were accused by new right tackle Eric Winston of cheering Matt Cassell's head injury during a game on October 7, 2012.  Local and national media outlets have referred to the 1-6 Chiefs' start as ""rock bottom"" and ""competing against history"". Hunt has yet to comment publicly on the Chiefs' season, though it is reported that he has spoken with several fans, and that the Chiefs have refunded tickets to holders who have complained. The Kansas City Star has referred to the season as among the worst in the history of professional sports. On January 4, 2013, The Kansas City Chiefs officially hired Andy Reid to be the next Head Coach. Columbus Crew. Under Hunt, the Columbus Crew won their first MLS Cup championship on November 23, 2008. West Ham United FC. Hunt was linked to the £120M purchase of West Ham United on August 6, 2009. However on 19 January 2010, David Sullivan and David Gold bought the east London club. Crystal Palace FC. By February 2010, rumours started to abound that Clark Hunt, was one of the interested parties looking at buying Crystal Palace FC from the administrators P&A Partnership. "
wikipedia-2329940," Beaded lizard  The beaded lizard (""Heloderma horridum"") is a species of venomous lizard found principally in Mexico and southern Guatemala. It and its congener the Gila monster (""Heloderma suspectum""), are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The beaded lizard is larger than the Gila monster but has duller coloration, black with yellowish bands of differing width depending on the subspecies. A specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is ongoing. Threatened throughout its range by overcollection and habitat loss, it is a CITES protected animal. The Motagua Valley subspecies (""H. h. charlesborgeti"") is one of the rarest lizards in the world, with a wild population of fewer than 200 animals. Taxonomy. The beaded lizard has one close living relative, the Gila monster (""H. suspectum""), as well as many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae, whose evolutionary history may be traced back to the Cretaceous period. The genus ""Heloderma"" has existed since the Miocene, when ""H. texana"" ranged over most of North America. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizard appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicates that the beaded lizard is better placed in a separate family. The species was first described in 1829 by Arend Wiegmann as ""Trachyderma horridum"", however, he renamed it ""Heloderma horridum"" six months later. Its generic name ""Heloderma"" means ""studded skin"", from the Ancient Greek words ""hêlos"" (ἧλος)—the head of a nail or stud—and ""dérma"" (δέρμα), meaning skin. Its specific name, ""Horrĭdum"", is the Latin word meaning rough or rude. There are four subspecies of beaded lizard: Description. Adult beaded lizards range from in length. It is substantially larger than the Gila monster, which only reaches lengths of . Although males are slightly larger than females, the animals are not sexually dimorphic. Both males and females are stocky with broad heads, although the males tend to be broader. The beaded lizard's scales are small, bead-like, and not overlapping. Except for the underside of the animal, the majority of its scales are underlaid with bony osteoderms. Their base color is black and marked with varying amounts of yellow spots or bands, with the exception of ""H. h. alvarezi"", which tends to be all black in color. The beaded lizard has a short tail which is used to store fat so the animal can survive during months of estivation. Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and cannot grow back if broken. The beaded lizard has a forked, black tongue which it uses to smell, with the help of a Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted. Habitat and range. The beaded lizard is found in the Pacific drainages from southern Sonora to southwestern Guatemala and two Atlantic drainages, from central Chiapas to southeastern Guatemala. Their habitats are primarily tropical deciduous forests and thorn scrub forests, but are found in pine-oak forests, with elevations from sea level to 1500 m. In the wild, the animals are only active from April to mid-November, spending about an hour per day above the ground. The nominate subspecies ""H. h. horridum"" is found in Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (""H. h. exasperatum"") is found from southern Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The black beaded lizard ("" H. h. alvarezi"") is found in the northern Chiapas and the depression of the Río Lagartero in Huehuetenango to northwestern Guatemala. The ranges of these three subspecies overlap, making them sympatric. The Motagua Valley subspecies (""H. h. charlesbogerti"") is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (""H. h. alvarezi"") by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Motagua Valley beaded lizard is the most endangered of the subspecies if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the Río Motagua in northeastern Guatemala; less than 200 0f these animals are believed to exist in the wild. Ecology. Diet. The beaded lizard is a specialized vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs. A semiarboreal species, it is found climbing deciduous trees in search of prey when encountered above ground. It will occasionally prey upon small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, and insects. Steve Angeli and Robert Applegate, noted captive breeders of the beaded lizard, have remarked that captive specimens, both wild-caught and captive-born, will often refuse any food, except for eggs. Venom. The venom glands of the beaded lizard are modified salivary glands located in the animal's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading to the base of its grooved teeth. When biting, the beaded lizard hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The beaded lizard's venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented bites (eight in the past 100 years) have resulted from prodding captive animals with a finger or bare foot. While invertebrates are essentially immune to the effects of this venom, effects on vertebrates are more severe and varied. In mammals such as rats, major effects include a rapid reduction in carotid blood flow followed by a marked fall in blood pressure, respiratory irregularities, tachycardia, and other cardiac anomalies, as well as hypothermia, edema, and internal hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, eyes, liver, and kidneys. In humans, the effects of bites are associated with excruciating pain that may extend well beyond the area bitten and persist up to 24 hours. Other common effects of bites on humans include local edema (swelling), weakness, sweating, and a rapid fall in blood pressure. Beaded lizards are immune to the effects of their own venom. The compounds in its saliva which have been studied have pharmacological properties relating to diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and even HIV. This hormone was named exendin-3 and is marketed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals as the drug exenatide. One study reported in 1996 revealed that it binds to cell receptors from breast cancer cells and may stop the growth of lung cancer cells. Reproduction. The beaded lizard becomes sexually mature at six to eight years of age and mates between September and October. Males engage in ritual combat that often lasts several hours; the victor mates with the female. The female lays her clutch of two to 30 eggs between October and December, the clutch hatching the following June or July. Young lizards are seldom seen. They are believed to spend much of their early lives underground, emerging at two to three years of age after gaining considerable size. Conservation. The beaded lizard is surrounded by myth and superstition in much of its native range. It is incorrectly believed, for example, that the lizard is more venomous than a rattlesnake, that it can cause lightning strikes with its tail, or make a pregnant woman miscarry by merely looking at it. As a result of this superstition, locals often kill the lizard on sight.  The seldom seen lizard is poached for resale through the illegal exotic animal trade. It does not reproduce well in captivity, and its scarcity means a high price for collectors. As a direct result, the beaded lizard is protected by Mexican law under the category A (Threatened), and it dwells within the range of several protected areas. In Guatemala it is protected by national legislation, and part of their range is within protected areas. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.  Fewer than 200 individual animals remain in the dry forest habitat of the Motagua Valley and this subspecies of beaded lizard (""Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti"") was facing extinction due to local extermination and loss of habitat for agricultural purposes. A conservation effort has been launched known as Project Heloderma in order to preserve the semi-arid habitat of the Motagua Valley by The Nature Conservancy and partners such as ZOOTROPIC, CONAP, the IRCF (International Reptile Conservation Foundation), Lincoln Park Zoo, Zoo Atlanta, and the San Diego Zoo. This effort has been successful in getting the Guatemalan government to list the beaded lizard under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as an Appendix I animal, making it illegal to export the species.

wikipedia-2329949," Type 89 grenade discharger  The , inaccurately and colloquially known as a knee mortar by Allied forces, is a Japanese grenade launcher or light mortar that was widely used in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. Background. The Japanese Army, noting that grenades were short-ranged weapons, began efforts to optimize these weapons for close-in infantry fighting. After studying employment of grenades and mortars on the battlefield, the Japanese Army developed hand grenades, rifle grenades, and grenade/mortar shell dischargers (small mortars) suited to warfare in typical short-range combat environments such as urban, trench, and jungle warfare.  As part of this effort, the Japanese Army had adopted by 1932 a set of fragmentation grenades with almost universal adaptability. The Type 91 fragmentation grenade could be thrown by hand, fired from a spigot-type launcher, or used in a mortar-like grenade discharger, the Type 89. Design and operation. The Type 89 entered service in 1929, and differs from the earlier Type 10 Grenade Discharger in that it has a rifled barrel. The Type 89 could fire two types of grenades or shells: the Type 91 Grenade, which was a normal infantry fragmentation grenade adapted to the Type 89 discharger, and the Type 89 50 mm shell, which was an impact-detonated shell with considerably more explosive power.  When fired from the Type 89 discharger, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade was fitted with a propellant base and time fuse. It did not explode upon contact, but was designed to ignite its fuse while in flight. A weak creep spring inside the grenade firing mechanism allowed the firing pin to be thrown back upon launching, igniting a time fuse with a 7-8 second delay. Using this system, the Type 91 grenades could be launched right through jungle cover or through small openings without the danger of premature detonation in the event the grenade struck an object on its way to the target. Although the Type 89 could be fired by a single person, it was typically operated with a crew of 3, enabling it to reach a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute. The Type 89 discharger could also be used with a more powerful impact-detonated shell approaching the power of a light mortar. Weighing approximately two pounds, it was known as the Type 89 50mm shell, and was made in high explosive (HE), incendiary, and smoke variants. To fire the shell (which had a nose-mounted impact fuse that detonated on contact), it was dropped base-down inside the tube of the discharger. By setting the Type 89 discharger at a fixed angle of 45 degrees, and varying distance to target by adjusting the size of a variable chamber space inside the discharger mechanism, Japanese soldiers could adjust fire onto multiple targets at varying ranges while firing the contact-detonated 50 mm shell through a single small clearing in the jungle canopy. The method worked equally well when firing from deep trenches or pits, or between various building obstructions when fighting inside a built-up town or city. With its curved support plate, the Type 89 was designed to be placed on the ground or against a log or trunk at a fixed firing angle of 45 degrees. However, since it used a spring-loaded, lanyard-operated firing pin mechanism, in an emergency it could fire grenades or shells at point targets while braced horizontally against a tree or building. Combat use. The Type 89 discharger first saw service in China and Manchuria. During World War II, the weapon was used in Burma, China, and the Pacific islands. The Japanese Navy paratroopers carried special containers for the Type 89 clipped to their harnesses to provide fire support right on the landing zone. Allied troops soon learned to hit the ground when they heard the telltale 'pop' of the weapon launching its grenades or shells, in some cases from more than 200 yards (183 m) away. Some Allied infantrymen mistakenly assumed that the launcher's curve plate was propped on the leg to fire and thereafter referred to it as a ""knee mortar"". However, any soldier or marine who tried to fire a captured Type 89 in this fashion received a severe bruise (and sometimes a broken thigh bone) from the hefty recoil.  The Type 89 discharger and its ammunition was responsible for many Chinese and later, Allied casualties after the start of World War II. After World War II the Type 89 was used by Indonesian National Army and militias against Dutch forces in the Indonesian National Revolution, with copies of the weapon manufactured in Demakijo, Yogyakarta.

wikipedia-2329964," Tunes of Glory  Tunes of Glory is a 1960 British drama film directed by Ronald Neame, based on the novel and screenplay by James Kennaway. The film is a ""dark psychological drama"" focusing on events in a Scottish Highland regimental barracks in the period following World War II. It stars Alec Guinness and John Mills, and features Dennis Price, Kay Walsh, John Fraser, Susannah York, Duncan MacRae and Gordon Jackson. Writer Kennaway served with the Gordon Highlanders, and the title refers to the bagpiping that accompanies every important action of the regiment. The original pipe music was composed by Malcolm Arnold, who also wrote the music for ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". The film was generally well received by critics, the acting in particular garnering praise. Kennaway's screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Plot. The film opens in a Battalion officers' mess of an unnamed Highland Regiment in the early post-war era. Major Jock Sinclair (Alec Guinness) announces that this will be his last day as Commanding Officer. Sinclair, who had been in command since the battalion's colonel was killed in action during the North African campaign in Second World War, is to be replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Basil Barrow (John Mills). Although Major Sinclair led the battalion through the rest of the war, Brigade HQ considered Barrow to be a more appropriate peacetime commanding officer. Barrow arrives early and observes the battalion's officers (including Sinclair) dancing rowdily. Barrow and Sinclair briefly swap their respective military backgrounds. Sinclair joined the regiment as an enlisted bandsman and rose through the ranks, winning the Military Medal and Distinguished Service Order in the war. Barrow by contrast came to the regiment directly from Oxford University, his ancestors having been colonel of the regiment before him – although he served only for a year with the regiment back in 1933 before being posted to ""special duties"". When Sinclair humorously tells of the time he was briefly thrown in Barlinnie Prison for being drunk and disorderly (also in 1933), Barrow rather reticently mentions his own experience as a prisoner in a Japanese POW camp. Sinclair dismissively presupposes Barrow received preferential treatment being an officer (""officer's privileges and amateur theatricals"") and sat out the war. But in fact Barrow is deeply psychologically scarred after being tortured by the Japanese but does not tell this to Sinclair who privately resents the fact that he is being replaced by a ""stupid wee man"". Meanwhile Morag (Susannah York), Sinclair's daughter, is observed illicitly meeting an enlisted piper. Barrow immediately passes several orders designed to instil discipline in the battalion that Sinclair had allowed to slip. Particularly controversial is an order that all officers take lessons in Highland dancing in an effort to make their customary rowdy style more formal and suitable for mixed company. However the unchanged energetic dancing of the officers, led by a drunken Sinclair at Barrow's first cocktail party with the townspeople, incites his anger. An outburst by Barrow only further damages his own authority. Tensions come to a head when Major Sinclair publicly assaults the uniformed piper he discovers with his daughter – ""bashing a corporal"" as he put it. Barrow decides an official report must be made, meaning an imminent court-martial, even though he is aware the action will further erode his popularity and authority within the battalion. Barrow is eventually persuaded to back down by Sinclair, even though he was guilty of striking an NCO and deserved to be court-martialled. The decision further undermines his authority, Sinclair along with other officers, notably Captain Alec Rattray (Richard Leech), treat him with a renewed lack of respect. Barrow then discovers other senior officers believe it is Sinclair who is really running the battalion, because he forced Barrow to dismiss the charges against him. Realising that his authority will never be accepted, Barrow shoots himself in the head. With the colonel's death, Sinclair realises he is to blame. He calls the officers to a meeting and announces plans for a grandiose funeral fit for a field marshal, complete with a march through the town in which all the ""tunes of glory"" will be played by the pipers. When it is pointed out how out disproportionate the plans are to the circumstances, especially given the manner of the colonel's death, Sinclair insists that it was not suicide but murder! He tells everyone he himself was the murderer and the other senior officers were his accomplices with the exception of the colonel's adjutant. Minutes later, Sinclair suffers a nervous breakdown and is escorted from the barracks while the officers and men salute as he passes. Production. ""Tunes of Glory"" was shot at Shepperton Studios in London. Establishing location shots were done at Stirling Castle in Stirling, Scotland.Stirling Castle is the Regimental Headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders which was the actual location but in fact James Kennaway served with the Gordon Highlanders. Although the production was initially offered broad co-operation to film within the castle from the commanding officer there, as long as it didn't disrupt the regiment's [Argyll's] routine, after seeing a lurid paperback cover for Kennaway's book, that co-operation evaporated, and the production was only allowed to shoot distant exterior shots of the castle. Director Ronald Neame worked with Guinness on ""The Horse's Mouth"" (1958), and a number of other participants were also involved in both films, including actress Kay Walsh, cinematographer Arthur Ibbetson and editor Anne V. Coates. Awards and honours. James Kennaway, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but lost to ""Elmer Gantry"". It also received numerous BAFTA nominations, including Best Film, Best British Film, Best British Screenplay and Best Actor nominations for both Guinness and Mills. The film was the official British entry at the 1960 Venice Film Festival, and John Mills won the Best Actor award there. That same year the film was named ""Best Foreign Film"" by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Adaptations. ""Tunes of Glory"" was adapted for the stage by Michael Lunney, who directed a production of it which toured England in 2006. Home video.

Mandl was a prominent fascist, but rather attached to the Austrofascism and Italian varieties than to Nazism. In the 1930s he became close to Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the commander of the Austrian fascist private army (""Heimwehr"") leader, whom he furnished with weapons and ammunition. From 1933 to 1937, Mandl was married to Jewish actress Hedwig ""Hedy"" Kiesler, who would later become known as Hedy Lamarr in Hollywood. Mandl is rumoured to have attempted to bring a halt to her acting career and to purchase all copies of her infamous film ""Ecstasy"" (1933), in which she appeared nude. Following incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany with the Anschluss of 1938, Mandl's remaining property which had not yet been transferred to Swiss ownership was seized, since he had supported the separatist Austrofascism and his father was Jewish. Despite Mandl's Jewish heritage, his then-wife Hedy Lamarr wrote in her autobiography 'Ecstasy and Me' that both Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German dictator Adolf Hitler attended Mandl's parties. Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling, and wrote that she escaped only by disguising herself as a maid and fleeing to Paris, where she obtained a divorce. Until 1940, Mandl tried to establish contact with Hermann Göring's office in order to supply Germany with iron. Mandl later moved to Brazil and then to Argentina, where he became a citizen and remarried. In Argentina he served as an advisor to Juan Perón and attempted a new role as film producer. He also founded a new airplane manufacturing firm, Industria Metalúrgica y Plástica Argentina. Mandl became a leading member of Argentina's social circles. He acquired homes in Mar del Plata a castle in Córdoba and a small hotel in Buenos Aires. He worked closely with French designer Jean-Michel Frank who was then artistic director of Comte S.A. who produced most of Mandl's furnishings. After the war, he returned to Austria. Mandl's last of several marriages was to Monika Brücklmeier, daughter of Eduard Brücklmeier, an accessory executed for his involvement in the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. "

wikipedia-2343711," Munchkin Country  Munchkin Country (or Munchkinland in the 1939 film and its imitators) is the eastern region (though some maps have it on the westside as described here West and East) in the fictional Land of Oz in L. Frank Baum's Oz books, first described in ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". In ""Wizard"", it was originally called ""the land of Munchkins"", and ""Munchkin Country"" in all subsequent Oz books. It is often referred to as ""Munchkinland"", a name which was introduced in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"". Munchkin Country is linked to the Emerald City by means of the yellow brick road. The inhabitants of Munchkin Country are called Munchkins. Dorothy attends a celebration at the mansion of Boq, the wealthiest man in the vicinity. ""Munchkin"" does not necessarily mean someone of short stature. Many Munchkins portrayed in the books are of normal height, most notably Nick Chopper (also known as the Tin Woodman). Classic books. Munchkin Country is distinguished by the color blue, which is worn by most of the Munchkins, as well as the color of their surroundings. While the Eastern part of the Munchkin Country is described as rich, beautiful, fertile and pleasant, and inhabited by friendly people, the Western part of the province (i.e., the region bordered by a large forest and the area surrounding the Emerald City) is wild, rough and dangerous. Certain areas of this land are densely forested, and inhabited by ferocious beasts. Munchkin Country is the site where Dorothy Gale's house lands after being carried to Oz by a cyclone. Munchkin Country's ruler was the Wicked Witch of the East but upon Dorothy's arrival in Oz, she is eliminated when the house lands on top of her, causing much celebration among the Munchkins. Princess Ozma's party visited the King of the Munchkins on their return from the Dominions of the Nome King, and found Jinjur working in his employ. This king also appears briefly in ""The Road to Oz"". Subsequent ""Oz"" books. Ruth Plumly Thompson's books identify the king of the Munchkin Country as Cheeriobed. He rules from the Sapphire City in the Ozure Isles, with his wife, Queen Orin, and son, Prince Philador. He is introduced by name in ""The Giant Horse of Oz"" and makes a subsequent appearance in ""The Wishing Horse of Oz"". John R. Neill's Oz books name the Scarecrow as king of the Munchkins, although this contradicts the previous books. He is never shown in this capacity; he is simply stated to be so. Modern works. In Gregory Maguire's novels, """" and ""Son of a Witch"" (which use ""Munchkinland""), the characters are not all Munchkins, and so they are actually called Munchkinlanders. In these books (unlike the more famous movie), Munchkins are generally shorter than average height, though the more powerful families, as Frexspar said, ""married into some height along the way."" Maguire portrays Munchkinland as the corn belt of Oz. Munchkinland is also shown to be the native home of Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and her younger sister Nessarose (although in the novel, they grew up in Quadling Country). In the Broadway musical ""Wicked"", based on the novel, their father is the governor of Munchkinland. In both adaptations, Nessarose eventually comes to power but her corrupt rule earns her loathing by the Munchkinlanders and the name, ""Wicked Witch of the East"". "
wikipedia-2343714," Antihumanism  In social theory and philosophy, antihumanism (or anti-humanism) is a theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about humanity and the human condition. Central to antihumanism is the view that concepts of ""human nature"", ""man"", or ""humanity"", should be rejected as historically relative or metaphysical. Origins. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the philosophy of humanism was a cornerstone of the Enlightenment. From the belief in a universal moral core of humanity it followed that all persons are inherently free and equal. For liberal humanists such as Kant, the universal law of reason was a guide towards total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. Criticism of humanism being over-idealistic swiftly began in the 19th Century. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than an empty figure of speech - a secular version of theism. He argues in ""Genealogy of Morals"" that human rights exist as a means for the weak to constrain the strong; as such, they deny rather than facilitate emancipation of life. Nevertheless the author Claude Pavur in a book called ""Nietzsche Humanist"" argues that ""there are excellent ground for reading Nietzsche first and foremost as a humanist"".  The young Karl Marx is sometimes considered a humanist, as opposed to the mature Marx who became more forceful in his criticism of human rights as idealist or utopian. Given that capitalism forces individuals to behave in a profit-seeking manner, they are in constant conflict with one another, and are thus in need of rights to protect themselves. Human rights, Marx believed, were a product of the very dehumanisation they were intended to oppose. True emancipation, he asserted, could only come through the establishment of communism, which abolishes the private ownership of all means of production. In the 20th century, the view of humans as rationally autonomous was challenged by Sigmund Freud, who believed humans to be largely driven by unconscious irrational desires. Martin Heidegger viewed humanism as a metaphysical philosophy that ascribes to humanity a universal essence and privileges it above all other forms of existence. For Heidegger, humanism takes consciousness as the paradigm of philosophy, leading it to a subjectivism and idealism that must be avoided. Like Hegel before him, Heidegger rejected the Kantian notion of autonomy, pointing out that humans were social and historical beings, as well as Kant's notion of a constituting consciousness. Heidegger nevertheless retains links both to humanism and to existentialism despite his efforts to distance himself from both in the ""Letter on Humanism"" (1947). Positivism and ""Scientism"". Positivism is a philosophy of science based on the view that in the social as well as natural sciences, information derived from sensory experience, and logical and mathematical treatments of such data, are together the exclusive source of all authoritative knowledge. Positivism assumes that there is valid knowledge (truth) only in scientific knowledge. Obtaining and ""verifying"" data that can be received from the senses is known as empirical evidence. This view holds that society operates according to general laws like the physical world. Introspective and intuitional attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. Though the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of Western thought, the concept was developed in the modern sense in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, Auguste Comte. Comte argued that society operates according to its own quasi-absolute laws, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws of nature. Humanist thinker Tzvetan Todorov has identified within modernity a trend of thought which emphasizes science and within it tends towards a deterministic view of the world. He clearly identifies positivist theorist Auguste Comte as an important proponent of this view. For Todorov ""Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which ""knows"" better than he does."" The autonomy of the will is maintained, but it is the will of the group, not the person...scientism has flourished in two very different political contexts...The first variant of scientism was put into practice by totalitarian regimes."" A similar criticism can be found in the work associated with the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of 'scientism'; or science ""as ideology"". Jürgen Habermas argues, in his ""On the Logic of the Social Sciences"" (1967), that ""the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only hermeneutically ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone."" Structuralism. Structuralism was developed in post-war Paris as a response to the perceived contradiction between the free subject of philosophy and the determined subject of the human sciences; and drew on the systematic linguistics of Saussure for a view of language and culture as a conventional system of signs ""preceding"" the individual subject's entry into them. Lévi-Strauss in anthropology systematised a structuralist analysis of culture in which the individual subject dissolved into a signifying convention; the semiological work of Roland Barthes (1977) decried the cult of the author and indeed proclaimed his death; while Lacan's structuralist psychoanalysis inevitably led to a similar diminishment of the concept of the autonomous individual: ""man with a discourse on freedom which must certainly be called delusional...produced as it is by an animal at the mercy of language"". Taking a lead from Brecht's twin attack on bourgeois ""and"" socialist humanism, Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser coined the term ""antihumanism"" in an attack against Marxist humanists, whose position he considered a revisionist movement. Althusser considered ""structure"" and ""social relations"" to have primacy over individual consciousness, opposing the philosophy of the subject. For Althusser, the beliefs, desires, preferences and judgements of the human individual are the product of social practices, as society moulds the individual in its own image through its ideologies.  For Marxist humanists such as Georg Lukács, revolution was contingent on the development of the class consciousness of an historical subject, the proletariat. In opposition to this, Althusser's antihumanism downplays the role of human agency in the process of history. Post-structuralism and deconstruction. Post-structuralists such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida rejected structuralism's insistence on fixed meaning, its privileging of a meta-linguistic standpoint; but continued all the more to problematize the human subject, favouring the term ""the decentered subject"" which implies the absence of human agency. Derrida, arguing that the fundamentally ambiguous nature of language makes intention unknowable, attacked Enlightenment perfectionism, and condemned as futile the existentialist quest for authenticity in the face of the all-embracing network of signs. He stressed repeatedly that ""the subject is not some meta-linguistic substance or identity, some pure ""cogito"" of self-presence; it is always inscribed in language"". Foucault challenged the foundational aspects of Enlightenment humanism, as well as their strategic implications, arguing that they either produced counter-emancipatory results directly, or matched increased 'freedom' with increased and disciplinary normatization. His anti-humanist scepticism extended to attempts to ground theory in human feeling, as much as in human reason, maintaining that both were historically contingent constructs, rather than the universals humanism maintained. Cultural examples. With greater life-experience, however, she comes closer to accepting that post-structuralism is an intriguing philosophical game, but probably meaningless to those who have not yet even gained awareness of Humanism itself.

The game's protagonist is a young man named Alundra, who learns that he has the power to enter people's dreams. He is shipwrecked near the village of Inoa and proceeds to try to help the locals, who have been suffering from a terrible curse. The narrative becomes gradually darker and more twisted as the game progresses. There is an emphasis on puzzle solving. A sequel entitled """" was released in 1999. Gameplay. Alundra is considered a spiritual sequel to Climax Entertainment's ""Landstalker"" on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. In addition to a similar looking main character, the game's development team consisted of former employees of Climax Entertainment. The gameplay style is top-down action-adventure and is known for containing many extremely difficult puzzles, some of which cannot be accessed if the player progresses further in the game, making some items unattainable. It is also known for its music and dark storyline. A range of terrain and surfaces also add variety, from sand, which causes the player to move more slowly, to lava, which damages the player. Upgrades throughout the game can help the player to overcome many of these obstacles, encouraging exploration. Story. Alundra, the protagonist and player character, is an elf from the clan of Elna, the Dreamwalkers. He comes to Inoa because of a recurring dream in which a mysterious figure who calls Alundra ""Releaser"" tells him that he must save the villagers from the evil of Melzas. His ship is caught in a storm and he is later found washed ashore unconscious. After arriving, he starts being blamed by the townsfolk for all of the terrible happenings that occur. Alundra is a silent protagonist. Alundra has drifted to a beach, where a man named Jess finds and rescues him. Jess carries Alundra to his house at village Inoa and lets him sleep in his guest room. In the village, Alundra discovers he is a Dreamwalker and helps the villagers get rid of the nightmares that have been possessing them. Since Alundra's arrival, bad things have started to happen in the village, and some of the people blame Alundra for them. Later in the game, however, it is revealed that the demon, Melzas, has disguised himself as a god, and he is the source of all the nigthmares of the village. His goal is to make the villagers pray for their god, and thus gaining power from their prayers. Ronan, the priest of the village, was also on the side of Melzas and helped him to deceive the villagers. Another dreamwalker, Meia, from the clan Elna arrives to the city and helps Alundra fight off the nightmares of the villagers, while he gathers the information and items needed to access Melzas' palace and eventually kill the demon. Development. It was published in America by the now-defunct Working Designs.

wikipedia-2343789," Armenian Highland  The Armenian Highland (for names in other languages see below; also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus that together form the northern sector of the Middle East. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and rises to an average height of . In Armenia, the average height rises dramatically from to . To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly to an average to above sea level. During Antiquity, it was known as Armenia Major, a central region to the Armenian civilization, and one of the three geo-political regions associated with Armenians, the other two being Armenia Minor and Sophene. During the Middle Ages, Turkmen invaders settled in large numbers in the Armenian Highlands. Due to this, the region was also sometimes referred to as Turcomania. The region was historically inhabited by Hurro-Urartians, Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Kurds, Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turks and Mongols. The Christian population of the Western half of the region was exterminated in an event known as the Armenian Genocide. Today, the region is mainly inhabited by Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Kurds and Turks. Name. Political aspect. When the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923, the Republic of Turkey was established. It is claimed that in its attempts to Turkify the geographical and settlement names in Turkey, the authorities of the republic began a systematic campaign to alter non-Turkish placenames. These attempts included the name change of the geographical expression of ""Armenia"" or ""Armenian plateau"" to ""Eastern Anatolia."" However, as can be seen in Turkish sources, the names Armenian plateau (Ermenistan Platosu) or Armenian Highland (Ermenistan Yaylası) are used to define the plateau. The term ""Eastern Anatolia Region"" is designated for the region and is mainly used for statistical purposes, while geographic expression Armenian plateau is continued to be used in contemporary Turkish sources. Geography. Its total area is about 400,000 km². Historically, the Armenian highland has been the scene of great volcanic activity. Geologically recent volcanism on the area has resulted in large volcanic formations and a series of massifs and tectonic movement has formed the three largest lakes in the Highland, Lake Sevan, Lake Van and Lake Urmia. The Armenian Highland is rich in water resources. Most of the Armenian Highland is in Turkey's Eastern Anatolia Region, and also includes northwestern Iran, all of Armenia, and western Azerbaijan. Its eastern parts are also known as Lesser Caucasus, which is a birthplace of Armenian people. History. From 4,000 B.C. to 1,000 B.C., tools and trinkets of copper, bronze and iron were commonly produced in this region and traded in neighboring lands where those metals were less abundant. It is also traditionally believed to be one of the possible locations of the Garden of Eden. The Armenian Plateau has been called the ""epicenter of the Iron Age"", since it appears to be the location of the first appearance of Iron Age metallurgy in the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Early Iron Age, the kingdom of Ararat controlled much of the region. In Gilgamesh, the land of Aratta is placed in a geographic space that could be describing the Armenian plateau. Throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Armenian Highland was a heavily contested territory of the Byzantine, the Ottoman, the Persian, and Arab spheres of influence. It was finally conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, and during the 19th century, it was the boundary of the Ottoman and the Russian spheres of influence. According to Richard Hovannisian, the Armenian Genocide was the ""physical elimination of the Armenian people and most of the evidence of their ever having lived on the great highland called the Armenian Plateau, to which the perpetrator side soon assigned the new name of Eastern Anatolia"". Since the Armenian Genocide and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, it has been the boundary region of Turkey, Iran and the Soviet Union and, since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia, and parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan. Flora and fauna. The apricot was known by the Romans as the ""prunus armenicus"" (the Armenian plum) and was brought to Europe from the Armenian plateau. "

wikipedia-2343805," Adrian Chiles  Adrian Chiles (born 21 March 1967) is a British television and radio presenter, currently working for ITV Sport presenting football coverage. His journalistic training and love of football resulted in the development of a career in two streams of broadcasting when he was at the BBC: fronting general and notably business programmes such as ""The One Show"", ""Working Lunch"" and ""The Money Programme""; and sports programmes like ""Match of the Day 2"". His radio programme ""Chiles on Saturday"" for Radio 5 Live was awarded the sports category Gold Medal at the ""Sony Radio Academy Awards"" in 2002. Early life and career. Chiles was born in Quinton, Birmingham, to an English father and Croatian mother, and moved a few miles away to Hagley, Worcestershire at age four. A feature of his presentations is his Birmingham accent. He also speaks Croatian, despite having a self-confessed imperfect understanding of the language's verbs, declensions, and cases. Chiles started his education at Haybridge High School, and then worked in his father's scaffolding business, before graduating with a degree in English literature from the University of London (studying at Westfield College, now part of Queen Mary, University of London).  Before going to university he was a keen amateur actor, appearing in the Crescent Theatre's (Birmingham) production of Mary O'Malley's ""Once A Catholic"" and Sandy Wilson musical ""The Cheese"". After university, while waiting for his broken leg to heal from an amateur football incident he applied for and failed both Civil Service exams, before being asked to apply for MI5 — he failed the second interview. Chiles studied journalism at Cardiff and then worked, at one time, as a sports reporter for the ""News of the World"". BBC career. Chiles joined the BBC, originally for work experience on ""Business Breakfast"". Radio. Chiles then became an assistant producer and, by 1993, was presenting Radio 4's ""Financial World Tonight"".  He began presenting and producing his own show ""Chiles on Saturday"" for Radio 5 Live, which was awarded the sports category Gold Medal at the ""Sony Radio Academy Awards"" in 2002. Television. Chiles' experience from ""Financial World Tonight"" led to him fronting the BBC Two business show ""Working Lunch"", where he came to popular notice.  He has since created, scripted and fronted a variety of other programmes for the BBC, including for BBC Two the 2003 series ""So What Do You Do All Day?"", a look at the lives of the rich and famous, and ""Asian Millionaires"". For BBC One he created and fronted ""Royal Millions"", an investigation of the Queen's finances, as well as reports for ""Panorama"" and various documentaries.  From 2006-2009, Chiles presented the spin-off series of the popular UK television show ""The Apprentice"" called """", in which he interviews the latest candidate to be fired. He left the BBC in 2009, and was replaced by Dara Ó Briain. During August 2006 Chiles co-presented a pilot of a new BBC One early-evening magazine programme, ""The One Show"". The programme was re-commissioned for 2007 with Chiles returning as host, leaving ""Working Lunch"". Chiles' last appearance on ""The One Show"" was on 30 April 2010 and his favourite guest from the programme rock singer Robert Plant appeared again. His final show also saw video tributes to an emotional Chiles from Prime Minister Gordon Brown and political leaders David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In April 2007, Chiles was a guest host of BBC One's popular satirical news quiz, ""Have I Got News for You"". He stated that he is frequently mistaken for author and presenter Ray Mears. BBC Sport. When the BBC won back the rights to Premier League football, Chiles became the host of ""Match of the Day 2"" on Sundays. In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, he was an integral part in BBC Three's African Cup of Nations coverage. He was also a member of the BBC's World Cup team often bringing viewers late night highlights. He was a main presenter of the BBC's Euro 2008 coverage and was one of the anchors of the morning 2008 Olympics coverage from Beijing. Departure to ITV. After news media speculation suggesting that the BBC wished to increase the popularity of ""The One Show"" on Fridays by introducing Chris Evans alongside Christine Bleakley in an extended one-hour format, Chiles was said to be discussing a contract with ITV. After Evans was confirmed as the new Friday presenter in a revamped one-hour format, Chiles left the BBC for ITV in a four year contract, speculated to be worth £1million per year. Chiles left the BBC on 30 April 2010.  From May 2010, Chiles has fronted ITV's football coverage. He made his ITV debut on 24 May 2010, presenting the England v Mexico friendly at Wembley (England won the match 3-1).  On 6 September 2010 he made his first appearance on ""Daybreak"", ITV's new breakfast television programme. The show failed to capture a larger market share than its competitor BBC Breakfast, and on 18 November 2011 it was announced that Chiles would be axed from the show. So far, it has been confirmed that former sports editor on the show Dan Lobb, will be taking his place.  In January 2011, Chiles began presenting ""That Sunday Night Show"" on ITV1, which returned for a second series in September 2011. Charity work.

wikipedia-2343808," WFIE  WFIE is the NBC-afifliated television station for the Tri-State area of Southwestern Indiana, Northwestern Kentucky and Southeastern Illinois that's licensed to Evansville, Indiana. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 46 (mapping to virtual channel 14 via PSIP) from a transmitter in the Wolf Hills section of Henderson, Kentucky. Owned by Raycom Media, the station has studios on Mount Auburn Road in Evansville. Syndicated programming on WFIE includes: ""Jeopardy!"", ""Wheel of Fortune"", ""Dr. Phil"", ""The Dr. Oz Show"", and ""America Now"". History. WFIE was granted a construction permit on June 10, 1953, and began broadcasting on November 15, 1953 on analog UHF channel 62. The station, Indiana's sixth, was originally co-owned by Jesse, Isadore, and Oscar Fine. WFIE was the first station to be based in ""Evansville"", while WEHT's studios, then as now, were located across the Ohio River in Henderson, Kentucky, though it is licensed to Evansville. WFIE was originally a primary NBC outlet with secondary ABC (shared with WEHT) and DuMont affiliations. Both of those networks were dropped in August 1956 with the launch of WTVW (which took ABC) and the shutdown of DuMont. This left WFIE as a full-time NBC affiliate. It is the only station in the market to have never changed its primary affiliation; as such, WFIE, along with WISE-TV (which signed on six days after WFIE) in Fort Wayne, are the longest-tenured NBC affiliates in the state of Indiana. Also in 1956, WFIE became the area's first station to telecast color programming (by virtue of its NBC affiliation).  The Fine family sold the station to the George Norton family of Louisville, Kentucky (owners of fellow NBC affiliate WAVE-TV) in 1956. The Nortons' broadcasting holdings would eventually become known as Orion Broadcasting. With FCC approval, it moved to channel 14 in August 1961. It was the first station in Evansville to telecast live and local color programs beginning on March 10, 1966.  In October 1981, Orion merged with Cosmos Broadcasting Corporation, a subsidiary of insurance and broadcasting conglomerate Liberty Corporation. WFIE became the first television station in the market to broadcast in stereo in September 1985. Liberty bowed out of the insurance business in 2000 bringing WFIE directly under the company banner. In May 2002, the station began broadcasting digitally on channel 46.  On February 1, 2006, the Liberty Corporation merged with Raycom Media. In November 2006, WFIE added The Tube (a 24-hour music video channel similar to the early years of MTV) on digital channel 14.3 in accordance with many Raycom Media stations. In Summer 2007, The Tube shut down from the lack of advertiser support and this station ceased programming on 14.3 for the time. WFIE, along with many Raycom Media stations, added This TV to 14.3 on February 4, 2009. News operation. The station currently carries 32 hours of local newscasts per week (with six hours on weekdays, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces a half-hour weeknight-only newscast for its second digital subchannel, bringing the total amount to 34½ hours per week. As a result of the merger of the news operations of WTVW and WEHT on December 1, 2011, WFIE is now the only independent local television news operation in the Evansville market (CBS affiliate WEVV-TV has not carried local newscasts since it shut down its news department in 2001). In August 1977, the station became first in Evansville to remotely broadcast local news, sports, and weather outside its studios. It was the second station in Indiana (first in Evansville) to build its own Doppler weather radar system (located adjacent to the studios) in February 1988. In Fall 2005, it launched a 24-hour local weather channel on digital channel 14.2. Known as ""First Alert Weather Now"", it was part of NBC Weather Plus and featured continuous weather and news information, with local and national forecasts, as well as metro Evansville and regional traffic updates. With the shutdown of the national service in 2008, WFIE-DT2 remained as a local weather channel.  On April 3, 2006, WFIE abandoned 615 Music's popular ""News One"" theme music in favor of ""NBC Flagship"" as part of ""The NBC Collection"" by Gari Communications. This marked the station's first theme change since 1996. In early-August 2006, it began branding its newscasts as ""14 News"" dropping the ""NewsWatch 14"" identity. In a further transition, the station rebranded the weather department under the ""First Alert"" label on September 22, 2006. This is a departure from the ""Storm Team"" brand used since the mid-1990s.  On April 16, 2007, WFIE introduced ""Dual Doppler"" to the market with the debut of a second weather radar in Owensboro, Kentucky atop the Owensboro Medical Health System Hospital main building on East Parrish Avenue (KY 54). In addition to its main studios, the station operates Western Kentucky Newsrooms in Owensboro and Madisonville. It is the only channel in the area to have a weekday morning show that begins at 4:30. WFIE-DT2 also airs a prime time newscast weeknights at 9 p.m., which competes with an hour-long show on independent station WTVW. On July 11, 2011, WFIE began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition during the station's 5 p.m. newscast, becoming the first station in the Evansville market to begin offering local newscasts in high definition. On September 12, 2011, WFIE debuted a 4 p.m. newscast that competes against the 4 p.m. newscast on ABC affiliate WEHT; Jackie Monroe (currently the anchor of the station's 10 p.m. newscast and the 9 p.m. newscast seen on digital channel 14.2) serves as anchor of the new late-afternoon newscast.

wikipedia-2343811," Temperature measurement  Attempts of standardized temperature measurement have been reported as early as 170 AD by Claudius Galenus. The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 17th century. Early devices to measure temperature were called thermoscopes. The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani, Ferdinand II. The development of today's thermometers and temperature scales began in the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer using mercury and a scale both developed by Ole Christensen Rømer. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale. Technologies. Many methods have been developed for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer. Other important devices for measuring temperature include: One must be careful when measuring temperature to ensure that the measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature. The theoretical basis for thermometers is the zeroth law of thermodynamics which postulates that if you have three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B are at the same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature then A and C are at the same temperature. B, of course, is the thermometer. The practical basis of thermometry is the existence of triple point cells. Triple points are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature such that three phases are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid. For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and any change in the three variables results in one or more of the phases vanishing from the cell. Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure. (See Gibb's phase rule)  Under some conditions it becomes possible to measure temperature by a direct use of the Planck's law of black body radiation. For example, the cosmic microwave background temperature has been measured from the spectrum of photons observed by satellite observations such as the WMAP. In the study of the quark-gluon plasma through heavy-ion collisions, single particle spectra sometimes serve as a thermometer. Surface air temperature. Meteorological observatories measure the temperature and humidity of the air near the surface of the Earth usually using thermometers placed in a Stevenson screen, a standardized well-ventilated white-painted instrument shelter. The thermometers should be positioned 1.25–2 m above the ground. Important note. Details of this setup are defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The true daily mean, obtained from a thermograph, is approximated by the mean of 24 hourly readings (which is not the same as the mean of the daily minimum and maximum readings). The world's average surface air temperature is about 15 °C. For information on temperature changes relevant to climate change or Earth's geologic past see: Temperature record. References.

wikipedia-2343833," Caroline Bonaparte  Maria Annunziata Carolina (Marie Annonciade Caroline) Murat (née Bonaparte) (25 March 1782 – 18 May 1839), better known as Caroline Bonaparte, was the seventh surviving child and third surviving daughter of Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino, and a younger sister of Napoleon I of France. Her complete title was """"Princesse française"", Grand Duchess Consort of Berg and Cleves, Queen Consort of Naples and Sicily, Princess Consort Murat, ""Comtesse de Lipona"""". Early years. Caroline was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was a younger sister of Joseph Bonaparte, Napoléon Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte and Pauline Bonaparte. She was an older sister of Jérôme Bonaparte. In 1793, Caroline moved with her family to France during the French Revolution. There, she fell in love with Joachim Murat, one of her brother's generals, and they married on 20 January 1800. Caroline was seventeen years old. Initially, Napoleon did not wish to allow them to marry, however, his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais persuaded him to change his mind. Caroline had been a pupil at the school in St-Germain-en-Laye founded by Madame Jeanne Campan. She attended the school at the same time as Hortense, Joséphine's daughter and Caroline's brother Louis' wife. Queen of Naples. Ambitious, extravagant, and power-hungry, she became Grand Duchess of Berg and Cleves on 15 March 1806 and Queen consort of Naples on 1 August 1808. She was intensely jealous of her sister-in-law Joséphine and her children, as she felt Napoleon favored them over his Bonaparte relatives. Caroline continuously plotted against Joséphine. It was Caroline who arranged for Napoleon to take a mistress, Éléonore Denuelle, who duly gave birth to his first illegitimate child. This had the desired effect of establishing that Joséphine was infertile as Napoleon showed he was clearly capable of siring children. When Napoleon married his second Empress Consort Marie Louise of Austria, Caroline was responsible for escorting her to France. After meeting her at the border of Austria and her duchy, Caroline forced Marie-Louise to leave all her luggage, servants, and even her pet dog, behind in Austria. Consequently, she devoted herself to the interests of her husband Joachim Murat, the King of Naples. Her relations with Napoleon became increasingly strained in 1813–1814, as Joachim shifted allegiances. She supported his decision to make a separate peace with the anti-Napoleonic allies, keeping his throne while Napoleon was deposed. Then, during the Hundred Days of 1815, Joachim came out for Napoleon. He was defeated and executed, and Caroline fled to the Austrian Empire. In 1830, she married Francesco Macdonald (1777–1837), who had been Minister of War of the Kingdom of Naples in 1814 and 1815. She lived in Florence until her death in 1839. The couple had no children. One of her direct descendants is the American actor René Auberjonois. Specifically, he is her great-great-great-grandson. Issue.

wikipedia-2343844," Smoke Two Joints  ""Smoke Two Joints"" is a song originally written by The Toyes, who performed it in traditional Reggae style and released it in 1983. According to The Toyes, ""one fine fall day on a small island"" of Oahu in Hawaii, two of the band members, Jim and Sandy, were sitting under a large banyan tree on Kuhio Beach, ""tokin' on some sweet bud & jammin' on a rootsy reggae funky town"" when they conceived the song ""Smoke Two Joints."" For decades, the San Francisco radio station KFOG has played the song at 4:20 pm every Friday. The song debuted on the ""Dr. Demento"" syndicated radio program and quickly disappeared. The song was then rediscovered and first popularized on a commercial FM station by morning DJ Sea Bass at WXTB in Tampa, who began playing the song regularly as the opening music to his show. It was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 American comedy-thriller film ""Homegrown"". The Toyes version was featured in the 2005 video game ""NARC"". The song is often mistakenly attributed to Bob Marley on the internet and file sharing websites. Marley had been dead two years when this song was written. Nardini cover version. Norman Nardini, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created two or more cover versions of this song in the 1980s. One was a studio LP, and another was a version featured on his live CD from 1994, both produced by Circumstantial Records, based in New York City. Norman first came across the song in 1983 when his friend Stush brought home the 45 as part of the music he had bought during a vacation in Hawaii. Nardini had his band learn it at once and has been performing the song for over twenty years. He wanted to air a cover version on CBS in the 1980s, but the label could not track down the original writers. Sublime cover version. The punk/ska band ""Sublime"" performed a cover version on their 1992 debut album ""40oz. to Freedom"". ""Smoke Two Joints"" was one of the first Sublime songs to be played on the radio after ""Date Rape"". This cover includes samples taken from the film ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" (though this intro is typically removed when the song is played on the radio), of a bong being used, and of the artists Eazy E and Just Ice. Bert Susanka, the lead singer of The Ziggens (a major influence on Sublime), is also sampled saying, ""Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died!"" The track is also featured on the 2003 film ""Grind"" and is on the ""Grind"" motion picture soundtrack as a somewhat shorter version. The track is also used in the film ""Mallrats"" when the contestants for a game show are passed out on the floor. ""Smoke Two Joints"" was released in 1994. "
wikipedia-2343863," Jim Pepper  Jim Pepper (born James G. Pepper; June 18, 1941 in Salem, Oregon – February 10, 1992 in Portland, Oregon) was an American jazz saxophonist, composer, and singer of Native American ancestry. Biography. Beginning in the late 1960s, Pepper became a pioneer of fusion jazz. His band, The Free Spirits, (active between 1965 and 1968, with guitarist Larry Coryell) is credited as the first to combine elements of jazz and rock. His primary instrument was the tenor saxophone (he also played flute and soprano saxophone). A similar timbre was taken up by later players such as Jan Garbarek, Michael Brecker, and David Sanborn. Of Kaw and Creek heritage, Pepper also achieved notoriety for his compositions combining elements of jazz and Native American music. Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman encouraged Pepper to reflect his roots and heritage and incorporate it into his jazz playing and composition. His ""Witchi Tai To"" (derived from a peyote song of the Native American Church which he had learned from his grandfather) is the most famous example of this hybrid style; the song has been covered by many other artists including Harper's Bizarre, Ralph Towner (with and without Oregon), Jan Garbarek, Pete Wyoming Bender, Brewer & Shipley, and an unreleased version recorded by The Supremes in 1969. Pepper supported the American Indian Movement. He served as musical director for ""Night of the First Americans"", a Native American self-awareness benefit concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. in 1980 and played also at numerous pow-wows. Pepper was a member of the short-lived band ""Everything Is Everything"" with Chris Hills, Lee Reinoehl, Chip Baker, John Waller and Jim Zitro. Their sole album spawned the near-hit single ""Witchi Tai To"" (which received abundant airplay and on which Pepper was the lead singer).

wikipedia-2343956," Lomilomi massage  Lomilomi is the word used today to mean ""massage therapist"" or ""Hawaiian massage."" In the Hawaiian language, the word used traditionally, called lomi, means ""to rub, knead, press, squeeze, massage; to work in and out, as the claws of a contented cat."" Traditional practice. Lomilomi practitioners use the palms, forearms, fingers, knuckles, elbows, knees, feet, even sticks and stones. Lomilomi practices varied by family, Ahupuaʻa (traditional region) and island.  Traditionally in ancient Hawaii lomilomi was practiced in four contexts:  Although the term ""kahuna lomilomi"" is widely used in contemporary writings, traditionally the people who performed lomilomi were called ""ka poe lomilomi"" (the massage people) or ""kanaka lomi"" (massage person). A related term, ""kauka lomilomi"", was coined in 1920 to describe osteopathic physicians. The word ""kauka"" is the Hawaiianized version of ""doctor"". Like all endeavors in old Hawaii, lomilomi was conducted with prayer and intention.  Hawaiian kupuna (elder) Auntie Margaret Machado describes lomilomi as ""praying"" work. Emma Akana Olmstead, a kupuna of Hana, Maui, in the 1930s, said, ""When a treatment is to be given, the one who gives the treatment first plucks the herbs to be used. He prays as he picks the herbs. No one should call him back or distract his attention, all should be as still as possible for they do not want the vibration broken. They knew the laws of vibration. They knew the power of the spoken word. They knew Nature. They gathered the vibration of the plentiful."" History of lomilomi. The early Polynesian settlers brought their own form of massage and, like a canoe plant, it evolved to become something uniquely Hawaiian. It was practiced by everyone, from child to chief. As an indigenous practice that evolved over hundreds of years in isolated valleys throughout the island chain, there are many different ""schools"" of lomilomi with different approaches and techniques. After American missionaries arrived in 1820 and converted many in the Kingdom of Hawaii to Christianity, various laws prohibited ""heathen"" worship and any related Native Hawaiian healing practices. Lomilomi as part of medical practice went underground. But lomilomi as restorative massage remained popular not only among the Hawaiians, but among foreign residents and visitors as well. Charles Wilkes describes it being offered after his ascent of Mokuaweoweo in 1841 on the United States Exploring Expedition. For Robert Louis Stevenson it was ""disagreeable"", but English adventurer Isabella Bird found it delightful. Not only did foreigners receive lomilomi, they also gave it. According to William Brigham the first Director of the Bishop Museum, writing in 1908, one of the most skilled practitioners was Sanford Dole, one of the leaders of the overthrow of the Kingdom.  Although the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii banned curing through ""superstitious methods"" in 1886, massage was not subject to legislation until 1945. In 1947, the Board of Massage was established to regulate lomilomi and massage. The law required practitioners to pass a written test on anatomy, physiology and massage theory. Many renowned native healers were unable or unwilling to pass the test, and thus lomilomi as restorative massage was forced underground. In 2001, the Legislature passed Act 304, amending HRS section 453, allowing native practitioners to be certified by the Hawaiian medical board, Papa Ola Lōkahi, or by the various community health centers. This law is controversial among some native practitioners, but those who are certified (but not licensed) can provide lomilomi without fear of prosecution under Hawaii state law. Traditional Lomilomi today. Lomilomi is now a common and popular massage modality throughout the world, especially in Hawaii, Japan and Europe.  Many traditionally taught lomilomi practitioners find it virtually impossible to offer authentic lomilomi in a spa setting and are unwilling to work in most spas or massage offices. They prefer to treat selected clients quietly and privately, often in home settings. Lomilomi practitioners may also ask their clients to pray, meditate, change their diets, and engage in other self-help activities usually believed to lie outside the scope of massage in an effort to truly help the clients obtain optimal health. Unlike traditional lomilomi kupuna (elder) recognized by the Hawaiian community who require students to study with them for years, some massage schools around the world purport to train therapists in lomilomi in a few hours. Some massage therapists may practice what they call lomilomi and incorporate techniques from other massage modalities during the session. While often pleasant, this style of massage is very different from authentic lomilomi. "
wikipedia-2343976," Robinson list  A Robinson list or Mail Preference Service (MPS) list is an opt-out list of people who do not wish to receive marketing transmissions. The marketing can be via e-mail, postal mail, telephone, or fax. In each case, contact details will be placed on a blacklist. Although the purpose of such a list is to reduce unwanted marketing, the principle that ""data is only private until someone decides it isn't"" indicates it can also generate unwanted marketing. In the UK, the Mailing Preference Service composes a Robinson list funded by the direct mail industry which collects names and addresses of people who do not want to receive direct marketing. This list is circulated to marketing companies which are then responsible for not contacting people on the list. Although use of this list is governed by the Advertising Standards Authority and the Code of Practice of the Direct Marketing Association, there is nonetheless the potential for names on the list to be used for the opposite of their intended purpose, either accidentally or intentionally.

wikipedia-2344011," Ron Diaz  Ron Diaz (born c. 1955) is an American radio talk show host on Clear Channel Radio's sports radio station WDAE (620 AM and 95.3 FM) in Tampa, Florida as the host of the highly rated The Ron & Ian Show. The Ron & Ron Show. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Ron Diaz partnered with stand-up comedian Ron Bennington to create the wildly successful raucous morning radio program, ""The Ron and Ron Show"" on Tampa Bay, Florida radio station WYNF-FM (95YNF). The show also featured regulars Fez Whatley, Fast Eddie, Billy the Phone Freak and Flipper. The show's audience quickly grew and was a huge ratings success and ripe for syndication. Known as ""Radio's Bad Boy's"" Diaz and Bennington teamed with their agent Ross Reback to found The Ron & Ron Radio Network to syndicate their show nationally. ""The Ron & Ron Shows""' final broadcast for WYNF-FM was on March 12, 1993, as Reback quickly negotiated a deal for the newly formed network to broadcast the show in Miami, FL, Orlando, FL, and Jacksonville, FL with another dozen markets soon following (including a new more lucrative deal in Tampa, FL).  ""The Ron & Ron Show"" regularly featured celebrity guests and Ron & Ron made national headlines after engaging in a screaming match with apparently inebriated actor Don Johnson (""Miami Vice, Nash Bridges"") which was highly chronicled in the press, on many TV entertainment news shows and was featured in People Magazine and on Inside Edition. The show made international headlines once again when show regular Flipper formed a rock band to play at the upcoming Ron & Ron Live Gig in Miami, FL and named his band ""The Dead German Tourists"" after two German tourists who had recently been murdered upon leaving the Miami International Airport in a rental car. The band's name caused an uproar and Miami city officials held an emergency meeting and voted to prohibit ""The Ron & Ron Show"" from holding their Live Gig within Miami city limits. The show considered the city council's vote a form of censorship, and undeterred, moved the Live Gig to neighboring Hallandale, FL at the last minute. An estimated crowd of approximately 10,000 fans attended the show. In May 1993, Diaz's wife Debbie was diagnosed with AIDS, leading him to periodically take time off from the show. On December 20, 1994, Ron Bennington publicly broke the news of Debbie's diagnosis and devoted their entire show that day to the topic of AIDS. On November 13, 1995, Debbie Diaz died.  Ross Reback successfully negotiated a divestiture of The Ron & Ron Radio Network through a sale to Paxson Communications Corp., then a publicly traded company headed by Lowell W. Bud Paxson, the co-founder and former president of Home Shopping Network (HSN). At the time, Paxson Communications owned a large number of radio station properties, in addition to being the largest owner of television stations in the country. Ron Diaz announced his departure on-air from ""The Ron & Ron Show"" in early 1997 as Paxson prepared to relocate it from the network's studios in St. Petersburg, FL to one in Hollywood, FL. Without Diaz and under Paxson the show quickly floundered. On September 29, 1997 after a successful 11 year run (the last few months of which featured several replacement hosts, all of whom took the name ""Ron"" in a failed attempted replacement of Diaz) ""The Ron & Ron Show"" was promptly canceled when Paxson's radio division was acquired by Clear Channel Radio. Ron & Ron Live Gigs. ""The Ron & Ron Show"" was also famous for hosting a series of live events known as Ron & Ron Live Gigs which were live broadcasts of their radio program in a rock concert type atmosphere and would feature musical acts, celebrities, stunts, etc. These live appearances would typically attract estimated crowds of between 10,000 and 30,000 attendees. Let The Puppies Breathe. The Ron & Ron Radio Network produced two full length feature videos - Ron & Ron - Let The Puppies Breathe, and ""Ron & Ron's Pup Friction"" which contained video highlights from the radio show along with specially produced material. Both videos were huge sellers to their loyal listener base. The term ""let the puppies breathe"" is a reference the show used to encourage women to expose their breasts. Thunder 103.5. Ron Diaz announced his departure from ""The Ron & Ron Show"" on-air in 1997. A short time later, Diaz joined Clear Channel Radio's Classic Rock station WTBT-FM (Thunder 103.5) as its morning host, as the station launched it's dial position on 103.5. The Ron & Ian Show. Ron Diaz now hosts ""The Ron & Ian Show"" with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Ian Beckles on WDAE (620 AM and 95.3 FM) in Tampa, FL.  "
wikipedia-2344012," Immigrant Song  ""Immigrant Song"" is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released as a single from their third studio album, ""Led Zeppelin III"", in 1970. Overview. The song begins with a distinctive, wailing cry from vocalist Robert Plant and is built around a repeating, staccato Jimmy Page/John Paul Jones/John Bonham riff in the key of F# minor. There is a very faint count-off at the beginning of the track with lots of hiss which appears on the album version, but is trimmed from the single version. The hiss is feedback from an echo unit. ""Immigrant Song"" was written during Led Zeppelin's tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany in mid-1970. The opening date of this tour took place in Reykjavík, Iceland, which inspired Plant to write the song. As he explained: Just six days after Led Zeppelin's appearance in Reykjavik, the band performed the song for the first time on stage during the Bath Festival. The song's lyrics are written from the perspective of Vikings rowing west from Scandinavia in search of new lands. The lyrics make explicit reference to Viking conquests and the Old Norse religion (""Fight the horde, sing and cry, Valhalla, I am coming!""). In a 1970 radio interview, Plant jokingly recalled: ""Immigrant Song"" is one of Led Zeppelin's few single releases, having been released in November 1970 by their record label, Atlantic Records. It reached #16 on the Billboard charts. Its B side, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"", was otherwise unavailable before the release of the band's first boxed set in 1990. The single was also mistakenly released in Japan with ""Out on the Tiles"" as the B-side rather than ""Hey Hey What Can I Do."" That single is now a rare collectible. First pressings of the US single of the song have a quote from Aleister Crowley inscribed in dead wax by the run-out groove: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."" One of the lines from the song became part of Led Zeppelin lore. The line, """"The hammer of the gods/will drive our ships to new lands"""" prompted some people to start referring to Led Zeppelin's sound as the ""Hammer of the Gods."" The phrase was used as the title of Stephen Davis' biography of the band, ""Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga"". The lyrics also did much to inspire the classic heavy metal myth, of mighty Viking-esque figures on an adventure, themes which have been adopted in the look and music of bands from Iron Maiden to Manowar. ""Immigrant Song"" was used to open Led Zeppelin concerts from 1970 to 1972. On the second half of their 1972 concert tour of the United States, it was introduced by a short piece of music known as ""LA Drone"", designed to heighten the sense of anticipation and expectation amongst the concert audience. By 1973, ""Immigrant Song"" was occasionally being used as an encore, but was then removed from their live set. Live versions of the song can be heard on the Led Zeppelin albums ""How the West Was Won"" (featuring a performance at Long Beach Arena in 1972) and the ""Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions"" (a version from the Paris Theatre in London in 1971). When played live, Page played a lengthy guitar solo, which was absent on the recorded ""Led Zeppelin III"" version. ""Immigrant Song"" was played as part of the 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Jeff Beck by both Page and Beck. Personnel. In the song, Page probably played his Gibson Les Paul 1959 with a sunburst finish which he began to use in 1969 (prior he played his 1964 Fender Telecaster given as a present by Jeff Beck) with Marshall or Vox Amplification. John Paul Jones played his Fender Precision Bass. Cultural influence. Director John Carpenter cited the song as an influence when he was composing the main musical theme for his film ""Assault On Precinct 13"" (1976). Vanilla Ice used ""Immigrant Song"" as the basis for ""Power"", a rap metal song performed in concerts in 1999. Karen O from The Yeah Yeah Yeahs collaborated with Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and fellow musician Atticus Ross on a cover version for the soundtrack to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". The song is used in the movie ""School of Rock""; Jack Black asked the band for permission for the rights, as is shown in the DVD extras. In Shrek the Third, Snow White (voiced by Amy Poehler) sings the song to send her animal friends to attack the living tree guards. It's also used the in the Indian crime show ""Gumrah,"" broadcast on Channel V.≈ Formats and tracklistings. 1970 7"" single (US/Australia/New Zealand: Atlantic 45-2777, Austria/Germany: Atlantic ATL 70460, Belgium: Atlantic BE 650222, Canada: Atlantic AT 2777, France: Atlantic 650 226L, Holland: Atlantic ATL 2091043, Italy/Jamaica: Atlantic ATL 45-2777, Greece: Atlantic 2091 043, Japan: Warner Pioneer P-1007A, Portugal: Atlantic ATL N 28101, South Africa: Atlantic ATS 531, Spain: Atlantic H 671, Sweden: Atlantic ATL 70.460, Turkey: Atlantic 71505) 1970 7"" radio edit (US: Atlantic 45-2777 PL) 1970 7"" single (Colombia: WEA 167/168, Costa Rica: Atlantic 70.029, Mexico: Atlantic 1701-1919, Philippines: Atlantic 45-3741) 1970 7"" single (Japan: Nihon Gramophone DT-1180) 1970 7"" single (South Africa: Atlantic ATS 528) 1970 7"" single (Uruguay: Atlantic 2164013) 1970 7"" single (Venezuela: Atlantic 5-018) 1970 7"" EP (Mexico: Atlantic 2207-014) 1970 7"" EP (Bolivia: Polydor 608030) 1971 7"" single (Argentina/Chile/Peru: Atlantic 2091 149) 1992 CD single (US: Atlantic 2777-2) Chart positions.

The frame is usually made of wood, metal or plastic. There are many types of drying racks, including large, stationary outdoor racks, smaller, folding portable racks, and wall-mounted drying racks.

wikipedia-2344035," University of Michigan Library  The University of Michigan Library is the university library system of the University of Michigan, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the United States. The University of Michigan Library ranks in the top ten largest libraries in the United States. As of 2011-12, the University Library contained more than 12.25 million volumes, while all campus library systems combined held more than 13.36 million volumes. The Library also held 136,810 current serials, and over 4.42 million annual visits.  Founded in 1838, the University Library is the university's main library and is housed in 12 buildings, with more than 20 libraries, among the most significant of which are the Shapiro Undergraduate Library, Hatcher Graduate Library, Special Collections Library, and Taubman Health Sciences Library. However, several U-M libraries are independent of the University Library: the Bentley Historical Library, the William L. Clements Library, the Gerald R. Ford Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library of the Ross School of Business, and the Law Library of the University of Michigan Law School. The University Library is also separate from the libraries of the University of Michigan–Dearborn (Mardigian Library) and the University of Michigan–Flint (Frances Willson Thompson Library and Genesee Historical Collections Center). UM was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics. In December 2004, the University of Michigan announced a book digitization program in collaboration with Google (known as Michigan Digitization Project), which is both revolutionary and controversial. Books scanned by Google are included in HathiTrust, a digital library created by a partnership of major research institutions. Responding to restricted public funding and the rising costs of print materials, the Library has launched significant new ventures that use digital technology to provide cost-effective and permanent alternatives to traditional print publication. This includes access to print on demand books via the Library's Espresso Book Machine. The University Library is also an educational organization in its own right, offering a full range of courses, resources, support, and training for students, faculty, and researchers. History. The Michigan Legislature creates the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1838, and that year allocated funding for a library. The next year (three years before classes began), the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan acquired the University Library's first volume, John James Audubon's ""Birds of America"", purchased at a cost of $970. (The book is now displayed in the Library Gallery's Audubon Room). Also in 1838, the university's first professor, Asa Gray (known as the ""father of American botany""), was entrusted with a $5,000 budget to establish the first collection of books for the University Library; he purchased 3,400 volumes. Before the university's first years, books were stored in various places around campus, including at the Law School and in various professors' homes. In 1956, the North Wing of the University Building was remodeled, and books centralized in the University's Library and Museum there. In 1863, the Library moved to the Law Building. In 1883, the university's first library building was completed, although within twelve years of its construction the building was already too small for the growing collection. Between 1870 and 1940 the collection grew rapidly, from 17,000 to 941,500. In 1890, the University Library inaugurated a handwritten card catalog system, which later changed to typed cards and, after 1900, to printed cards from the Library of Congress. By 1895, the Library's overcrowding problem had become acute, and President James Burrill Angell told the Regents that ""The embarrassment, to which I have called attention in previous reports, arising from the crowded condition of the Library, of course grows more serious every year."" In 1900, the library established ""caged areas in the stacks to protect books of exceptional value,"" become one of the first rare book rooms to be established in America. By 1905, student borrowing privileges had become established, a shift from the early restricted-circulation model in which students needed a faculty member's permission to check books out of the Library. In 1911, the Detroit anarchist Joseph Labadie donated his personal library to the university, establishing the nucleus of the what became of the Labadie Collection, the oldest collection of radical-left history materials in the world. By 1915, the overcrowded, wood-constructed General Library was designated a fire hazard by the Board of Regents. After this, a new building was finally constructed. Designed by architect Albert Kahn, the library building (which is today the north building of the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library) was dedicated on January 7, 1920. The same year, Professor Francis W. Kelsey (who founded the university's Kelsey Museum of Archaeology) added 617 ancient Egyptian papyri to the university's holdings, beginning the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection, which became the largest in the Americas. By 1940, the University Library's card catalog has 2,000 trays and 1.75 million cards. A post-World War II boom in enrollment, fueled by the G.I. Bill, further strained the Library's crowding problems as the library continued to expand. In 1947, the Library took over collection development responsibilities, replacing the old system in which each academic department selected and purchases books and journals. In 1948, the Library established its Far Eastern Library (renamed the Asia Library in 1959) of materials from China, Japan, and Korea; the Asian Library is now the largest collection of East Asian resources in North America.  In 1970, an eight-story addition was built, where much of the print collections are housed, along with the Library's administration offices, the Map Library, Special Collections, and Papyrology. In 1959 the Shapiro Undergraduate Library was built, with a policy of open access to the stacks for students. In years to come the principle of access to materials would become the standard and goal for all libraries and initiatives. Collections. Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. The Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library is the university's the primary research collection for the humanities and social sciences. It contains over 3.5 million volumes and over 10,000 periodicals written in more than 300 languages. Commonly cited collecting strengths of the Graduate Library include English and French history, papyrology, Germanic history and culture, classical archeology, military history, English Literature, social and political movements. In addition, these general stacks collections are supported by strong holdings in United States and foreign government documents, a significant collection of maps and cartographic materials, a comprehensive collection of publications written in East Asian languages, manuscripts and special collections, over 1.5 million items in microformat, and a strong collection of reference and bibliographic sources. A number of units are physically located in the Hatcher Library or are organizationally associated with the Hatcher Library.

The Asia Library also has a reference room with essential reference materials, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, maps, bibliographies, and indexes, in both East Asian and Western languages. The Asia Library launched its own website in April 1994, making it one of the first multilingual websites on East Asian studies. Stephen S. Clark Library:  The Clark Library is the university's combined ""map collection, government information center, and spatial and numeric data services"" center. Its map collection is the largest in Michigan and one of the largest of any university, consisting of more than 370,000 maps and about 10,000 atlases and reference works. The map collection's holdings include a variety of cartographic materials, including maps, atlases, gazetteers, geographical dictionaries, and other reference works. Among the highlights of the collection are Abraham Ortelius's 1570 ""Americae sive novi Orbis, nova Descriptio"", an early map of the Americas; Giambattista Nolli's 1798 ""Nuova Pianta di Roma"", a map of Rome; Giovanni Battista Piranesi's 1746 ""Plan of the Course of the Tiber"", a plan of the Tiber River commissioned by Pope Benedict XIV; a 1809 pocket globe, and Guillaume Coutans's 1880 ""Tableau Topographique des Environs de Paris"". The Library is storing and preserving digitized version of their maps in a new digital collection. The collection currently contains over 100 maps. The Clark Library Government Information Collection serves as a center for government documents. The university is a Federal Depository Library for U.S. government documents, and is also the a depository for publications of the State of Michigan, government of Canada, United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and European Union. The University's collection of publications of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organization (WTO) are also held at the Clark Library. Highlights of the Government Information Collection include a full run of all U.S. congressional publications since 1789, all UN documents since 1946, and all U.S. Census documents since 1790. The library's Spatial and Numeric Data Services (SAND) is housed at the Clark Library and on North Campus at SAND North in the Spatial Analysis Lab (room 2207) of the Art and Architecture Building. SAND assists in research, and ""locates, acquires, and converts numeric and spatial data sets, especially social science data sets. SAND also supports the use of geographic information systems (GIS) software. Special Collections Library The Special Collections Library is ""home to some of the most historically significant treasures at the University of Michigan."" The collection is non-circulating, with many materials stored off-site and retrieved upon request. The Special Collections Library includes around 275,000 published volumes, as well as an estimated 6,500 linear feet of archival material, about 450 incunabula (pre-1501 books), and almost 1,400 early manuscripts on vellum and paper. The Special Collections Library also includes an estimated 20,000 posters and prints and 10,000 photographs. Notable strengths of the Special Collections Library include: Jewish Heritage Collection  The Library's special collection on Jewish history and culture, from a gift made jointly to the Frankel Center for Judaic Studies and the University Library.

The library has especially strong collections in early twentieth-century art and design, with many materials on the Bauhaus school, Le Corbusier, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Independent libraries. There are also several collections that are affiliated with the university, but are not part of the University Library system. Two historical libraries are the Bentley Historical Library and the William L. Clements Library. The former is home of the University of Michigan's archives as well as the Michigan Historical Collections, while the latter houses original resources for the study of American history and culture from the 15th to the early 20th century. The Clements Library is believed to be the first stand alone rare books collection at a public university. Other libraries include the Law School Library, the Ronald and Deborah Freedman Library of the Population Studies Center, and the Transportation Research Institute Library. The last library is one of the world's most extensive collections of literature on traffic safety. There is also a large number of independent departmental libraries, as well as small libraries in many student dormitories. Off-campus facilities. The only off-campus library in the University of Michigan system is the Biological Station Library. Its collection consists of over 16,000 cataloged volumes and more than 50 paper journals. It specializes in limnology, ornithology, ecology, systematics, taxonomy, and natural history. Located in Pellston, Michigan, near the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, the University of Michigan Biological Station is dedicated to education and research in field biology and environmental science. Not considered an independent library, but nevertheless a key facility for the entire U-M library system, the Buhr Remote Shelving Facility stores in a preservation-sensitive environment over two million items too fragile or rarely-used to be kept in the main libraries. Challenges and opportunities. MPublishing. MPublishing a library publishing initiative which is ""the hub of scholarly publishing at the University of Michigan."" Major activities of MPublishing include: ""publishing monographs in print and electronic forms; hosting and publishing journals, with an emphasis on online, open-access formats; developing new digital publishing models with the potential to become community portals for wider knowledge sharing; creating permanent, accessible versions of faculty publications and related materials; publishing and copyright consultation and education; rights advocacy for University of Michigan authors; reissuing materials from our collections and our faculty in new forms (reprints, electronic editions)."" MPublishing hosts and helps operated 25 University of Michigan-based journals and scholarly conference proceedings in a variety of fields. It also operates Deep Blue, the university's institutional repository. MPublishing operates several print-on-demand programs. The University of Michigan Faculty Reprints (FRS) returns out-of-print books written by university faculty back into circulation on an openly accessible and affordable basis, both online and in print. The library also has an Espresso Book Machine on the first floor of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library. The University of Michigan Press is a component of MPublishing. Digitization. Since the early 1990s, the University of Michigan Library has been a leader among research libraries in efforts to digitize its vast collections. The Digital Library Production Service (DLPS) of the U-M Library oversees the digitization of Library materials, and the development of online access systems for these digitized materials. In furtherance of this goal, DLPS developed its own digital library software, called Digital Library Extension Service (DLXS), that provides a uniform interface for its digitized items. DLPS oversees the scanning and optical character recognition of about 5,000 texts per year, many of them rare, brittle, or delicate. The Digital Library Production Service hosts many searchable digital collections. Among them are: DLPS is also affiliated with the Text Creation Partnership (TCP) to create searchable, full-text versions of works digitized in the Early English Books Online, Evans Early American Imprints, and the Eighteenth Century Collection Online projects. TCP, when its work is concluded, will have produced over 40,000 XML-encoded text files—making it one of the largest collections of its kind. Google and HathiTrust. In December 2004 the University Library and Google announced their plans to digitize the over 7 million print volumes held by the Library. Especially old and fragile items, or items in special collections, will not be handled by Google; these the Library will scan itself. It is estimated that it will take approximately six years for Google to complete the scanning process; without Google, the U-M Library was on pace to have their entire collection scanned in about 1000 years. All costs for the project are borne by Google, and the company has developed special scanning technology to ensure that the books are not damaged during the process. All books that are out of copyright will be available for the public to read online; those still in copyright will be searchable, but only brief excerpts will be available to read. Copyright holders, such as publishers and authors, who do not want their books to be scanned can request to have their works excluded from the project, though the Library and Google both maintain that authors and publishers benefit from having their works digitized, since it will make them easier to find and will potentially bring more sales. Though the project has been revolutionary, it is not without controversy. In September 2005 a lawsuit was filed against Google charging copyright infringement. The lawsuit is still pending, but the scanning goes on. On June 6, 2007, twelve universities cooperating as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) announced a new partnership with Google whose explicit goal was to offer a public, shared digital repository of all the open access content. That shared repository of library partners became HathiTrust. The University of Michigan, which developed the MBooks platform for its own digitized books, partnered with Indiana University and the CIC libraries and the University of California system to create governance and models for financial support. The partnership has grown to include more than 60 institutions. ARL rankings. Using a variety of metrics such as accessibility, materials expenditures, volumes held, and staff size, the Association for Research Libraries (ARL) has consistently ranked the UM library system among the top ten in the nation. Although Michigan ranks 8th among academic libraries as to total volumes held, it ranks 1st for unique titles held among all institutions reporting that statistic. "

Rask was drafted 21st overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs. On June 24, 2006 his rights were traded to the Bruins in exchange for goaltender Andrew Raycroft. Playing career. Finland. Rask started his career in the youth teams of his hometown club SaPKo in Savonlinna, Finland. He then played in 26 games for the Tampere-based Ilves Jr. in the Finnish Junior League. His goals against average (GAA) was 1.86 with two shutouts and a .935 save percentage. He was the top ranked European goaltender in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Rask played his last European ice hockey season as the number one goaltender for the Ilves senior team in the Finnish top-flight SM-liiga. Toronto Maple Leafs. The Toronto Maple Leafs drafted Rask in the first round (21st overall) of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Before playing a single regular season game for Toronto he was traded to the Boston Bruins for former Calder Trophy winning goaltender Andrew Raycroft. Toronto management had deemed Justin Pogge their potential goaltender of the future, and Rask became expendable. It was later revealed that the Bruins intended to release Raycroft, which would have made him available to Toronto without giving up Rask. Boston Bruins. On 5 May 2007, Rask signed a three-year contract with the Boston Bruins, and was in attendance to observe the Providence Bruins's 2006–07 playoff run for the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Calder Cup championship. The Providence team did not make it past the second round of the Calder Cup against the Manchester Monarchs, but Rask practiced with the Providence team briefly. On 5 November 2007, Rask was called up from Providence to the Boston Bruins for the first time. Just two weeks later, on 20 November, he recorded his first NHL win, a 4–2 victory on the road against his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. On 3 October 2008, the Bruins assigned Rask to the Providence Bruins. Rask had the best save percentage (.952) among the goalies in pre-season play, followed by teammates Manny Fernandez (.875) and Tim Thomas (.869), and Kevin Regan (.857), but the team decided to go with the two veteran goaltenders, Thomas and Fernandez, for the 2008–09 season. With nagging back spasms keeping Fernandez from play shortly after the All-Star Game break, Rask was once again called up to serve as a second goaltender, and on 31 January 2009 he played his first (and only) game with the Bruins in the 2008–09 season, and earned his first ever NHL shutout, a 1–0 home effort against the New York Rangers, with Marc Savard scoring the only Bruins goal. Not long after the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Rask, who had been named the backup goaltender to Thomas, signed a two-year extension to his contract with the Bruins on 5 November 2009 that kept him under contract through the 2011–12 season. In the 2009-10 regular season, Rask was the only goalie with a goals against average less than 2.00 and the only goalie with a save percentage over .930. Despite having been the only qualifying rookie in NHL history to lead the league with a sub-2.00 goals against average as well as lead the league in save percentage, and having supplanted the Vezina Trophy winner Thomas as the starter, Rask was not named as a finalist for the rookie of the year award. In the 2010-11 NHL season, Thomas returned to form, making Rask once again the backup. With the Bruins winning the Stanley Cup for Boston, Rask became only the second Finnish goaltender to do so, after Antti Niemi of the Chicago Blackhawks the previous year. On June 28, 2012 Rask re-signed with the Boston Bruins on a one-year, $3.5 million deal.  Prior to the declaration of the 2012-2013 season lockout, Rask was named as the starting goalie for the Bruins, replacing Tim Thomas, who would eventually be traded to the New York Islanders on February 7, 2013. He led the Bruins to their second Stanley Cup final in 3 years, but they lost in 6 games to the Chicago Blackhawks. On July 10, 2013, the Bruins re-signed Rask to an eight-year, $56 million contract.

wikipedia-2344068," A Forest  ""A Forest"" is a song by the English alternative rock band The Cure. Co-produced by Mike Hedges and The Cure's Robert Smith, it was released as a single from the band's second album ""Seventeen Seconds"" in April 1980. It was their debut entry on the United Kingdom chart, where it reached number 31. The accompanying music video was first shown on BBC's ""Top of the Pops"" programme on April 24, 1980. Recorded and mixed over seven days, along with the rest of the songs from the album, ""A Forest"" is representative of The Cure's early 1980s gothic rock phase. The song has featured on the band's setlists for many years. Several versions have appeared on concert albums, and it was remixed and released as a single from the ""Mixed Up"" album in 1990. The song has been covered by several artists including Blank & Jones, Sophie Barker and Ror-Shak. Background and recording. Mike Hedges co-produced the album ""Seventeen Seconds"" as well as ""A Forest"" with The Cure's Robert Smith. Hedges had first worked with the band on the track ""Killing an Arab"". Interviewed in 2004, he did not recall any demos existing for ""Seventeen Seconds""; the band generally played the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added. At the time of the recording of the album, bass guitarist Simon Gallup and keyboardist Matthieu Hartley had been added to the band's lineup. Gallup had replaced Michael Dempsey, who had departed to join The Associates. Gallup and Hartley joined remaining Cure members Smith (vocals) and Lol Tolhurst (drums) in late 1979 during the group's Future Pastimes tour, on which ""A Forest"" was one of the new songs added to their setlist. Due to budgetary restraints, ""Seventeen Seconds"" was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between £2000 and £3000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew ""A Forest"" would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. ""A Forest"" was one of the last tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals. Fiction Records owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound ""radio friendly"", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness. Work on mixing ""A Forest"" took up much of the final day of sessions for the album. Composition and lyrics. ""A Forest"" and its parent album ""Seventeen Seconds"" are representative of The Cure's gothic rock phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Cure biographer Jeff Apter refers to ""A Forest"" as ""the definitive early Cure mood piece"" and he argued the song is the centrepiece of the album. Smith's intention with ""A Forest"" was to make a song that was ""really atmospheric"". He has stated that it was a pivotal recording for the group, and represented ""the archetypal Cure sound"". ""A Forest"" is performed in the key of A minor. Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed by the introduction of the bass guitar and a second guitar part. The song initially follows an Am–C–F–Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains an B–C–F#m–C–B–C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word ""again"", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a pentatonic manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at at 4.46"". The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s. Mike Hedges favored the use of flanging at the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on ""A Forest"". Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in ""A Forest"" ""almost became a Smith trademark for a while"". Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of The Stranglers, whose bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel was a major influence on him. Smith has given varying explanations behind his lyrics for ""A Forest"". He has said that the lyrics were based upon a dream he had as a child where he was lost in the woods unable to escape, but later denied it and stated, ""It's just about a forest"". Release and promotion. ""A Forest"" was released as a single on 5 April 1980. Its b-side was ""Another Journey by Train"", an instrumental remake of The Cure's ""Jumping Someone Else's Train"". The single received a mixed critical reception, though commercially its sales were an improvement for the band. In early 1980, it spent eight weeks in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 31 on 12 April of that year. It was the highest they had placed on the chart by that point in their career. In the United States, the song reached number 47 on the ""Billboard"" Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. The Cure's former drummer Andy Anderson said ""A Forest"" was the first song he heard by the band. He was taken by both the music and vocals, and was espically drawn to Smith's guitar work and the keyboard melody, which he described as ""haunting."" He described the spare and simple 4/4 drum pattern as straightforward; ""all that is needed."" The promotional video for ""A Forest"" was the band's first. It was created by David Hiller, who mixed footage from the band's 24 April 1980 debut appearance on BBC's ""Top of the Pops"" programme with a forest montage. Smith said that the group ""came across looking very morose and disinterested"" in the video because that is how they felt at the time; he ""hated"" Top of the Pops as he was ""really anti-pop"" during this period. He recalled that he had been in pain at the time of the shoot as he had broken his thumb trying to change a tyre a few days previously. Re-recordings and cover versions. Since its release, ""A Forest"" has frequently appeared in the band's concert setlists. A live version of ""A Forest"" appeared on a four-song edition of ""The Hanging Garden"" released in July 1982. It was performed with what has been described as a ""rough, punk-edged"" sound on the 1984 live album """". A performance appears on the live video ""The Cure in Orange"", highly regarded by Allmusic reviewer Ned Raggett. Yet another live version of the song appears on disc one of the live album ""Bestival Live 2011"". In 1990, the track was re-recorded and remixed by Mark Saunders for The Cure's ""Mixed Up"" album. The ""Tree mix"" version of ""A Forest"" was released as a single on 6 December 1990, while the album had been released a few weeks before on 20 November. The song was redone for the second time on the """" box set, this time remixed by Mark Plati and featuring Earl Slick on guitar. This version was described as ""awful"" and ""instantly dated"" by reviewer Chris Ott. An acoustic version was recorded and released on the bonus disc that came with some copies of the 2001 ""Greatest Hits"" CD. Robert Smith supplied vocals for a Blank & Jones cover version of the song, which appeared on their 2004 album ""Monument"". Sophie Barker released a recording on her double A-side single ""A Forest / Say Goodbye"" which was released on 31 October 2011. Ror-Shak, a collaboration between DJ DB and Stakka, covered the song on their only album ""Deep"", which was released in 2005. The music video was used in the TV Series ""Fringe"" in 2008. English artist Bat for Lashes covered the song for the 2008 Cure tribute album ""Perfect as Cats: A Tribute to the Cure"". Luke Lewis of NME praised the version, noting it ""teases out a crepuscular, pagan atmosphere absent in the original"".\ Music Video. The music video shows the band playing in a dark place while showing pictures of trees. "

wikipedia-2344096," Marty Markowitz  Marty Markowitz (born February 14, 1945) is the Borough President of Brooklyn, New York City, the most populous borough in New York City with nearly 2.6 million residents. Markowitz was first elected borough president in 2001 after serving 23 years as a New York State Senator. His third term began in January, 2010. Personal life. Marty Markowitz born and raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a Jewish family. His father, Robert, was a waiter at Sid's, a kosher delicatessen. When Markowitz was nine years old his father died; his mother, Dorothy, later moved the family to public housing in Sheepshead Bay. Markowitz graduated from Wingate High School in 1962. He took night classes at Brooklyn College for nine years, and received his bachelor's degree in Political Science in 1970.  Markowitz and his wife Jamie Snow were married in 1999. Political career. Markowitz began his public service career in 1971, at the age of 26, by forming the Flatbush Tenants Council in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. The organization grew into Brooklyn Housing and Family Services, which is the largest tenants advocacy organization operating in New York State today . He was elected to the State Senate in 1978, and spent over two decades as a New York State Senator for Brooklyn. During his time as a state senator, he was known for creating a series of oceanfront concerts and other festivals rather than drafting legislation.  Markowitz first ran for Borough President in 1985, but failed to unseat the incumbent Howard Golden. Markowitz subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for failing to disclose a campaign contribution; he was fined and performed community service. Markowitz was elected to the borough presidency in 2001, as the Democratic candidate.  Markowitz was re-elected on November 8, 2005, with 79% of the vote, compared to 13% for Republican challenger Theodore Alatsas, and 7% for Gloria Mattera, the Green Party candidate. In the 2005 New York City mayoral election, Markowitz endorsed Republican incumbent Michael Bloomberg, as did many other Democrats including Ed Koch. Borough presidency. As borough presidents have little real power within city government, Markowitz has used the office to be an enthusiastic advocate for Brooklyn, promoting tourism and events borough-wide. During the Northeast Blackout of 2003, Markowitz stood on the Brooklyn Bridge as throngs of fellow Brooklynites trudged home from work in Manhattan, holding a megaphone and cheering ""Welcome home to Brooklyn!"" to thunderous applause. He repeated this during the 2005 New York City transit strike, inviting Brooklynites into Borough Hall for warm drinks and a chance to call loved ones. Markowitz frequently speaks at public schools in Brooklyn on occasions such as performances and graduations. Markowitz has called for the demolition of the residences at Admiral's Row, saying they are damaged beyond repair. However, the Beardsley / Crawford & Stearns report commissioned by the National Guard as part of the Section 106 review of the property disputes this claim. In 2006, Markowitz stated that ""a crucial community resource must take priority over preservation at Admirals Row"", presumably referring to the supermarket parking lot which will replace the historic Second Empire structures if the land is ceded to the city. During his four decades in public service, Markowitz has made the creation and preservation of affordable housing a top priority. Through capital funding and advocating for affordable units as part of the borough president’s ULURP (land use) authority, thousands of affordable housing units have been created, including inclusionary zoning in Greenpoint/Willamsburg and the Habitat for Humanity project in Ocean Hill/Brownsville. Markowitz also fought to save Starrett City, the nation’s largest federally-subsidized housing complex, and keep it “affordable forever.” Markowitz’s efforts to stimulate and grow Brooklyn’s economy include revitalizing Coney Island, re-zoning Greenpoint-Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn, cleaning up Newtown Creek, encouraging development of the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, attracting regional corporate headquarters, large manufacturers and retailers, startups and green businesses, and lobbying on behalf of Brooklynites for the affordable housing and jobs attached to the Atlantic Yards project.  As a longtime advocate for seniors, Markowitz fought vigorously to keep Brooklyn senior centers open when they were threatened with closures due to budget cuts. His efforts to save Brooklyn’s financially troubled medical institutions resulted in the preservation of maternity and pediatric units at Long Island College Hospital as well as the critical services provided by school medical clinics. Markowitz has also called for increased parental and community engagement in schools and has supported policies that improve graduation rates and prepare Brooklyn students to compete and succeed in the global economy. His office was instrumental in creating two new schools in Brooklyn: the High School for Innovation in Advertising and Media and the Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance.  Markowitz founded and currently hosts the Seaside Summer Concert Series (begun in 1979), New York City’s largest free weekly concert series, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Concert Series (started in 1983), the nation’s largest free public concerts for African American and Caribbean audiences. He has supported Brooklyn’s cultural community, including the BAM Cultural District and Issue Project Room, and is working to restore the Loew's Kings Theatre in Flatbush. Markowitz has hosted annual heritage events at Borough Hall celebrating Brooklyn’s diversity, including celebrations of the Turkish, Asian, Latino, African-American, Jewish, Caribbean, Italian, Greek, Russian, Polish, Lebanese and LGBT communities. Markowitz has worked to establish Brooklyn’s first-ever LGBT Center for Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Community Pride Center board has been formed to determine a location and gather support for the project. As borough president, Markowitz has founded initiatives to promote and improve the quality of life in Brooklyn, including Shop Brooklyn, the Lighten Up Brooklyn and Take Your Man to the Doctor campaigns, Camp Brooklyn, the jobs-for-youth Summer HEAT program, Dine in Brooklyn restaurant week, the Brooklyn Book Festival, the smART Brooklyn Gallery Hop and Brooklyn Tourism. Barclays Center. Markowitz was a supporter of the controversial Atlantic Yards complex. The arena, which would go on to be known as the Barclays Center, now houses the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and will become the home of the New York Islanders in 2015. His desire to bring an NBA team to Brooklyn had been known since his campaign for Borough President, and he was instrumental in persuading Bruce Ratner to purchase the Nets in 2004. In March 2008, Ratner acknowledged that much of the project was stalled - but that construction on the basketball arena would begin before 2009. This has angered many citizens, who have suggested that affordable housing should come before a sports complex for the developer's team. In 2002 Markowitz appointed Dolly Williams to the New York City Planning Commission. In 2004 it was revealed that Williams, who is co-founder of a Brooklyn construction company, had invested a million dollars in Bruce Ratner's purchase of the New Jersey Nets. Williams announce that she would recuse herself from any decisions about the Atlantic Yards project. Williams is the only Brooklyn appointee to the Planning Commission. On Thursday, April 3, 2008, Markowitz and his wife Jamie Snow attended a controversial gala honoring Ratner at the Brooklyn Museum. The gala featured Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and a performance by Kanye West. Markowitz delivered an address to gala attendees, prompting protesters outside to take a break from shouting ""shame"" in order to chant pejoratives at the Borough President. During this event, Markowitz's wife Jamie took eight limited edition fiberglass placemats designed by Murakami; this move caused some controversy, since there were only enough produced to provide each guest with one. Similar limited edition Murakami placemats have sold for around $1,000 on ebay. The arena opened on September 28th, 2012 with a concert by Brooklyn-born rapper Jay-Z Opposition to Prospect Park West bike lane. In September 2009, New York City Department of Transportation was scheduled to modify the layout of Prospect Park West, installing a two way protected bicycle lane. The project was stalled after Markowitz wrote a letter to the city opposing the measure. The traffic calming measures were planned in response to documented pedestrian safety issues and had the support of Community Board 6. A DOT study showed that ""more than 70% of vehicles were exceeding the 30 mph limit, and at least 15 percent were traveling at 40 mph or faster. From 2005 to 2007, there were 58 reported crashes on Prospect Park West."" The conflict came to a head in April 2010 when DOT announced plans to go ahead with the modifications. Markowitz made disparaging remarks about DOT commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, calling her a ""zealot"", though he later clarified his statement. Markowitz claimed he supports other bike lanes in the city, but his opposition stems from the elimination of parking spaces and one lane of traffic. The bike lane was completed in June 2010 despite Markowitz continued opposition. Markowitz lives in Windsor Terrace, on the southern portion of Prospect Park West. Possible Mayoral Bid. Markowitz was mentioned as a possible candidate for the 2009 Mayoral election. Bloomberg was asked what he thought about Markowitz, and according to WABC, he said it was too early to get involved choosing a candidate, but said, ""Markowitz seems very capable, and if he wants to run, he should run"" (though this statement was made before Bloomberg himself, after having term limitations for mayor of New York City removed by a vote of the city council, announced and won a third term). WABC reported he had gotten 18% in polls for the Democratic nomination. Conflicts of Interest Board violations and fine. In July 2011, New York City's Conflicts of Interest Board fined Markowitz $20,000, an unusually large penalty, for accepting three trips for his wife that were paid for by the governments of Turkey and the Netherlands. The Board found that ""by accepting travel expenses for his wife for each trip, used his position as a public servant for private or personal advantage."" The Board found that Markowitz was aware of the rule prohibiting his acceptance of the free trips at the time of the trips. "

It may be congenital, surgically created for hemodialysis treatments, or acquired due to pathologic process, such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm. Pathophysiology. When an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta, it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance. This lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues. The physical manifestations of this would be a relatively normal systolic blood pressure with a decreased diastolic blood pressure resulting in a wide pulse pressure. Normal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute (mL/min). After the creation of a fistula, the blood flow increases to 400—500 mL/min immediately, and 700—1,000 mL/min within 1 month. A bracheocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist. Both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress, but the vein dilates more and becomes ""arterialized"". In one study, the cephalic vein increased from 2.3 mm to 6.3 mm diameter after 2 months. When the vein is large enough to allow cannulation, the fistula is defined as ""mature.""  An arteriovenous fistula can increase preload. Complications. Just like berry aneurysm, an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage.  "
wikipedia-2344137," Armitage III  The series began with the four-part original video animation ""Armitage III"" and spawned two movies. The first film is a shortened version of the OVA entitled , redubbed in English and it is presented like a remake. The second movie, is a sequel set some years after the original story. The Region 1 DVD from Geneon of ""Dual Matrix"" was one of the few releases from the company to feature THX-certified audio and video. Plot. ""Armitage III: Poly-Matrix"". In 2046, the overpopulation of Earth has led to the colonization of Mars—with the aid of the ""first type"" androids, men were able to begin terraforming the unfriendly environment of Mars and build the city Saint Lowell. Seventy years after the start of colonization, the city is completed and inhabited by great numbers of people and ""Second type"" robots, much improved versions of the ""First types"". Ross Syllibus, a middle-aged policeman from Chicago, flies to Saint Lowell using a space shuttle. Syllibus asked to be transferred to the Martian Police Department to escape from his past and haunting memories of his previous partner being killed by a robot. At the Saint Lowell's space port he is to meet his new partner—a young woman named Naomi Armitage. On the same shuttle as Syllibus travels Kelly McCannon—""the last country singer in the Universe"". As the shuttle nears the terminal, a mysterious man is seen entering the cargo section; soon after this, the intruder is noticed and the alarms go off. Later, as Ross gets off the shuttle, he witnesses a disturbing scene at the airport. He bumps into the mysterious man with a big suitcase and two guards. Soon after that, Armitage orders the men to stop and get their hands up. Puzzled, Ross notices a few drops of blood spilling from the mysterious man's suitcase. The two robot guards are killed by Armitage and the mysterious man is wounded, but flees. However, he leaves his suitcase behind—inside of which is the dead body of Kelly McCannon. To everybody's surprise and horror, McCannon turns out to be a robot: a new, never-seen-before ""Third type"" android that is superficially identical to humans. Later, the mysterious man hacks into the public television system and replays the security camera footage. The tape shows the man killing Kelly McCannon and reveals the fact of her being a robot to the entire city. The mysterious man, René D'anclaude, reveals that the Third types have been among the regular people for a long time and nobody can tell them apart from humans. He also reveals a list of Thirds—and it turns out that a lot of well-known people are actually robots. Riots begin in the city as people start to capture and burn all the Thirds they can find. Meanwhile, René D'anclaude proceeds with his extermination of the Thirds. The two main characters start their investigation and eventually find out, that the victims are women. One of the dying victims sends out a message with the list of Thirds to save them from being slaughtered. Armitage receives it and pursues D'anclaude. Armitage is eventually revealed to be a third and goes into hiding as the police hunt for her. Ross seeks her out as she enlists the help of a male third named Julian Moore. D'anclaude then attacks them and is revealed to be a second. While the police drop the case with D'anclaude's supposed capture, Armitage and Julian search a databank for information on her origins. Armitage eventually defeats D'anclaude, but is too late to stop Julian from being killed. She and Ross break into the hospital D'anclaude was recovering in, branding themselves as criminals after the rescue. Armitage and Ross later go off in search of her ""father"", Dr. Asakura, only to learn he had lost his mind, as explained by a gentler, reprogrammed version of D'anclaude, living with delusions of creating ""Fourths"". His line of assassinroids were used by the government to kill Thirds so that there will be fewer birth rates on Mars, meaning the planet will have to ally with Earth, which they just did, to receive immigrants. During their time at Asakura's facility, Ross and Armitage fall in love. The next day, after Asakura deactivates Armitage so he can install angelical wings and particle cannons on her chassis, the military kills Asakura and Armitage and Ross eventually finish off the military. Months later, Ross returns to Mars, using false IDs, however Armitage throws hers away after Ross Sylibus' arrival. Ross learns that he is going to be a father. ""Armitage: Dual-Matrix"". Set some years after the original plot, this film follows Naomi Armitage as she investigates a military attack on robotics plant on Earth. It had been several years since the events of the previous OVA. Naomi Armitage and Ross Sylibus, now living under assumed identities, are living in St. Lowell on Mars, along with their daughter Yoko. Ross now works for a company seeking to restore oceans to Mars by using ice asteroids. However, a new effort to restore the Third project prompts Naomi to travel to Earth to figure out what is happening. Meanwhile, Ross saves a facility from a group of terrorists and is declared a Martian hero. When Armitage arrives on Earth, she confronts Colonel Strings, hero of the First Error, which was a suppression of a robot uprising, which in reality, was to cover up the existence of the Thirds. But then he is shot by agents of an Earth Robotronics Corporation. Its vice president, Demetrio Mardini, asks Armitage to give the data on how Thirds can conceive so humanity can create a race of beings who exist to serve. She refuses so he resorts to force and unleashes a robot that scrambles her eyes. She manages to use her telepresence abilities to hack into its system and overload it. She then escapes but is damaged and is found by a repairer third named Mouse, who prides himself on his skill and frequently brags that he's a ""genius"". However, Mouse is also an informant to Demetrio and presents the data he found on Armitage; but he only got the recent data and Demetrio wants the conception data. Mouse claims that he did not know about the conception data, and also that if it existed it would be with what he gave him; but Demetrio refuses to believe either of these and tries to brutally force it with two clones of Armitage, who severely injure Mouse. He does not get anything and throws Mouse in the trash. Mouse swears revenge. Back on Mars, prime minister Fredrick O'Hara sends Ross to Earth to represent the planet in the support of robot rights, promising amnesty from the charges against them. However, Demetrio's agents captured Yoko while Ross was away from the hotel, and is threatened that he will not see Yoko again if he votes for the Rights Bill. With a little reluctance, Ross remains neutral on the bill. Demetrio's agents, however, reveal that they were planning on killing Ross from the start, contrary to their deal. After a car chase, Armitage is able to save him at the very last moment. Together, they vow to rescue their daughter. They storm Demetrio's compound; Armitage deals with Demetrio while Ross saves Yoko. The same robot Armitage encountered earlier had been upgraded to withstand her telepresence attack. Meanwhile, Ross manages to locate Yoko in a freezer. Elsewhere, Demetrio demands the secret in exchange for forgetting the damages they committed against him and his company. Armitage lures him closer, presumably to tell him what he wants to know; but she ends up kicking him in the crotch and telling him that Third conception is not simply data, it is about true love. With that she escapes again, forcing Demetrio to unleash the clones on her. She manages to evade the two and meets up with Ross and Yoko. Yoko is overjoyed to see her mother but recoils when she sees Armitage's metal shoulder that was scraped off by the clones. Just then, they attack. While Armitage holds them off, Ross and Yoko make their way to an unused space elevator. It is here that Yoko shows that she has a photographic memory, leading them to the space elevator whose location she determined from a map she saw minutes beforehand (Ross comments that she is ""quite the little genius""). Soon, Armitage flees to Mouse, who repairs the damage and gives her a program that will allow her to go beyond her limited fighting abilities. He tells her that the password is ""Heaven's Door""; but that if she exceeds more than her internal battery can handle, she will ""be knocking at the Pearly Gates for real"". She also has him do her one more favor: broadcast the footage of the Third massacre attempts all over Earth and Mars (upon seeing it himself, Mouse comments, ""I think it's inhuman, and I'm a robot!""). This compels Demetrio to command the clones to prevent the family from leaving. After both clones are beaten, Demetrio tries having the elevator's defenses fired on their shuttle only to be killed by the last remaining clone, who is at the time controlled by what was left of Julian Moore in ""Poly-Matrix"". Without Demetrio's authorization, the turrets do nothing. A hologram of Julian Moore then appears, wishing the family goodbye. The movie ends with the family enjoying a day at the beach on Mars, on Naomi's birthday.  In a post-credits scene, Mouse salvages one of the Armitage clones for himself. It is then unknown what happens next in the Armitage series. "
wikipedia-2344165," Ellen Greene  Ellen Greene (born February 22, 1951) is an American singer and actress. Greene has had a long and varied career as a singer, particularly in cabaret, as an actor and singer in numerous stage productions, particularly musical theatre, as well as having performed in many films—notably ""Little Shop of Horrors""—and television programs. She starred as Vivian Charles on the ABC series ""Pushing Daisies"". Personal life. Greene was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her mother was a guidance counselor, and her father was a dentist. Greene is Jewish. She attended W. Tresper Clarke High School, in Westbury, New York. She spent summers at Cejwin Camps in Port Jervis, New York where she performed in musical theater productions, including the role of Tzeitel in a 1966 production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"". She was first married to Tibor Hardik. She also had a relationship with Martin P. Robinson. She married Christian Klikovits on September 25, 2003, and the two have since divorced. Career. Greene’s career began as a nightclub singer in clubs such as ""The Brothers and Sisters"", ""Grand Finale"" and ""Reno Sweeney"". She received rave reviews from critics such as Rex Reed, George Bell and John S. Wilson. Around this time she befriended the late Peter Allen. Her first starring role was as the lead in the notorious Broadway bomb, ""Rachael Lily Rosenbloom (And Don't You Ever Forget It)"" in 1973, which co-starred Anita Morris. She then won the starring role of Chrissy in Joseph Papp's production of ""In the Boom Boom Room"". Her reviews brought her to the attention of Paul Mazursky who was at that time casting for ""Next Stop, Greenwich Village""; she got the role of Sarah, her first starring role in a film. Continuing her work with Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, Greene next essayed the role of Jenny in ""The Three Penny Opera"" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center for which her performance was nominated for a Tony Award. In addition to a number of other productions with the New York Shakespeare Festival as well as numerous other companies, Greene formed a close working relationship with the WPA Theatre, where she met Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, which led to a close, long-lasting friendship. This led, in turn, among other productions, to the role for which she is perhaps most-widely known, that of the hapless Audrey in ""Little Shop of Horrors"", a role she reprised in the film version opposite Rick Moranis. Greene has worked extensively in theater, such as the part of Suzanne/The Little Rose in ""The Little Prince and the Aviator"", as well as in films such as ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can"", ""Léon"", ""Talk Radio"", and ""Pump Up the Volume"". She has appeared on television in ""Miami Vice"", ""Glory!

Her co-stars included Scott Bakula as Nathan Detroit, theatre veteran and Tony Award winner Brian Stokes Mitchell as Sky Masterson, and Jessica Biel as Sarah Brown. In 2011, she appeared in five episodes of the soap opera ""The Young and the Restless"" as Primrose DeVille. Greene performed in the musical ""Betwixt!"" at the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End from July 26 to August 20, 2011. She also recently appeared in two episodes of the new ABC Family show, ""Bunheads"", alongside Sutton Foster and Kelly Bishop. "
wikipedia-2344177," Santa Susana Field Laboratory  The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is a complex of industrial research and development facilities located on a portion of the Southern California Simi Hills in Simi Valley, California, used mainly for the testing and development of liquid-propellant rocket engines for the United States space program from 1949 to 2006, nuclear reactors from 1953 to 1980 and the operation of a U.S. government-sponsored liquid metals research center from 1966 to 1998. The site is located approximately northwest from the community of Canoga Park and approximately northwest of Downtown Los Angeles. Sage Ranch Park is adjacent on part of the northern boundary and the community of Bell Canyon along the entire southern boundary. Introduction. Three California state agencies and three federal agencies have been overseeing a detailed investigation of environmental impacts from historical site operations since at least 1990. Concerns about the environmental impact of past disposal practices have inspired at least two lawsuits seeking payment from Boeing and several interest groups are actively involved with steering the ongoing environmental investigation. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is the focus of diverse interests. The National Register of Historic Places listed Burro Flats Painted Cave is located within the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, on a portion of the site owned by the U.S. government. The drawings within the cave have been termed ""the best preserved Indian pictograph in Southern California."" Several tributary streams to the Los Angeles River have headwater watersheds on the SSFL property, including Bell Creek (90% of SSFL drainage), Dayton Creek, Woolsey Canyon, and Runkle Creek. Several unidentified flying object sightings have been associated with the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, one as recent as April 2007. History. SSFL was slated as a United States government facility dedicated to the development and testing of nuclear reactors, powerful rockets such as the Delta II, and the systems that powered the Apollo missions. The location of SSFL was chosen in 1947 for its remoteness in order to conduct work that was considered too dangerous and too noisy to be performed in more densely populated areas. In subsequent years however, the Southern California population grew, along with housing developments surrounding ""The Hill."" Today, more than 150,000 people live within of the facility, and at least half a million people live within .  The site is divided into four production and two buffer areas, (Area I, II, III, and IV, and the northern and southern buffer zones). Areas I through III were used for rocket testing, missile testing, and munitions development. Area IV was used primarily for nuclear reactor experimentation and development. Laser research for the Strategic Defense Initiative (popularly known as ""Star Wars""), was also conducted in Area IV. Rocket engine development. North American Aviation (NAA) began its development of liquid propellant rocket engines after the end of WWII. The Rocketdyne division of NAA, which came into being under its own name in the mid-1950s, designed and tested several rocket engines at the facility. They included engines for the Army's Redstone (an advanced short-range version of the German V-2), and the Army Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) as well as the Air Force's counterpart IRBM, the Thor. Also included were engines for the Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), as well as the twin combustion chamber alcohol/liquid oxygen booster engine for the NAVAHO, a large, intercontinental cruise missile that never became operational. Later, Rocketdyne designed and tested the huge F-1 engine that was eventually used as one of a cluster of engines powering the Apollo booster, as well as the J-2 liquid oxygen/hydrogen upper stage engine also used on the Project Apollo spacecraft. Nuclear and energy research and development. The Atomics International Division of North American Aviation utilized SSFL Area IV as the site of United States first commercial nuclear power plant and the testing and development of the SNAP-10A, the first nuclear reactor launched into outer space by the United States. Atomics International also operated the Energy Technology Engineering Center for the U.S. government. As overall interest in nuclear power declined, Atomics International transitioned to non-nuclear energy-related projects, such as coal gasification, and gradually ceased designing and testing nuclear reactors. Atomics International was eventually merged with the Rocketdyne division in 1978. Sodium reactor experiment. The Sodium Reactor Experiment-SRE was an experimental nuclear reactor which operated from 1957 to 1964 and was the first commercial power plant in the world to experience a core meltdown. There was a decades-long cover-up by the US Department of Energy. The operation predated environmental regulation, so early disposal techniques are not recorded in detail. Thousands of pounds of sodium coolant from the time of the meltdown are not yet accounted for. The reactor and support systems were removed in 1981 and the building torn down in 1999. Energy Technology Engineering Center. The Energy Technology Engineering Center-ETEC, was a government-owned, contractor-operated complex of industrial facilities located within Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The ETEC specialized in non-nuclear testing of components which were designed to transfer heat from a nuclear reactor using liquid metals instead of water or gas. The center operated from 1966 to 1998. The ETEC site has been closed and is now undergoing building removal and environmental remediation by the U.S. Department of Energy. Accidents and site contamination. Throughout the years, approximately ten low-power nuclear reactors operated at SSFL, in addition to several ""critical facilities"": a sodium burn pit in which sodium-coated objects were burned in an open pit; a plutonium fuel fabrication facility; a uranium carbide fuel fabrication facility; and the purportedly largest ""Hot Lab"" facility in the United States at the time. (A Hot Lab is a facility used for remotely cutting up irradiated nuclear fuel.) Irradiated nuclear fuel from other Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Department of Energy (DOE) facilities from around the country were shipped to SSFL to be decladded and examined. The Hot Lab suffered a number of fires involving radioactive materials. For example, in 1957, a fire in the Hot Cell ""got out of control and ... massive contamination"" resulted. (see: NAA-SR-1941, Sodium Graphite Reactor, Quarterly Progress Report, January–March 1957). In July, 1959, the site suffered a partial nuclear meltdown that has been named ""the worst in U.S. history"", releasing an undisclosed amount of radiation, but thought to be much more than the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979. Another radioactive fire occurred in 1971, involving combustible primary reactor coolant (NaK) contaminated with mixed fission products. At least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents. The AE6 reactor experienced a release of fission gases in March 1959, the SRE experienced a power excursion and partial meltdown in July 1959; the SNAP8ER in 1964 experienced damage to 80% of its fuel; and the SNAP8DR in 1969 experienced similar damage to one-third of its fuel. The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no containment structures. Reactors and highly radioactive components were housed without the large concrete domes that surround modern power reactors. Sodium burn pits. Other spills and releases occurred over the decades of operation as well. In 1989, a DOE investigation found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination on the property. Widely publicized in the local press, the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials, resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site, and the filing of lawsuits. Cleanup commenced, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was brought in at the request of local legislators to provide oversight. On July 26, 1994, two scientists, Otto K. Heiney, 52, of Chatsworth and Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks, were killed when the chemicals they were illegally burning in open pits exploded. After a grand jury investigation and FBI raid on the facility, three Rocketdyne officials pleaded guilty in June 2004 to illegally storing explosive materials. The jury deadlocked on the more serious charges related to illegal burning of hazardous waste. At trial, a retired Rocketdyne mechanic testified as to what he witnessed at the time of the explosion: ""I assumed we were burning waste,"" Wells testified, comparing the process used on July 21 and 26, 1994, to that once used to legally dispose of leftover chemicals at the company's old burn pit. As Heiney poured the chemicals for what would have been the third burn of the day, the blast occurred, Wells said. ""background noise was so loud I didn't hear anything ... I felt the blast and I looked down and my shirt was coming apart."" When he realized what had occurred, Wells said, ""I felt to see if I was all there ... I knew I was burned but I didn't know how bad."" Wildfires and contamination. In 2005, wildfires swept through northern Los Angeles County and parts of Ventura County. The fires consumed most of the dry brush throughout the Simi Hills where SSFL is located. The facility received substantial fire damage. Since the fire, allegations have emerged that vast quantities of on-site contamination were released into the air. Most recently, Los Angeles County firefighters who were assigned to SSFL during the fire have been sent for medical testing to see if any harmful doses were ingested or inhaled while protecting the facility. While community members and firefighters have expressed concern about the amount of exposure, Boeing officials stand by their position that no contamination of the air resulted from the fire, and that any contamination that may have been consumed by the fire was negligible. California Department of Toxic Substances Control also claims that no significant contamination occurred as a result of the fire. Although the Field Lab is under current criticism for violating almost 50 discharge permits, state agencies have been silent on the issue. Recently, lawyers disclosed to the California State Water Resources Control Board that over 80 exceedances of Boeing's discharge permits were found in the preceding year alone. In January 2006, the State Water Resources Control Board finally stepped in, and refused some requests by Boeing for even lighter standards. Medical claims. Also in October 2005, plaintiff Margaret-Ann Galasso, in a suit against Boeing criticized her attorneys, who, as she claimed, accepted a $30 million settlement with Boeing without her approval. The attorneys stand to collect $18 million, or 60% of the settlement amount after their costs and fees are subtracted. The plaintiff who disclosed the allegedly tainted deal is splitting the rest of the settlement with other plaintiffs and will only receive around $30,000, a far cry from the amount she will need for extensive future medical treatments for diseases that were linked to contamination from the SSFL facility. In October 2006, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Advisory Panel, made up of independent scientists and researchers from around the United States, concluded that contamination at the facility resulted in between 0 and 1,800 cancer deaths (the average estimate was 300 deaths). The report also concluded that the SRE meltdown caused the release of more than 458 times the amount of radiation released by the Three Mile Island accident.[http://ssflpanel.org] Cleanup project. During its years of operation widespread use occurred of highly toxic chemical additives to power over 30,000 rocket engine tests and to clean the rocket test-stands afterwards, as well as considerable nuclear research and at least four nuclear accidents, which has resulted in the SSFL becoming a seriously contaminated site and offsite pollution source requiring a sophisticated multi-agency and corporate Cleanup Project. A long process has been and is still ongoing to determine the site contamination levels and locations, cleanup standards to meet, methods to use, timelines and costs, and completion requirements - all still being defined, debated, and litigated. The Santa Susana Field Lab Cleanup Project is a very complex challenge: technically, logistically, politically, legally, and emotionally. Regarding cleanup, the site's current owner is Boeing, with NASA and DOE liable for several parcels within that. On August 2, 2005, Pratt & Whitney purchased Boeing's Rocketdyne division, but declined to acquire SSFL as part of the sale. Standards history. In 1989, the DOE found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination at their site, and a cleanup program commenced. In 1995 EPA and DOE announced that they had entered into a joint policy agreement to assure that all DOE sites would be cleaned up to standards consistent with the EPA's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) standards. However, in March 2003, the DOE reversed its position and announced that SSFL would not be cleaned up to EPA standards. While the DOE simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 joint policy agreement, the new plan included a cleanup of only 1% of the contaminated soil, and the release of SSFL for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years. The EPA responded to this announcement by claiming that the DOE was not subject to EPA regulation due to the fact that the DOE existed as a separate entity under the executive branch of the federal government, and refused take steps to force DOE adherence to the 1995 agreement. In August 2003, the Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report on Energy and Water Appropriations, urging the DOE to meet its commitments in the 1995 agreement and clean up SSFL to the EPA's CERCLA standards. The DOE responded to the Senate, claiming it was in fact consistent with both the agreement and EPA's CERCLA standards. In December 2003, soon after DOE's announcement that it was consistent with the 1995 agreement, EPA determined that the cleanup was not consistent with its CERCLA standards, and that sufficient contamination would remain at levels that would be dangerously inappropriate for unrestricted residential, and that the only safe use under DOE's revised cleanup standards would be restricted day hikes with limitations on picnicking. Critics point out that if the DOE-Boeing cleanup plan was followed through and the site was released for unrestricted residential use, the property would likely become a Superfund site subject to EPA standards. After the sale, the site would no longer be a DOE facility, and thus, the exemption from CERCLA standards would no longer be in effect. The end result being that the site would only be brought into compliance with CERCLA cleanup standards after Boeing has sold the property, relieving the company of any burden of cleanup costs. The costs would likely be passed on to taxpayers, and not those responsible for the actual contamination.  In early May 2007, a Federal Court in San Francisco issued a major ruling which concluded that DOE has not been cleaning up the site to proper standards, and that the site would have to be cleaned up to higher standards if DOE ever wanted to release the site to Boeing, which in turn, would most likely release the land for unrestricted residential development. Judge ""Conti's ruling requires DOE to prepare a more stringent review of the lab, which is on the border of Los Angeles County. Conti wrote that the department's decision to prepare a less-stringent environmental document prior to cleanup is in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and noted that the lab 'is located only miles away from one of the largest population centers in the world.'"" Runoff issues. On July 26, 2007, staff at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board recommended a $471,190 fine against Boeing for 79 violations of the California Water Code during an 18-month period. From October 2004 to January 2006, wastewater and storm water runoff coming from the lab had increased levels of chromium, dioxin, lead, mercury and other pollutants, the board said. The contaminated water flowed into Bell Creek and the Los Angeles River in violation of a July 1, 2004, permit that allowed release of wastewater and storm water runoff as long as it didn't contain high levels of pollutants. Parkland. On October 15, 2007, Boeing announced that ""In a landmark agreement between Boeing and California officials, nearly of land that is currently Boeing's Santa Susana Field Laboratory will become state parkland. According to the plan jointly announced by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Boeing, and state Sen. Sheila Kuehl, the property will be donated and preserved as a vital undeveloped open-space link in the Simi Hills, above the Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley. The agreement will permanently restrict the land for nonresidential, noncommercial use."" New cleanup developments. SB 990. The California state senate bill SB 990, passed into law in 2007, set the standards for the site's cleanup. To achieve them the R.P.s, or responsible parties consisting of Boeing, DOE, and NASA, need to sign agreements of acceptance and cleanup compliance. Boeing. Boeing has contested the law, filing a lawsuit in September 2009 to release it from compliance, with a court date set for summer 2011. DOE and NASA. In September 2010 DOE and NASA agreed to meet the stringent cleanup standards set for the site in the state's SB 990 legislation, and to cover all costs for their cleanup's implementation. This agreement is significant progress in the SSFL cleanup sequence. The cleanup is projected to be completed in 2017. Community involvement. PPG - Public Participation Group. The CA-DTSC: SSFL Project, the lead regulatory agency for the site cleanup, is forming a new 2010 PPG - Public Participation Group, in response to their community 'Listening Sessions' held earlier in the year and the proposed Listening Session Response Plan. Applications from all the 'stakeholder' I.P.s - interested parties: the public, community groups, neighbors, local environmental and cultural groups, and others are being accepted currently 2010. SSFL Workgroup. Every quarter the SSFL Workgroup meetings regarding the cleanup are held that are open for public attendance. The SSFL Workgroup is the current version of the The Santa Susana Advisory Panel. The workgroup consists of representatives from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, the U.S. EPA., public policy organizations, and community representatives. The Boeing Company, current owner of the SSFL site, the DOE are also invited. Other organizations and private companies also attend as part of the workgroup depending on the topic pending. The meetings are usually held at The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, and are posted on the DTSC-SSFL Calendar page of their website. Community advisory group. A petition to form a ""CAG"" or community advisory group was denied in March 2010 by DTSC . "
wikipedia-2344243," Florence Stanley  Florence Stanley (July 1, 1924 – October 3, 2003) was an American actress of stage, film, and television. Early life and career. Florence Stanley was born as Florence Schwartz in Chicago, the daughter of Hanna (née Weil) and Jack Schwartz. She began a long career on stage, film and TV starting in the 1940s. Her earliest theatrical performances include ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" with the Touring Players, ""Bury The Dead"" at New York's Cherry Lane Theatre, and ""Machinal"". During the 1950s, Stanley appeared in numerous live TV shows, and gave an acclaimed performance as Clytemnestra in the New York Shakespeare Festival's 1964 production of ""Electra"", opposite Lee Grant, who played the title role. Stanley began her long career on Broadway as Maureen Stapleton's understudy in a 1965 revival of ""The Glass Menagerie"".

wikipedia-2322171," Ukrainian Premier League  The Ukrainian Premier League () is the highest division of Ukrainian annual football championship. As the Supreme League (""Vyshcha Liha"") it was formed in 1991 upon discontinuation of the Soviet championship and included the Ukrainian based clubs that competed in the Soviet competitions. In 1996 along with all the professional football leagues of Ukraine, the Supreme League became a member of the Professional Football League of Ukraine. In 2008 it was reformed into a more autonomous entity of both the Professional League and the Football Federation of Ukraine, officially changing its name to the current one. Its rank was 7th highest in Europe as rated by UEFA as of May 2013. Among Ukrainian fans the most popular Ukrainian clubs are Dynamo Kyiv (by far most popular) and Shakhtar Donetsk. Far behind those two are trailing Metalist Kharkiv, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Karpaty Lviv and Chornomorets Odesa. Overview. The season 2013–14 is the league's sixth after the break-away from the Professional Football League (PFL) in 2008 and 23rd season from the break-up of the Soviet Top League. Until 2007 the league was subsidized by the government and from an economic point of view was not a profitable organization. To solve that issue, the League have tried to attract a few sponsors since the 2007 season: ""Soyuz-Viktan""(2007) and ""Biola""(2008). On 15 April 2008 the new Premier-League was formed. Since its formation the title sponsor of the League became the national network of the construction supermarkets EpiCentre K. The new sports organization is a completely independent entity and consists of 16 football club organizations under the guidance of the Football Federation of Ukraine. With the new reorganization the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were exclusively administrative. The teams that reach the top of the competition table at the end of each season as always gain the chance to represent Ukraine internationally in several prestigious tournaments (continental club tournaments). Also at the end of the season, the bottom two clubs are relegated to the First League (supervised by the Professional Football League) and replaced by the two top clubs from that league. All the participants of the Premier League enter the National Cup competition at the round of 32 (1/16th of the final) stage. Also the winner of the League at the beginning of every next season plays against the winner of the National Cup for the Ukrainian Super Cup. As of 2013, Shakhtar Donetsk is the reigning Ukrainian Premier League champion. To summarise, Tavriya Simferopol won the first championship, while all the subsequent titles have gone to either Dynamo Kyiv or Shakhtar Donetsk. Only 4 teams, Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Tavriya Simferopol have participated in all 23 Ukrainian Vyshcha Liha competitions. The league cooperates with the Professional Football League of Ukraine which governs the lower divisions. The PFL is an association that represents 49 Ukrainian professional football clubs, which are represented by 51 teams (only 2 clubs now have more than one team which plays in different divisions). The professional league was organized in 1996 and until 2008 was responsible for the competitions in the Top division as well. Before that, Vyshcha Liha was governed solely and directly by the Football Federation of Ukraine. ""Biola"" is a beverage making and bottling company and is the general sposor of Dnipro. Emblem. The emblem depicts a football that is wrapped around by the blue-yellow stripe (the national colors of Ukraine) on the blue background. Across the top and around the ball there are 16 stars that represent the league's participants. On the bottom the script says ""Premier-League - Union of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine"". Season regulations. Season regulations is one of the two most important documents (other being the competition calendar) that are adopted by the Premier League prior to each season. Premier League directly organizes and conducts competitions among member clubs. Competitions are conducted on principle of ""Fair play"" and according to competitions calendar which is approved by the Premier League General Assembly and the FFU Executive Committee 30 days before start of competitions. Until 2019 all advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of games of championship and cup belong to the club that hosts them (except for the Ukrainian Cup final, the Super Cup of Ukraine, and the ""Gold game""). All advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of the Ukrainian Cup final belong to the Football Federation of Ukraine, while the game of Super Cup and the ""Gold game"" - to the Premier League. There are 16 club members of the league. All participants get approved by the Premier League General Assembly. Each club fields each team for senior competitions, and competitions for under 21 and under 19 teams (three teams). A club is required to have a stadium (registered with FFU) and an education and training facility (or center). A club also obligated to finance its own youth sports institution and a complex scientific-methodical group as well as to own and finance number of youth teams. A Premier League club needs to ensure participation of at least four youth teams (ages groups between 14 and 17) in the Youth Football League of Ukraine. A club cannot field more than one team for a certain competition. All club's staff members (coaches, physicians, massage specialists) have to be contracted and be UEFA licensed. All coaches should have A-diploma, while head coaches - PRO-diploma. Football players are listed in ""A"" and ""B"" rosters. ""A"" roster contains no more than 25 players, while ""B"" roster has unlimited number of players no older than 21 who have professional contact or agreement for sports training. The 25-players ""A"" roster includes the number of slots allotted for players developed by the club. During breaks in competitions in summer and winter there are two periods for registering players. A championship is conducted after the round robin system in two cycles ""fall-spring"" with one game at home and another at opponent's field with each participant. A competition calender is formed after a draw that is conducted based on the Premier League club rankings. The calendar of the second cycle repeats the first, while hosting teams are switched. There should be no less than two calendar days between official games of a club. All games take place between 12:00 and 22:00 local time. Any game postponement is allowed only in emergencies and on decision of the Premier League Administration (Dyrektsiya). Game forfeitures are controlled by technical win/loss nominations and fines, followed by additional sanctions of the FFU Control-Disciplinary Committee, and possible elimination from the league. History. The first decade (1992–2000). Prior to 1992, the championship of Ukraine was conducted by the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR. There were two championships, the championship among the masters' teams () and among the fitness clubs (). Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the inaugural independent championship took place hastily at the start of spring 1992 after the creation of the Ukrainian Supreme League (, Vyshcha Liha). The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the Soviet Top League, two teams from the Soviet First League, and nine out of the eleven Ukrainian teams from the Soviet Second League. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian First League as they were to be relegated anyway. The two best teams of the Soviet Second League B of the ""Ukrainian Zone"" were also placed in the Supreme League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup which finished ninth in the same group (Soviet Second League B). The 20 participants were split into two groups with the winners playing for the championship title and the runners-up playing for third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As expected, the five favorites, ""Dynamo Kyiv"", ""Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk"", ""Shakhtar Donetsk"", ""Chornomorets Odesa"", and ""Metalist Kharkiv"" finished at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in Lviv, a sensation took place as Tavriya Simferopol beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Crimeans earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far their only one), losing only once to Temp Shepetivka. After being stunned in the first championship by the ""tragedy"" in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv were anxious to earn their first title at the second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, who were top after the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had a better goal difference. Neither the ""Golden match"", nor the fact that Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk had a better head-to-head record was considered. The next seven years were known as the total domination of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period 'the main Soviet protagonists' had changed as some of the best teams were facing a crisis. After the 1993–94 season Metalist Kharkiv were surprisingly relegated to the First League. In the 1995–96 season Shakhtar Donetsk had the worst year in the club's history, coming tenth. Chornomorets Odesa were relegated twice during that first decade after which manager Leonid Buryak was sacked. A few newly created teams have since emerged such as Arsenal Kyiv and Metalurh Donetsk, as well as Vorskla Poltava, who surprisingly came third in the club's first season at the Top Level in the 1997. The decade of Kyiv–Donetsk stand-off (2001–2010). The Ukrainian derby. The next decade was marked by fierce competition between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Shakhtar Donetsk has proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo Kyiv is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ""miners"" history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, Nevio Scala, who managed to secure the Ukrainian Cup title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases. The FFU and PFL worked together to solve that issue, coming up with a plan to force the ""transitional"" limitation of foreign players over time. The clubs such as Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Chornomorets Odesa, who were recent contenders for the title, had to put up a fierce fight against the newly established contenders Metalurh Donetsk and Metalist Kharkiv to qualify for the European competitions. Metalist Kharkiv shone brightly in the late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing right behind Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to face Dynamo Kyiv to earn a place in the quarter-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, but lost on the away goals rule. That same 2008–09 UEFA Cup competition was won for the first time by Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league. In the 2008-2009 season the league earned the highest UEFA league coefficient in Europe for that season. On the political side of the League it was transformed on 15 April 2008 into an autonomous entity, parting away from the PFL. The Premier League has been split since the moment it was created in regards to its president. The dispute went as far as even canceling the 13th round of 2009–10 season and moving it to the spring half, while having the 14th round still playing in the fall. The representatives of five clubs: Arsenal Kyiv, Dynamo Kyiv, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih, and Metalist Kharkiv have been boycotting most of the League meetings, not complying with its financial obligations and giving the broadcasting rights to TV-channels other than the League official supplier. They justified their actions due to what they deem to be the illegal election of the Premier League president. The representatives of the above-mentioned clubs did not recognize the election in 2008 of Vitaliy Danilov as the president and believed that the elections should have been won by Vadim Rabinovich. To resolve this conflict Vitaliy Danilov instigated the re-election of the Premier League president in September 2009, and on 1 December 2009 won the election again with 11 clubs voting for his candidature, 3 were against, 1 abstained, and 1 was absent. This time most club presidents of the Premier League of Ukraine acknowledged Vitaliy Danilov legality. In the subsequent elections on 9 December 2011 Vitaliy Danilov was challenged by Andriy Kurhanskyi (through the proposal of Karpaty Lviv). The other available candidates, Miletiy Balchos (president of the Professional Football League of Ukraine) and Yuriy Kindzerskyi, were not picked by any members of the Premier League. Vitaliy Danilov managed to retain his seat with nine votes for him. International Relations. In 2009 The Ukrainian Premier League joined the European Professional Football Leagues. Also in 2009 the league signed a partnership with IMG of which during the first month of cooperation sold broadcasting rights for the Ukrainian Cup to Poland and Armenia. On its own initiative the Ukrainian Premier League sold broadcasting rights to Romania and Russia as well. Competition calendar. Clubs play each other twice (once at home and once away) to make up the 30-match season. The league begins in mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 15 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus, the winter break is significantly longer than the interval between seasons. This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European leagues in terms of the beginning and the end of the season. The first season of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted only half a year. This was because the last Soviet league season ended in the autumn of 1991, and the Football Federation of Ukraine decided to shift the calendar from “spring-fall” to “fall-spring” football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which Tavriya Simferopol surprised the pre-season favorite Dynamo Kyiv. After the first season, in each of the following seasons each team played each other team in the League twice. The number of participating teams fluctuated between 14 and 18, stabilizing since 2002–03 season at 16. As of the 2005–06 season, the golden match rule was introduced. According to the rule, if the first two teams obtain the same number of points, the championship is to be decided by an additional ""golden"" match between the two teams. In fact, in that season Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk had earned the same number of points and Shakhtar won the championship by winning the golden match (2:1 after extra time). Players. Prior to 2000, only a handful of foreign players represented Ukrainian clubs, and even those players were mostly from countries that were once a part of the Soviet Union. However, in 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Vyshcha Liha tallied more than 30 players and by 2003–04 season, the figure had increased to 37% of the league's players. Only 2 players from Ukraine's domestic leagues competed in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, while at the 2006 FIFA World Cup the Vyshcha Liha was the 6th-most represented league with 25 players in the competition, including 17 of the 23 players in Ukraine's squad. As a result of this increase in foreign-born players, clubs in the Vyshcha Liha are allowed to field no more than seven foreigners at one time from this season and this limit is expected to be lowered to six foreigners. In addition, clubs are subject to a $15,000 fine upon acquiring a foreign player. One of the biggest proponents of the foreigner limit was the national team coach Oleh Blokhin, who threatened to quit the national team if the limit was not made stricter. The clubs mainly affected by this rule include the few clubs that participate annually in European competitions. They argue that the foreigner limit is detrimental to the development of Ukrainian football in general. However, as a result of this limit, these clubs have had to increase their efforts in finding and training Ukrainian talent that is good enough to represent these teams. The foreigner limit itself has also been recently contested by several cases, but primarily by one filed by a Georgian national Giorgi Demetradze, who argued that the limit impeded his working rights and is illegal under the Constitution of Ukraine. The courts however argued that no case exists due to the fact that players are not guaranteed first-team football, and subsequently the limit is not considered a violation of trade. Status regulations and transfers. Status and transfer policy of football players and staff in Ukraine is regulated by the Football Federation of Ukraine which primarily follows Article 5 of the FIFA statute, other respective regulations of FIFA, and the laws of Ukraine (see FFU regulations of player's status and transfer, 2010 edition). Any footballer that takes part in FFU competition has either the status of amateur or professional. A professional footballer is considered to be a player that has a written contract with a club and receives a salary for his services that surpasses his virtual expenditures. The professional status of footballer prevents him from competing at amateur level. The footballer receives a professional status and the respective rights and obligations according to the following conditions: The footballer who does not receive the above-mentioned salary and does not have a contract with a professional club is considered an amateur. A player that is registered as a professional cannot obtain an amateur status within 30 days of his last official game as a professional. A club cannot request compensation for a player from the club where the player obtained amateur status. However, each professional player after the expiration of his contract with a certain professional club is still registered for 30 months with that club which may apply for compensation. The 30 month term is defined from the time of his last official game for that club. Each coach of a professional club team is required to receive a respective attestation organized by FFU. Each sports doctor and masseur of a professional club are required to receive a certificate from the Ukrainian Ministry of Health with the specialization ""Sport doctor"" and ""Specialist in sport massage"". A player is allowed to sign his first contract at 15 years of age with parental consent of no more than three years. A regular contract cannot be for more than five years. A football player that is registered with other associations than FFU cannot take part in any competitions in Ukraine until he is registered with the Football Federation of Ukraine. A football player of a foreign association and aged 12 years or older is required to submit an International transfer certificate in order to be registered with FFU. Registration and transfers are conducted during one of the two ""registration periods"" (transfer window): one is after the conclusion of a season and start of the next not exceeding a twelve-week period, and another in mid-season of no more than a four-week period. There are no set dates for the registration periods. 2013–14 Ukrainian Premier League. In the 2013–14 season, the Ukrainian Premier League consists of the following teams: Broadcasting. Free-to-air live matches from the Ukrainian Premier League will be broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays on satellite channel 2+2 (Sirius 5E).

In European Football, teams are especially honored for winning multiple league titles. A representative star is placed above the team's badge to indicate 10 league titles. Dynamo Kyiv became the first Ukrainian team to achieve the prestigious honor of winning the Soviet Top League for the 10th time in 1981. Dynamo Kyiv after having entered the Ukrainian championship has become the same dominant leader as during the Soviet times by earning its 20th national title at the top level in 1999. No other club in Ukraine has come close to such an honour yet. Only four other clubs have ever been national champions: Shakhtar Donetsk (8, all Ukrainian titles), Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk (2, all Soviet), and once Zorya Luhansk (Soviet Union) and Tavriya Simferopol (Ukraine). The current (as of June 2012) officially sanctioned Premier League stars are: Premier League Players. Ex-Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv striker Serhiy Rebrov holds the record for most Ukrainian Premier League goals with 123, despite winning the top single season scorer title only once. Since the first Ukrainian Premier League season in 1992, 20 different players have won or shared the top scorer's title. Only three players have won the title more than once, Tymerlan Huseynov, Maksim Shatskikh and Yevhen Seleznyov. Serhiy Rebrov and Maksim Shatskikh hold the record for most goals in a season (22) and are the only two players to score at least 20 goals twice. The most prolific single season scorers are Ivan Hetsko and Andriy Shevchenko, respectively attaining 0.59 and 0.51 goals per game. Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk are the only teams to have scored 1,000 goals in the Ukrainian Premier League having achieved the feat in the 2006–07 season and 2007–08 season, respectively. League managers. With the ongoing Shakhtar Donetsk champion's run, Mircea Lucescu set a record of winning league titles in the Ukrainian Premier League surpassing the Ukrainian and Soviet legendary coach Valeriy Lobanovsky. A notice is deserved by Myron Markevych who coached most of the games in the league yet not winning a single title as well as Mykola Pavlov who however earned one title with Dynamo Kyiv. † – Managers that have retired out of sport.

wikipedia-2322181," Postosuchus  Postosuchus, meaning ""crocodile from Post"", is an extinct genus of rauisuchian reptiles comprising two species, ""P. kirkpatricki"" and ""P. alisonae"", that lived in what is now North America during the Middle and Late Triassic (about 228-202 million years ago). ""Postosuchus"" is a member of the clade Pseudosuchia, the lineage of archosaurs that includes modern crocodilians (the other main group of archosaurs is Avemetatarsalia, the lineage that includes non-avian dinosaurs and their descendants, birds). Its name refers to Post Quarry, a place in Texas where many fossils of the type species, ""P. kirkpatricki"", were found. It was one of the apex predators of its area during the Triassic, larger than the small dinosaur predators of its time (such as ""Coelophysis""). It was a hunter which probably preyed on dicynodonts and many other creatures smaller than itself. The skeleton of ""Postosuchus"" is large and robust with a deep skull and a long tail. The total body length is about . Although the heavy build of the skeleton suggests that ""Postosuchus"" walked on all four limbs, the extreme shortness of the forelimbs relative to the hind limbs is a strong indication that ""Postosuchus"" was able to walk on two legs and may even have been committed to bipedal locomotion. Description. General description. ""Postosuchus"" was one of the largest carnivorous reptiles during the late Triassic. Adults reached around in length from snout to tail tip and their mass might have ranged from . It had a massively built skull bearing dagger-like teeth. The neck was elongated, expanding to a short torso and long tail. Posture. Each one of ""Postosuchus""'s two forelimbs was slightly over half the size of the hindlimbs. This characteristic of short forelimbs can usually be seen in bipedal reptiles. Chatterjee suggested that ""Postosuchus"" could walk in an erect stance, since the short forelimbs were probably used only during slow locomotion. However, in 1995 Robert Long and Phillip A Murry stated that ""Postosuchus"" was heavily built and quadrupedal. There is debate over whether ""Postosuchus"" was bipedal or quadrupedal and scientists aren't certain, yet, about its gait. However, it has also been suggested by some palaeontologists that ""Postosuchus"" might possibly have been a facultative biped, meaning that it alternated between walking bipedally, occasionally, and quadrupedally. Skull. The skull of ""Postosuchus"" was constructed narrow in front and extended wide and deep behind. It was 55 cm in length and 21 cm broad and deep. There are many fenestrae (openings) present in the bones that lighten the skull, providing space for the muscles. Like more derived archosaurs, the lower jaw had mandibular fenestrae (openings at the lower jaw), formed by the junction of the dentary with other jaw bones (surangular and angular). ""Postosuchus"" had very good long distant sight, due to large orbits, supporting large and sharp eyes, and strong olfaction provided by elongated nostrils. Inside the skull, under the nostrils, there was a hollowing that probably was for the Jacobson's organ, an olfactory sensory organ sometimes referred as the ""sixth sense"". The jaws held large and sharp serrated teeth and in some points were developed even larger to operate as hooked sabers. A complete tooth found among ""Postosuchus"" remains in North Carolina measured about 7.2 cm in height. ""Postosuchus"" possessed heterodonty dentition, which means each tooth was different in size and shape from the others. The upper jaw composed of seventeen teeth, with each premaxilla bore only four teeth and each maxilla thirteen teeth. In the lower jaw were counted over thirty teeth. Replacement activity in ""Postosuchus"" was different from that of crocodiles, since the replacement tooth didn't fit directly in the pulp cavity of the old tooth, but grew until resorption of the old tooth was complete. Postcranial anatomy. The neck of ""Postosuchus"" consists of at least eight cervical vertebrae followed by sixteen dorsals, while four co-ossified sacral vertebrae supported the hips. It is thought to be over thirty vertebrae in the tail decreasing in size to the end. The pelvis with the hooked pubis and the rod-like ischium looked like those of carnosaur dinosaurs. Along with remains of the skeleton, paleontologists also identify osteoderms, which were thick plates forming scales. These were on its back, neck, and possibly above or under the tail. The ribcage of ""Postosuchus"" had typical archosaur structure, composed of large and slender, curved ribs. In some discoveries ribs were found associated with gastralia, dermal bones which located in the ventral region of the body. The limbs were located underneath the body giving ""Postosuchus"" an upright stance. With the forelimbs being approximately 64% of the hindlimbs, ""Postosuchus"" had small hands bearing five toes. Only the first toe bore a large claw, which was used as an offensive weapon, and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. Peyer et al. 2008, argued that the thick pectoral girdle served for locomotion of the forelimbs. However, this doesn't detract from the theory that ""Postosuchus"" could walk bipedally. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The halluxes were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones couldn't touch the ground. As crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of ""Postosuchus"" resemble those of modern crocodiles. History. Originally, it was thought that the fossils of ""Postosuchus"" belonged to a dinosaur. Remains of ""Postosuchus"" were discovered for the first time in Crosby County, Texas, and described by paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case in 1922. The fossils were composed only of an isolated braincase (UM 7473) and fragments of pelvic bones (UM 7244). Case then mistakenly assigned these specimens to the dinosaur genus ""Coelophysis"". In the case of the braincase later assigned to ""Postosuchus"", in 2002 paleontologist David J. Gower argued that the specimen is not complete and may belong to an ornithodire. Between 1932 and 1934, Case discovered other fossils of caudal vertebrae (UMMP 13670) in Rotten Hill, Texas, and a complete pelvis (UCMP V72183/113314) near Kalgary, Texas. Within the same period, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp collected over a hundred 'rauisuchian' bones, from what is now the Petrified Forest National Park of Arizona, which belong to at least seven individuals (UCMP A296, MNA 207C). Later, more remains came to light. In 1943, Case again described a pelvis along with a pubis (UM 23127) from the Dockum Group of Texas, which dates from the Carnian through the early Norian stages of Late Triassic period. These early findings, from 1932 to 1943, were initially referred to as a new phytosaur reptile, but assigned forty years later to ""Postosuchus"". During an expedition in 1980, paleontologists of the Texas Tech University discovered a new geological site rich in fossils near Post Town, Garza County, Texas, where a dozen of well preserved specimens belonging to a new rauisuchian were found. In the following years further excavation in the Post Quarry, in Cooper Canyon Formation (Dockum Group), unearthed many remains of late Triassic terrestrial fauna. The holotype of ""P. kirkpatricki"" (TTUP 9000), representing a well-preserved skull and a partial postcranial skeleton, was described along with other findings of this new genus by paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee in 1985. A paratype, TTU-P 9002, representing a well-preserved skull and a complete skeleton was also assigned to this species. Chatterjee named the species after Mr. and Mrs. Jack Kirkpatrick who helped during his fieldwork. During more recent research, paleontologists suggested that some bones (such manus and toe bones) described by Chatterjee back in 1985 as parts of the holotype, are eventually a combination of remains belonging to ""Chatterjeea"", ""Lythrosuchus"", and ""Postosuchus"". Long and Murry also pointed out that many of the juvenile skeletons (TTUP 9003-9011), which Chatterjee assigned to ""P. kirkpatricki"", belong to a distinct genus, named ""Chatterjeea elegans"". Furthermore, in 2006 Nesbitt and Norell argued that ""Chatterjeea"" is a junior synonym of ""Shuvosaurus"". The first articulated skeleton referred to ""P. kirkpatricki"" (CM 73372) was recovered by David S. Berman of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Coelophysis Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, between 1988 and 1989. This specimen was composed of a well preserved skeleton without skull and was described by Long and Murry in 1995, Weinbaum in 2002 and Novak in 2004. The specimen represents a skeletally immature individual because none of the neural sutures are closed. It was referred to ""P. kirkpatricki"" by Long and Murry (1995) without specific justification, and more recent studies accepted this referral. Nevertheless, Nesbitt (2011) noted that these studies failed to note any synapomorphies unique to ""P. kirkpatricki"" and CM 73372. Weinbaum (2002) and Novak (2004) even noted that the preacetabular process of the ilium in CM 73372 was much longer than that of ""P. kirkpatricki"". Nesbitt (2011) also noted that CM 73372 differs from ""P. kirkpatricki"" and ""Rauisuchus"" in possessing a concave ventral margin of the ilium, and from ""P. alisonae"" in processing an asymmetrical distal end of the fourth metatarsal. Nesbitt (2011) couldn't differentiate CM 73372 and ""Polonosuchus"" as they overlap only in the caudal vertebrae. A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Nesbitt (2011), one of the most extensive on archosaurs, found CM 73372 to be the most basal crocodylomorph, thus referable neither to ""P. kirkpatricki"" nor to Rauisuchidae. In 2008, Peyer ""et al."", described a new species of ""Postosuchus"", ""P. alisonae"", which was discovered in 1992 in Triangle Brick Co. Quarry, Durham County, North Carolina. The remains were prepared and reconstructed between 1994 and 1998 by the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of North Carolina. The specific name is in reference to Alison L. Chambers, who worked to popularize paleontology in North Carolina. The skeleton of ""P. alisonae"" consists of a few cranial bones, seven neck, one back, and four tail vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (""belly ribs""), chevrons, bony scutes, much of the shoulder girdles, most of the forelimbs except the left wrist and hand, most of the hindlimbs except for the thigh bones, and pieces from the hip. Moreover, the well preserved remains of ""P. alisonae"" shed new light on parts of ""Postosuchus"" anatomy, which were previously not well known. Specifically, the differences between the manus bones of ""P. kirkpatricki"" and ""P. alisonae"" confirm the chimera theory (associated fossils belonging to different animals) suggested by Long and Murry. The holotype specimen of ""P. alisonae"" (UNC 15575) is also unusual in its preservation of gut contents: bones from at least four other animals, including a partial skeleton of an aetosaur, a snout, coracoid, and humerus of the traversodontid cynodont ""Plinthogomphodon"", two phalanges from a dicynodont, and a possible temnospondyl bone. Furthermore, the ""Postosuchus"" was positioned on top of a skeleton of the sphenosuchian ""Dromicosuchus"", which included tooth marks on the skull and neck. ""P. alisonae"" represents the largest suchian reptile recovered from the quarry and the first articulated specimen of 'rauisuchian' archosaur found in eastern North America. Paleoecology. ""Postosuchus"" lived in a tropical environment. The moist and warm region consisted of ferns, such as ""Cynepteris"", ""Phelopteris"" and ""Clathropteris"", gymnosperms, represented by ""Pelourdea"", ""Araucarioxylon"", ""Woodworthia"", ""Otozamites"" and ""Dinophyton"", and cycads like ""Sanmiguelia"". Plants of the Dockum Group are not well known since the oxidizing of the environment has destroyed most of the plant fossils. However, some of them may provide information about the climate in Dockum Group during the late Triassic period. For example, the discovery of large specimens belonging to ""Araucarioxylon"" determine that the region was well watered. The fauna found in Dockum Group confirm that were lakes and/or rivers which contain fish like the cartilaginous ""Xenacanthus"", the lobe-finned ""Chinlea"" and the dipnoan ""Ceratodus"". On the shores of these rivers lived labyrinthodonts (""Latiscopus"") and reptiles such as ""Malerisaurus"" and ""Trilophosaurus"". Also living in the margin of the lakes were the archosaurs ""Parasuchus"", ""Nicrosaurus"" and ""Rutiodon"". ""Postosuchus"" lived in the uplands along with ""Coelophysis"" and other archosaurs such as ""Desmatosuchus"" and ""Typothorax"". ""Postosuchus"" was one of the largest animals in that ecosystem and preyed on herbivores such as ""Trilophosaurus"" and ""Typothorax"". In popular culture. ""Postosuchus"" appears in the first program of the BBC's series ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", where CGI animation was used to recreate extinct creatures of the Mesozoic era. In this episode, it appears as the top predator of the Late Triassic Period, preying on ""Placerias"", which are large dicynodonts. "
wikipedia-2322187," Butterfly kick  A butterfly kick or horse kick (xuànzi 旋子 circle) is a jumping kick in martial arts such as modern wushu and taekwondo and capoeira. Although the specific nature of the kick varies, it is generally composed of a twist of the body while both legs are lifted from the ground and swung around, while the torso remains as horizontal as possible. In action cinema it is often seen as a kick used to ""cut a swathe"" through multiple opponents. In traditional Chinese longfist, it is used defensively to evade an opponent's floor sweep and land on the enemy's vulnerable side. There are many variations, and different movements may be captured under the same name or likewise similar movements given under a different name depending on the martial arts school or style. It can be executed either from standing or from a step up run. The name ""butterfly kick"" is due to the legs reaching the apex of their arc the arms are stretched out, leaving all limbs extended in a position similar to that of a butterfly's wings in-flight.  Variants. There are many butterfly kick variants, as each student adopts slightly different maneuvers and style depending on his specific martial arts background. For example, a wushu-derived butterfly kick would be somewhat more graceful compared to a tae kwon do-derived kick, which would have a more dynamic, energetic look. Multi-rotation variants. Some variants add additional rotation(s) to the standard Butterfly twist. The extra twisting generally requires faster twisting of the body, more torque and extra height in order to land safely. Popularity. The spectacular appearance that is both graceful and powerful as from its martial arts origin has made the Butterfly kick versatile in a wide range of performing arts such as breakdancing, tricking, martial arts films, various video games (such as the Tekken series, the Mortal Kombat series and The Matrix Online), gymnastics and even on the ice as seen in Olympics figure skating. It has also appeared in the sport of professional wrestling by trained martial artists like Low Ki. It also appeared in """" as one of Darth Maul's signature techniques, Ray Park being a wushu champion. Though not as well known as some of the other tricking moves such as aerials and flips, the Butterfly kick holds a unique position in the acrobatic world for being a traditional defensive move incorporated into the modern popular arts and international sports.

wikipedia-2322219," Epidemic dropsy  Epidemic dropsy is a form of edema of extremities due to intoxication with ""Argemone mexicana"" (Mexican prickly poppy). Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with ""Argemone mexicana"" seed oil. Sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine are two major toxic alkaloids of argemone oil, which cause widespread capillary dilatation, proliferation and increased capillary permeability. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidentally with argemone oil, proteinuria (specifically loss of albumin) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in nephrotic syndrome. Other major symptoms are bilateral pitting edema of extremities, headache, nausea, loose bowels, erythema, glaucoma and breathlessness. Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of edema. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative hypovolemia with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and orthopnoea, progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure, are seen.  Mild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal azotemia, retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment. Epidemic dropsy occurs as an epidemic in places where use of mustard oil, (from the seeds of Brassica ""juncea"" commonly known as Indian mustard ) as cooking medium is common. Prevalence. Besides India, widespread epidemics have been reported from Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Northwest Cape districts of South Africa, Madagascar and also from Nepal. Apart from a South African study, where the epidemic occurred through contamination in wheat flour, all the epidemics occurred through the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil. In these populations mustard oil is the prime edible oil by culture. The earliest reference to argemone oil poisoning was made by Lyon, who reported four cases of poisoning in Calcutta in 1877 from the use of this oil in food. Since then, Epidemic Dropsy has been reported from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam, J&K, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, mainly due to consumption of food cooked in argemone oil mixed with mustard oil or occasionally by body massage with contaminated oil. The epidemic in 1998 at New Delhi, India is the largest so far, in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized. Even after that the epidemics occurred at alarming frequency in Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005) cities of India. ""Argemone mexicana"" Linn. Argemone mexicana (family Papaveraceae), a native of West Indies and naturalized in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and are similar to the dark coloured mustards seeds (Brassica juncea) in shape and size. Adulteration of argemone seeds in light yellow colored mustard seeds (Brassica compestris) can easily be detected, but these seeds are rather difficult to visualize when mixed with dark coloured mustard seeds. Argemone seeds yield approximately 35% oil. Alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0.44% to 0.50%. Argemone seeds find use as a substitute because of the easy availability, low cost and their complete miscibility of their oil with mustard oil. Mechanism of toxicity. Mortality is usually due to heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or renal failure and is around 5%.Long-term follow-up studies are scanty so the long-term effects of argemone oil toxicity have not been documented. Its been reported that 25% of cases will have oedema beyond 2 months and 10% beyond 5 months.Pigmentation of skin and excessive loss of hair, which lasted 4–5 months following the disease. The majority of patients completely recover in about 3 months. ROS and Oxidative stress : Studies in the blood of dropsy patients has revealed that there is extensive ROS production (singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) in the argemone oil intoxication leading to depletion of total antioxidants in the body and especially lipid soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and A (tocopherol and retinol). There is an extensive damage to the anti-oxidant defense system (anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-oxidants) of blood. Prior, in vitro studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in AO induced toxicity causing peroxidative damage of lipids in various hepatic sub-cellular fractions including microsomes and mitochondria of rats. The damage in hepatic microsomal membrane causes loss of activity of cytochrome P-450 and other membrane bound enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism which leads to delayed bioelimination of sanguinarine and enhances its cumulative toxicity. Several lines of evidence have been shown to explain the mechanism of toxicity of argemone oil/alkaloid. The toxicity of sanguinarine has been shown to be dependent on the reactivity of its iminium bond with nucleophilic sites like thiol groups, present at the active sites of the enzymes and other vital proteins and thus suggesting the electrophilic nature of the alkaloid.  Pulmonary Toxicity: The decrease in glycogen levels following argemone oil intoxication could be due to enhanced glycogenolysis leading to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the glycoltic pathway resulting in accumulation of pyruvate in the blood of experimental animals and dropsy patients. The enhancement of glycogenolysis can further be supported by the interference of sanguinarine in the uptake of glucose through blocking of sodium pump via Na+-K+-ATPase and thereby inhibiting the active transport of glucose across intestinal barrier. It is well established that increased pyruvate concentration in blood uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and this may be responsible for thickening of interalveolar septa and disorganized alveolar spaces in lungs of argemone oil-fed rats and the breathlessness as has been observed in human victims. Cardiac Failure:The inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity of heart by sanguinarine is due to interaction with the cardiac glycoside receptor site of the enzyme,which may be responsible for producing degenerative changes in cardiac muscle fibers in the auricular wall of rats fed argemone oil and could be related to tachycardia and cardiac failure in Epidemic Dropsy patients. Delayed clearance:Destruction of hepatic cytochrome P450 significantly affects the metabolic clearance by liver. The retention of sanguinarine in the GI tract, liver, lung, kidney, heart, and serum even after 96 hrs of exposure indicates these as the likely target sites of argemone oil toxicity. Treatment. Withdrawal of the contaminated cooking oil is the most important initial step. Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein-rich diet are useful. Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E),and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used. Corticosteroids and antihistaminics such as promethazine have been advocated by some investigators,but demonstrated efficacy is lacking. Diuretics are used universally but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present, as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability. Cardiac failure is managed by bed rest, salt restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Pneumonia is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Renal failure may need dialysis therapy and complete clinical recovery is seen. Glaucoma may need operative intervention, but generally responds to medical management. Prevention. References "
wikipedia-2322224," Dermatillomania  Dermatillomania (also known as excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, neurotic excoriation, pathologic skin picking (PSP), compulsive skin picking (CSP) or psychogenic excoriation) is an impulse control disorder characterized by the repeated urge to pick at one's own skin, often to the extent that damage is caused. Research has suggested that the urge to pick is similar to an obsessive compulsive disorder but others have argued that for some the condition is more akin to substance abuse disorder. The two main strategies for treating this condition are pharmacological and behavioral intervention. Classification. Dermatillomania is defined as ""repetitive and compulsive picking of skin which results in tissue damage."" As of the release of the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in May 2013, dermatillomania is classified as its own separate condition under ""Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders"" and is termed ""excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.""  Similarities with other conditions. The inability to control the urge to pick is similar to the urge to compulsively pull one's own hair, i.e., trichotillomania. Researchers have noted the following similarities between trichotillomania and dermatillomania: the symptoms are ritualistic but there are no preceding obsessions; there are similar triggers for the compulsive actions; both conditions appear to play a role in modifying the arousal level of the subject; and the age on onset for both conditions is similar. There is also a high level of comorbidity between those that have trichotillomania and those that have dermatillomania. A notable difference between these conditions is that skin picking seems to be dominated by females whereas trichotillomania is more evenly distributed between the genders.  Research has also suggested that dermatillomania may be thought of as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Dermatillomania and OCD are similar in that they both involve ""repetitive engagement in behaviors with diminished control"" and also both generally decrease anxiety. Nevertheless, Odlaug and Grant have suggested that dermatillomania is more akin to substance abuse disorder than OCD. They argue that dermatillomania differs from OCD in the following fundamental ways: (1) there is a much greater share of females with dermatillomania; (2) dermatillomania may be inherently pleasurable whereas OCD is not; (3) the treatments that are generally effective for patients with OCD, (i. e., SSRIs and exposure therapy) are not as successful in patients with dermatillomania; and (4) unlike OCD, picking the skin is rarely driven by obsessive thoughts. Odlaug and Grant have recognized the following similarities between individuals with dermatillomania and patients with addictions: (1) a compulsion to engage in the negative behavior despite knowledge of the harm; (2) a lack of control over the problematic behavior; (3) a strong urge to engage in the behavior prior to engagement; and (4) a feeling of pleasure while engaging in the behavior or a feeling of relief or reduced anxiety after engaging in the behavior. One study that supported the addiction theory of picking found that 79% of patients with dermatillomania reported a pleasurable feeling when picking. Odlaug and Grant also argue that dermatillomania could have several different psychological causes, which would explain why some patients seem more likely to have symptoms of OCD, and others, of an addiction. They suggest that treating certain cases of dermatillomania as an addiction may yield more success than treating them as a form of OCD. Signs and symptoms. Episodes of skin picking are often preceded or accompanied by tension, anxiety, or stress. During these moments, there is commonly a compulsive urge to pick, bite, or scratch at a surface or region of the body, often at the location of a perceived skin defect.  The region most commonly picked is the face, but other frequent locations include the arms, legs, back, gums, lips, shoulders, scalp, stomach, chest, and extremities such as the fingernails, cuticles, and toenails. Most patients with dermatillomania report having a primary area of the body that they focus their picking on, but they will often move to other areas of the body to allow their primary picking area to heal. Individuals with dermatillomania vary in their picking behaviour; some do it briefly multiple times a day while others can do one picking session that can last for hours. The most common way to pick is to use the fingers although a significant minority of people use tools such as tweezers.  Skin picking often occurs as a result of some other triggering cause. Some common triggers are feeling irregularities on the skin and feeling anxious or other negative feelings. Complications arising from dermatillomania include: infection at the site of picking, tissue damage, and septicemia. Damage from picking can be so severe as to require skin grafting. Severe picking can cause epidural abscesses. Severe cases of dermatillomania can cause life-threatening injuries. For example, in one reported case a female picked a hole through the bridge of her nose, which required surgery to fix, and a 48-year old female picked through the skin on her neck exposing the carotid artery. Besides physical injuries, dermatillomania can cause severe physical scarring and disfigurement. Dermatillomania can cause feeling of intense guilt, shame, and embarrassment in individuals, and this greatly increases the risk of self-harm. Studies have shown that dermatillomania presented suicidal ideation in 12% of individuals with this condition, suicide attempts in 11.5% of individuals with this condition, and psychiatric hospitalizations in 15% of individuals with this condition. Causes. There have been many different theories regarding the causes of dermatillomania including biological and environmental factors.  A common hypothesis is that dermatillomania is often a coping mechanism to deal with elevated levels of arousal or stress within the individual, and that the individual has an impaired stress response. A review of behavioral studies found support in this hypothesis in that skin-picking appears to be maintained by automatic reinforcement within the individual. In contrast to neurological theories, there are some psychologists who believe that picking behavior is a result of repressed rage felt toward authoritarian parents. A similar theory holds that overbearing parents can cause the behavior to develop in their children.  Neurological. There is only a limited knowledge regarding the neurobiology that drives dermatillomania, and there have been no neuroimaging studies of patients with dermatillomania. Those individuals that have dermatillomania along with other diagnosed conditions report differing motivations for their picking. Those with both OCD and dermatillomania report that they will pick their skin due to a perceived contamination of the skin, while those with both body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and dermatillomania reportedly pick to fix perceived imperfections in the skin.  Studies have shown a linkage between dopamine and the urge to pick. Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine that are dopamine agonists, which increase the pharmacological effects of dopamine, have been shown to cause uncontrollable picking in users. These drugs can create the sensation of formication, which feels like something is crawling on or under the skin. Additionally, drugs such as naltrexone that are dopamine antagonists, which impede the pharmacological effects of dopamine, have shown some benefit in reducing picking behavior. Thus, dermatillomania could result from a dysfunction in the dopamine reward functions. There may be another neurological explanation for dermatillomania: individuals who have dermatillomania have less motor-inhibitory control, but show no sign of difference in cognitive flexibility, when compared to individuals without the condition. Motor-inhibitory control is a function of the right lateralized frontostriatal circuit, which includes the right inferior frontal and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices. The impairment of motor-inhibitory control is similar to the neurological conditions of those who have problems suppressing inappropriate behaviors, such as abusing methamphetamines. Diagnosis. Dermatillomania is not specifically defined in the fourth edition of the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" (DSM IV). The addition has been proposed for the fifth edition of the DSM as a condition where there is an intrusive compulsion to pick at one's skin that cannot be accounted for by another medical condition or mental disorder; where feelings of tension or anxiety precedes picking; where picking causes damage; and where the picking results in immediate pleasure or relief but later causes distress or impairment to the subject. Most of the published literature uses a simplified two-factor definition; i.e., dermatillomania is 1) repetitive picking at the skin that 2) results in significant distress or social or occupational impairment. There has been a debate as to whether to create a separate category in the DSM-V for dermatillomania. Two of the main reasons for objecting to the inclusion of dermatillomania in the DSM-V are: (1) that dermatillomania may just be a symptom of a different underlying disorder, e.g., OCD or BDD, and (2) that dermatillomania is merely a bad habit and that by allowing this disorder to obtain its own separate category it would force the DSM to include a wide array of bad habits as separate syndromes, e.g., nail biting and nose-picking. Stein has argued that dermatillomania does qualify as a separate syndrome and should be classified as its own category because: (1) dermatillomania occurs as the primary disorder and not as a subset of a larger disorder; (2) dermatillomania has well-defined clinical features; (3) there is gathering data on the clinical features and diagnostic criteria for this condition; (4) there is sufficient data to create this as a separate category for dermatillomania; (5) the incidence rate for dermatillomania is high within the population; (6) diagnostic criteria for the disease have already been proposed; (7) the classification of dermatillomania as a separate condition would lead to better studies and better treatment outcomes; and (8) classification as a separate condition would lead to more awareness of the disorder and encourage more people to obtain treatment.  Because dermatillomania is different from other conditions and disorders that cause picking of the skin, it is important that any diagnosis of dermatillomania take into account various other medical conditions as possible causes before diagnosing the patient with dermatillomania. There are a variety of conditions that cause itching and skin picking including: eczema, psoriasis, diabetes, liver disease, Hodgkin's disease, polycythemia vera, systemic lupus, and Prader-Willi syndrome. In order to better understand dermotillomania, researchers have developed a variety of scales to categorize skin-picking behavior. These include the Skin-Picking Impact Scale (SPIS), and The Milwaukee Inventory for the Dimensions of Adult Skin-picking. The SPIS was created to measure how skin picking affects the individual socially, behaviorally, and emotionally. As of the release of the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in May 2013, dermatillomania is classified as its own separate condition under ""Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders"" and is termed ""excoriation (skin-picking) disorder."" Treatment. Knowledge about effective treatments for dermatillomania is sparse despite the prevalence of the condition. There are two major classes of therapy for dermatillomania: pharmacological and behavioral.  Individuals with dermatillomania often do not seek treatment for their condition largely due to feelings of embarrassment or belief that the condition cannot be treated. One study found that only 45% of individuals with dermatillomania ever sought treatment and only 19% ever received dermalogical treatment. Another study found that only 30% of individuals with this disorder sought treatment. Pharmacological. There are several different classes of pharmacological treatment agents that have some support for treating dermatillomania: (1) SSRIs; (2) opioid antagonists; and (3) glutamatergic agents. In addition to these classes of drugs, some other pharmacological products have been tested in small trials as well.  SSRIs have shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD and this has provided an argument in favor of treating dermatillomania with the same therapy. Unfortunately, the clinical studies have not provided clear support for this, because there have not been large double-blind placebo-controlled trials of SSRI therapy for dermatillomania. Review of treatment with SSRIs of dermatillomania have shown that the following may be effective in reducing picking behavior: doxepin, clomipramine, naltrexone, pimozide, and olanzapine. Small studies of fluoxetine, an SSRI, in treating dermatillomania showed that the drug reduced certain aspects of skin picking, as compared to placebo, but full remission was not observed. One small study of patients with dermatillomania treated with citalopram, another SSRI, showed that those that took the drug significantly reduced their scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale compared to placebo, but that there was no significant decrease on the visual-analog scale of picking behavior. While there have been no human studies of opioid antagonists for the treatment of dermatillomania, there have been studies showing that these products can reduce self-chewing in dogs with acral lick, which some have proposed is a good animal model for dermatillomania. Furthermore, there have been case reports that support the use of these opioid antagonists to treat dermatillomania. Opioid antagonists work by affecting dopamine circuitry, thereby decreasing the pleasurable effects of picking. Another class of possible pharmacological treatments are glutamatergic agents such as n-acetyl cysteine (NAC). These products have shown some ability to reduce other problematic behaviors such as cocaine addiction and trichotillomania. Some case studies and some small studies of NAC have shown a decrease in dermatillomania by treatment with NAC, as compared to placebo. Topiramate, an anti-epileptic drug, has been used to treat dermatillomania; in a small study of individuals with Prader–Willi syndrome, it was found to reduce skin-picking behavior.  Behavioral. Behavioral treatments include habit reversal training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy Several studies have shown that habit reversal training associated with awareness training reduces skin-picking behavior in those individuals with dermatillomania that do not have psychological disabilities. Habit reversal training can include awareness enhancement and competing response training. For example, in one study the competing response training required participants to make a closed fist for one minute instead of picking or in response to condition that usually provokes picking behavior. Behavorial treatments in developmentally disabled. There are several different behavioral interventions that have been tested to treat dermatillomania in the developmentally disabled.  One treatment method is to have individuals wear a form of protective clothing that limits the ability of the patient to pick at his body, e.g., gloves or face mask.  Other behavioral treatments attempt to change behavior through providing different incentives. Under Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior (DRO), a patient is rewarded if able to abstain from the picking behavior for a certain amount of time. In contrast to DRO, Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior (DRI) rewards an individual for engaging in an alternative behavior that cannot physically occur at the same time as the problem behavior (e.g. sitting on your hands instead of picking at your skin). Lastly, differential reinforcement of alternative behavior rewards behavior that is not necessarily incompatible with the target behavior but serves the same function as the target behavior (e.g., providing people with a competing behavior to occupy their time instead of skin picking).  Another form of behavioral approach is to use punishment. This can either be verbal punishment, by telling the person no when they did the activity, or physical punishment, by making them do arm exercises, or spraying water at them when they engage in picking behavior. All of these techniques have been reported to have some success in small studies, but none has been tested in large enough population to provide definitive evidence of their effectiveness. Prognosis. Some individuals with dermatillomania find that the disorder interferes with daily life. Plagued by shame, embarrassment, and humiliation, they may take measures to hide their disorder by not leaving home, wearing long sleeves and pants in summer, or covering visible damage to skin with cosmetics and/or bandages. Activities such as typing may be painful for those who pick at their fingers or hands, or walking for those who pick at the soles of their feet. Epidemiology. The prevalence of dermatillomania is not well understood. Estimates of prevalence of the condition range from 1.4 to 5.4% in the general population. One U.S. telephone survey found that 16.6% of respondents ""picked their skin to the point of noticeable tissue damage"" and that 1.4% would qualify as meeting the requirements of dermatillomania. Another community survey found a rate of 5.4% had dermatillomania. A survey of college students found a rate of 4%. One study found that among non-disabled adults, 63% of individuals engaged in some form of skin picking and 5.4% engaged in serious skin picking. Lastly, a survey of dermatology patients found that 2% suffered from dermatillomania. In many patients dermatillomania begins with the onset of acne in adolescence, but the compulsion continues even after the acne has gone away. In those dermatillomania patients with acne, the grooming of the skin is disproportionate to the severity of the acne. Certain stressful events including marital conflicts, deaths of friends or family, and unwanted pregnancies have been linked to the onset of the condition. If dermatillomania does not occur during adolescence another common age of onset is between the ages of 30 to 45. Additionally, many cases of dermatillomania have been documented to begin in children under the age of 10. One small survey of patients with dermatillomania found that 47.5% of them had an early onset of dermatillomania that began before age 10.  Dermatillomania is more common in females than in males. Dermatillomania has a high rate of comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions, especially with mood and anxiety disorders . One survey of patients with dermatillomania found that 56.7% also had a DSM-IV Axis-I disorder and 38% had alcohol- or drug-abuse problems. Studies have shown the following rates of psychiatric conditions found in patients with dermatillomania: trichotillomania (38.3%), substance abuse (38%), major depressive disorder (approximately 31.7% to 58.1%), anxiety disorders (approximately 23% to 56%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (approximately 16.7% to 68%), and body dysmorphic disorder (approximately 26.8% to 44.9%). There are also higher rates of dermatillomania in patients in psychiatric facilities; a study of adolescent psychiatric inpatients found that dermatillomania was present in 11.8% of patients. It is also present at high rates with some other conditions: 44.9% of patients with body dysmorphic disorder also have dermatillomania; 8.9% of patients with OCD have dermatillomania; and 8.3% of patients with trichotillomania have dermatillomania.  Skin picking is also common in those with certain developmental disabilities; for example, Prader–Willi syndrome and Smith–Magenis syndrome. Studies have shown that 85% of people with Prader–Willi syndrome also engage in skin-picking. Children with developmental disabilities are also at an increased risk for dermatillomania.  Dermatillomania also correlates with ""social, occupational, and academic impairments, increased medical and mental health concerns (including anxiety, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder) ... and financial burden ... "" Dermatillomania also has a high degree of morbidity with occupational and marital difficulties. Substance abuse is often present, and individuals with dermatillomania are twice as likely to have first-degree relatives who have substance-abuse disorders (alcohol or drugs) than those without the condition. History. The first known mention of dermatillomania in the print can be found in 1898 by the French dermatologist Brocq, describing an adolescent female patient who had uncontrolled picking of acne. Dermatillomania in the media. Dermatillomania has been the subject of several episodes of Obsessed, a television documentary series that focuses on treatment of anxiety disorders. Dermatillomania is shown as a symptom of Nina Sayers' anxiety and OCD in the movie Black Swan. "
wikipedia-2322237," Snape Maltings  Snape Maltings is an arts complex on the banks of the River Alde at Snape, Suffolk, U.K.. It is best known for its concert hall, which is one of the main sites of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. The original purpose of the Maltings was the malting of barley for the brewing of beer; local barley, once malted, was sent from here to London and exported to mainland Europe. Today a collection of shops, galleries, restaurants and the Concert Hall fill the old buildings. The Alde Estuary is known for wildlife and river trips. History. Newson Garrett, a Victorian entrepreneur, built the Maltings in the 1800s; his name appears on plaques around the site. The river made Garrett decide to build a Maltings at this already busy port. Newson was ambitious and determined and in 1841 purchased the business of Osborne and Fennell, corn and coal merchants of Snape Bridge. From this port the Maltings began to evolve, using the River Alde to transport barley across Britain and into Europe on Thames barges. Within three years of his arrival, Newson Garrett was shipping 17,000 quarters of barley a year from Snape. Much of this barley would have been destined for breweries, where it had first to be malted. Newson saw an opportunity. Snape was in the heart of good agricultural land, and halfway between the brewing area of Norwich and London. Demand from the London breweries was growing fast, and it was becoming impractical to make malt and brew beer on the same premises. In 1854 he began malting at Snape, and was soon shipping malt, rather than barley to the breweries. The Maltings process at Snape came to an end in the 1960s as Swonnell and Son went into liquidation and seven acres of industrial buildings were left vacant. Thirty acres of land was offered for sale, including dwellings and an inn. It was difficult to imagine how such functional structures could be put to different use. However George Gooderham, a local farmer and businessman, recognised the potential. He purchased the site and set about finding alternative uses for the buildings. By the 1960s the Aldeburgh Music Festival was outgrowing the limited space available in the Jubilee Hall. Benjamin Britten started to look around for somewhere to build a concert hall. Britten had the vision to see the largest Malthouse, in its magnificent setting overlooking the saltings as a possible site. Negotiations began with George Gooderham and after little more than a year Snape Maltings Concert Hall was ready to be opened by the Queen at the start of the 1967 Aldeburgh Festival. Snape Maltings is a leading destination on the Suffolk Coast with the world famous Concert Hall and rehearsal space as well as independent shops, galleries, restaurants, art exhibitions and workshops. A calendar of events operate throughout the year from the June Festival and August Proms to guided river walks, boat trips, farmers markets and the Aldeburgh Food and Drink Festival. Benjamin Britten. The composer Benjamin Britten was inspired by the vast skies and moody seas of the Suffolk coast, and in 1948, along with singer Peter Pears and writer Eric Crozier, he founded the Aldeburgh Festival. Britten and Pears made a point of educating and supporting young artists. They brought together international stars and emerging talent, including world-renowned figures such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Yehudi Menuhin, Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich, and young stars in the making such as Elisabeth Söderström, Murray Perahia and Julian Bream. Venues. At first the Festival used local halls and churches but in 1967, Britten and Pears created a permanent home at Snape, 5 miles from Aldeburgh, by converting the Victorian maltings into an 832-seat venue. Within five years Britten and Pears had reclaimed more buildings on the site to establish a centre for talented young musicians. In 2006 Aldeburgh Music purchased a 999 year lease of the Snape Maltings Concert Hall, investing around £14 million in new studios and rehearsal spaces which came into use in 2009. The ""Creative Campus"" at Snape Maltings has four performance venues (from 70 to 830 capacity) and over 20 rehearsal and public spaces. Snape Maltings Concert Hall. Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Concert Hall Gallery, Oyster Bar and Restaurant Built by Newson Garrett in the mid-19th century, the 832-seat Concert Hall began life as a malthouse. Officially opened in 1967 by HM Queen Elizabeth II, the Hall suffered serious fire damage two years later, re-opening in time for the Aldeburgh Festival the following year. The conversion of the building was undertaken by Arup Associates, with the acoustics supervised by Derek Sugden. Hoffmann Building. Britten Studio, Jerwood Kiln Studio, rehearsal rooms. Opened in May 2009, the Hoffmann Building features two spaces suitable for performances as well as a number of additional rehearsal rooms, office space and a social area. The centrepiece of the building is the new Britten Studio, designed to have an excellent and flexible acoustic with a high level of sound insulation for recording. Ideal for orchestral rehearsals, it can also be used as a 340-seat venue. The Jerwood Kiln Studio, which seats up to 80 people in a flexible configuration, is an ideal space for smaller groups to rehearse, and is equipped for video and electro-acoustic installations. The Studio retains the double-height roof and much of the existing fabric of the original kiln structure. Britten–Pears Building. Peter Pears Recital Room, Holst Library, rehearsal rooms. A former barley store, the Britten–Pears Building was officially opened in 1979 by HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Holst Library. The Holst Library is connected to the Maltings. Many of the original contents were donated by Imogen Holst, who was a close friend of Benjamin Britten and an artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1956 to 1977, and it was named the Gustav Holst Library as a memorial to her father. According to her press release for the Aldeburgh Festival Office, ""the Gustav Holst Library will be a working library for the use of the students. It is being called after him in gratitude for his music and his teaching."" The library was officially opened by HM the Queen Mother and is open by appointment. It is situated in two rooms on the second floor of the BPP buildings in the Snape Maltings complex. The collection comprises books, scores and audio materials (LP, tape and CD) covering many genres. Much of the Library’s stock is available for searching on the web catalogue of the Britten-Pears Library. "
wikipedia-2322240," Tomb Raider III  Tomb Raider III - Adventures of Lara Croft is an action-adventure video game developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. It is the third instalment in the ""Tomb Raider"" series, and the sequel to ""Tomb Raider II"". The game was originally released for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in November 1998 and for the PlayStation Network in 2009 in America, with a release for the European PlayStation Network following in March 2011. The story follows Lara Croft as she embarks upon a quest to recover four pieces of a meteorite that are scattered across the world. The game has sold 6.5 million copies worldwide. Plot. Millions of years ago, a meteoroid strikes Antarctica, decimating a large area full of life on the then-near-tropical continent. In the present day, a corporation called RX Tech, under the guidance of Dr. Mark Willard, excavates the site, finding strange Rapa Nui-like statues and the grave of one of the Darwin's sailors. Within the game, while India must be visited first and Antarctica last, the three other locations: South Pacific Islands, London, and Nevada, can be visited in any order. When the game begins, Lara Croft is searching for the artefact in the ruins of an ancient Indian temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters a researcher working for RX Tech who appears to be insane. After parting ways, the researcher beats Lara to the Infada Stone, gaining supernatural powers. After killing him and taking the artefact, Lara is approached by Dr. Willard, the head of RX Tech, who explains the origins of the Infada Stone. Thousands of years ago, Polynesians came across the meteoroid crater and found that it had incredible power. Using rock from the meteoroid, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but, in the nineteenth century, a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and discovered the artefacts. The four stones were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help find the other three stones. On an island in the South Pacific, Lara fights cannibal tribesman, Velociraptors, a T-Rex and encounters a wounded soldier who tells her of a deity who lives in the hills of the island. Lara pursues the deity and learns from one of the tribesman that one of Darwin's sailors brought one of the artefacts to the island from Antarctica. She also learns about why the inhabitants fled their city there; the son of the leader was born without a face, caused by prolonged exposure to the Meteorite. Lara then infiltrates the deity's temple and the deity Puna, who has immense power granted by the meteor artefact called the Ora Dagger. In London, Lara searches for the Eye of Isis, now in the possession of Sophia Leigh, the head of a cosmetics corporation. Lara learns that the corporation has performed sick experiments on humans in order to achieve immortality and eternal youth for Sophia's personal gain. The deformed subjects of Sophia's failed experiments, presumed dead by the corporation, were dumped in the sewers, and assist Lara in exchange for a bottle of embalming fluid from the Natural History Museum. Sophia sends a number of assassins, under her employment, to kill Lara. However, they are all unsuccessful and Lara climbs through a ventilation shaft to Sophia's office where she is sitting with the artefact on her desk. Sophia mockingly offers Lara a job, telling her that with her lifestyle she would be the perfect face for her products, then Lara tells Sophia that her human subjects she experimented on are still alive. Lara demands she hand over the artefact which she refuses to do. Sophia takes the artefact and runs out the balcony to the other building and Lara who works her way up Sophia's building and across to the one she is on. Sophia attempts to kill her using the powers of the artefact, but Lara defeats her by shooting a fuse box connected to an electrical bridge that Sophia was standing on after the battle causing her to get electrocuted.  Arriving in Nevada and making her way through a desert canyon, Lara tries to enter Area 51, where Element 115, one of the four artefacts, is located in an alien spacecraft guarded by the government. But she faces a severe setback when she is taken as a prisoner in the base after her attempted break-in ends disastrously. Freeing herself and the other inmates, she escapes the security compound and stows away in a truck to Area 51. Angered, she meets and confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage rather than halt the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the Artefacts and the Meteorite they were carved from. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, stealing the artefacts and disappearing into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants (including insectile and reptilian things within the city itself) and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteor crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used the power of the four artefacts to activate the even greater power of the meteor: to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turning himself into a terrifying and all-powerful spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteor by taking the artefacts out of their positions that they were put in, kills the mutated Spider Willard and escapes by helicopter. Lara's mansion in England. ""Tomb Raider III"" features the largest tutorial level yet seen in a ""Tomb Raider"" game. The assault course from ""Tomb Raider II"" is drastically expanded to include exercise of Lara's new moves, target practice and a racetrack to hone the player's handling of the quad bike. Inside the mansion, a secret room can be discovered filled with artefacts and memorabilia from Lara's past adventures. It was the last game of the series to feature Lara's mansion until """". Gameplay. Features. The gameplay of ""Tomb Raider III"" picks up where ""Tomb Raider II"" left off (for a detailed examination of gameplay see the main article on ""Tomb Raider""). Once again, Lara's range of abilities has been expanded, now including such moves as the crouch stance, crawling, a sprinting move and the ability to ""monkey swing"" on overhead bars and vines. Sprinting allows Lara to gain a burst of greater speed while running. When activated by the player, a bar appears in the corner of the screen to indicate the amount of stamina Lara has left. Only sprinting depletes the bar (other activities such as climbing and jumping have no effect on it) and it quickly increases again by itself when Lara stops sprinting. When the bar is empty, she is forced back into her standard running speed. At any time during a sprint she can perform a forward roll, such as to dive under closing trapdoors. A portion of the game still takes place underwater, but this time new perils have been added. In some levels, such as Madubu Gorge, the current of the stream will pull Lara in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. She will eventually drown or be sucked into deadly rapids. These waters can only be navigated using a kayak. Additionally, some tropical pools are inhabited by a school of piranhas. Unlike alligators, these fish are invincible, and as soon as Lara enters their waters they will flock toward her, and kill her within seconds. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctic levels is too cold for Lara to swim through for more than a few seconds. She can only remain in the water for a short amount of time, and submerged under it for an even shorter amount of time. When she dives into it, a new status bar will appear in the corner of the screen to indicate her body temperature. If that bar reaches zero, Lara's life will rapidly decrease. Unlike the oxygen bar, this temperature bar will decrease if Lara is swimming on the surface as well as under it; so the only way she can cross these waters over a large distance without freezing to death is by using the motorboat. The temperature bar increases again by itself when Lara is out of the water, but it takes longer than the regular oxygen bar. Quicksand is a new surface introduced in this game. Although similar in appearance to regular soil, is distinguishable from it by its slow undulating movement. Should the player fall into it, Lara may wade very slowly but will sink deeper and deeper until she is completely submerged. Like being under water when submerged, the oxygen bar will deplete, and if this reaches zero the health bar will decrease and Lara will eventually drown. The player may climb out of quicksand if next to solid ground. In the Crash Site level of the South Pacific Islands section of the game, the swamp contains hidden stepping stones that Lara can use to cross safely. As always, the pistols are Lara's most basic form of defence. The shotgun, the harpoon gun, the Uzis and the grenade launcher have remained from ""Tomb Raider II"" (though the grenade launcher's grenades will now bounce around unless directly hitting a living target, unlike the instant explode-upon-impact style of Tomb Raider II). The small calibre semi-automatic pistols have been replaced by the powerful Desert Eagle. The M16 rifle has been changed to a similar MP5 sub-machine-gun. Also new to Lara's arsenal is the rocket launcher. On the PlayStation version, saving the game is restricted to the amount of Save Crystals the player has stored in Lara's inventory, something of a combination of the two different save systems featured in the two previous ""Tomb Raider"" games. These floating blue crystals can be found throughout each level, but unlike the original ""Tomb Raider"", they do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot. The PC version allows the player to save at any point. The developers planned on having the Save Crystal system for the PC version, but they simply weren't able to finish this feature before the end of the development cycle, so the crystals (which in the PC version are green instead of blue) act instead as instant use small medipacks in that version. The objective of the game remains unchanged, although ""Tomb Raider III"" arguably has fewer tombs to explore than the previous games. Instead, most levels take place in a more modern environment, and ""Tomb Raider"" introduces an element of stealth into the game play. For example in the Nevada adventure, it is sometimes preferable to sneak past guards instead of fighting them. Being spotted may set off alarms and close doors that are otherwise needed to complete the stage and therefore the player will have no other option than to take a more difficult route. Unlike its predecessors, after completing the India levels, the player can then choose which of the next three areas of the world they want to explore in any order they wish. Judith Gibbins reprises her role as Lara Croft from ""Tomb Raider II"". Characters. ""Tomb Raider III"" sees fictional archaeologist, Lara Croft, return as the game's main protagonist and only playable character. The game features several antagonists, notably Dr. Willard, who first hires Lara to retrieve four artefacts but reveals at the end of the game his more sinister motives. The South Pacific levels features Puna, an islander posing as a deity with the power of an artefact. In London, Lara is confronted by Sophia Leigh, a ruthless business woman who owns a cosmetic company which is experimenting on its employees in order to achieve the secret of immortality. She is in possession of one of the meteorite pieces. The game also marks the second appearance of Lara's butler, Winston, who appears in the Croft Manor training level as he did in ""Tomb Raider II"". ""Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact"". ""Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact"" is a mini-sequel to ""Tomb Raider III"", sometimes unofficially called ""Tomb Raider III Gold"". It was released exclusively for PC in 2000 and later on Mac OS in the ""Tomb Raider Trilogy"" by Aspyr. Unlike the expansion packs for the first two games, this was initially sold as a standalone product rather than as part of a re-release, and was not available for free download for existing owners. In ""The Lost Artefact"", Lara learns of the existence of a fifth meteorite piece called the Hand of Rathmore. She begins her investigations at the castle of Dr. Willard in the Scottish Highlands, progresses to exploring the Channel Tunnel in Dover and then ultimately ends up in the catacombs of Paris, where she is again confronted by Sophia Leigh. Reception. ""Tomb Raider III"" received generally positive reviews, with the PC version receiving an average score of 72.89% (indicating ""mixed"") and the PlayStation version received an average score of 78.01% (generally favourable) on Game Rankings. The game scored over 10 points lower than ""Tomb Raider II"", and nearly 20 lower than the first game. Despite this, it received some excellent reviews, Absolute PlayStation was highly positive, saying ""Unable to disappoint her fans, Lara returns for a third instalment that easily surpasses her prior adventures. The action adventure will once again send Lara spanning the globe from the deserts of Nevada to the islands of the South Pacific."" They awarded the game a 98/100 rating and added ""In gameplay terms Lara's latest adventures are by far the best... but don't expect an easy ride. Core have reached a fine balance between frustration and challenge that should suit most punters."" Total Games (today renamed Now Gamer) also praised the game, commenting ""Tomb Raider III may essentially be more of the same apart from a few new bells and whistles, but with gameplay as engrossing as this, perhaps that's no bad thing. It still walks all over young pretenders like ODT."" and rated the game a 9.2/10. Games Domain were more lukewarm however, offering the game a rating of 70/100. Whilst praising certain aspects of the gameplay, they felt ""Although the gameplay is as involving as it ever was, the lack of innovation means that you feel you're playing an expansion pack for 'Tomb Raider 2' than a completely new version."" IGN were mostly positive, awarding the game an 8/10, however, just like many critics, they felt the game had failed to change the same tried and tested formula. They said ""The sad thing is that Tomb Raider III solves none of its original dilemmas, and as it stands now, the exploration-adventure genre -- one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider -- is in the exact spot it was two years ago."" GameSpot echoed something similar, remarking """"Tomb Raider III"" is much like the first two games in the line, which is to say that there's nothing new thematically, although there are a few improvements to this edition."" After describing some of the improvements, GameSpot rounded off a mainly positive review by saying ""At the end of the day though (and putting all the hype, creepy marketing campaigns, and strange celebrity worship surrounding the series aside), there's no denying that Tomb Raider III is a solid game, worth the time of anyone who enjoys a good puzzle/adventure title. Those who lost interest in the series with Tomb Raider II may want to give it another look with the third."" The game was a bestseller in the UK. "
wikipedia-2322259," Environmental issues in Japan  Environmental pollution in Japan has accompanied industrialization since the Meiji period. One of the earliest cases was the copper poisoning caused by drainage from the Ashio Copper Mine in Tochigi prefecture, beginning as early as 1878. Repeated floods occurred in the Watarase River basin, and 1,600 hectares of farmland and towns and villages in Tochigi and Gunma prefectures were damaged by the floodwater, which contained excessive inorganic copper compounds from the Ashio mine. The local farmers led by Shozo Tanaka, a member of the Lower House from Tochigi appealed to the prefecture and the government to call a halt to the mining operations. Although the mining company paid compensatory money and the government engaged in the embankment works of the Watarase river, no fundamental solution of the problem was achieved. Japan is the world's leading importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels. Environment deterioration in the 1960s. Current Japanese environmental policy and regulations were the consequence of a number of environmental disasters in 1950s and 1960s. Cadmium poisoning from industrial waste in Toyama Prefecture was discovered to be the cause of the extremely painful . People in Minamata City in Kumamoto Prefecture were poisoned by methylmercury drained from the chemical factory, known as the ""Minamata disease"". The number of casualties in Minamata is 6,500 as of November 2006.  In Yokkaichi, a port in Mie Prefecture, air pollution caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions led to a rapid increase in the number of people suffering from asthma and bronchitis. In urban areas photochemical smog from automotive and industrial exhaust fumes also contributed to a rise in respiratory problems. In the early 1970s, chronic arsenic poisoning attributed to dust from arsenic mines occurred in Shimane and Miyazaki prefectures. Consumers Union of Japan was founded in 1969 to deal with health problems and false claims by companies, as Japan's rampant industrial development was seen as causing problems for consumers and citizens. In the 1970s, Consumers Union of Japan led the opposition to nuclear power, calling for a nation-wide Anti-Nuclear Power Week Campaign. Today In the 1990s, Japan's environmental legislation was further tightened. In 1993 the government reorganized the environment law system and legislated the ""Basic Environment Law"" (環境基本法) and related laws. The law includes restriction of industrial emissions, restriction of products, restriction of wastes, improvement of energy conservation, promotion of recycling, restriction of land utilization, arrangement of environmental pollution control programs, relief of victims and provision for sanctions. The Environment Agency was promoted to full-fledged Ministry of the Environment in 2001, to deal with the deteriorating international environmental problems. In a 1984 the Environmental Agency had issued its first white paper. In the 1989 study, citizens thought environmental problems had improved compared with the past, nearly 1.7% thought things had improved, 31% thought that they had stayed the same, and nearly 21% thought that they had worsened. Some 75% of those surveyed expressed concern about endangered species, shrinkage of rain forests, expansion of deserts, destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, and increased water and air pollution in developing countries. Most believed that Japan, alone or in cooperation with other industrialized countries, had the responsibility to solve environmental problems. In the 2007 opinion poll, 31.8% of the people answered environmental conservation activity leads to more economic development, 22.0% answered the environmental activity does not always obstruct the economic, 23.3% answered environmental conservation should be given preference even if it may obstruct the economic and 3.2％ answered economic development should place priority than environmental conservation. The OECD's first Environmental Performance Review of Japan was published in 1994, which applauded the nation for decoupling its economic development from air pollution, as the nation's air quality improved while the economy thrived. However, it received poorer marks for water quality, as its rivers, lakes and coastal waters did not meet quality standards. Another report in 2002 said that the mix of instruments used to implement environmental policy is highly effective and regulations are strict, well enforced and based on strong monitoring capacities. In the 2006 environment annual report, the Ministry of Environment reported that current major issues are global warming and preservation of the ozone layer, conservation of the atmospheric environment, water and soil, waste management and recycling, measures for chemical substances, conservation of the natural environment and the participation in the international cooperation. Current Issues. Waste management. Japan as of now has taken a much more proactive approach to waste management. In particular, Japanese city and prefectural authorities have focused on the reduction of solid waste going into landfills. This of course is in response to the lack of affordable space available for landfill sites. Their approach relies heavily on four major factors: 1) technological advancements in incineration, 2) technological advancements in plastics recycling, 3) Comprehensive production-side recycle stream package labelling, and 4) wide consumer-side/household participation in recycling and waste material separation (""bunbetsu""). Global warming. As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions level by 6% less than the level in 1990, and to take other steps related to curbing climate change. Japan is the world’s fifth biggest emission emitter The Cool Biz campaign introduced under former Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning use in government offices. Nuclear power. Japan maintains one third of its electric production from nuclear power plants. While a majority of Japanese citizens generally supported the use of existing nuclear reactors, since the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Dai Ichi power plant on March 11, 2011, this support seems to have shifted to a majority wanting Japan to phase out nuclear power. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan was the first leading politician to openly voice his opposition to Japan's dependence upon nuclear energy and suggested a fazing out of nuclear energy sources towards other sources of renewable energy.(http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/japan-nuclear-debate-idUSL3E7F70K320110408) Objections against the plan to construct further plants has grown as well since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami which triggered the nuclear melt down of three reactors at the Fukushima dai ichi plant in Eastern Japan. {http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/japan-pm-naoto-kan-vows-nuclear-free-future/story-fn3dxity-1226109855727}  The treatment of radioactive wastes also became a subject of discussion in Japan. New spent-nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant was constructed in Rokkasho in 2008, the site of the underground nuclear-waste repository for the HLW and LLW has not yet been decided. Some local cities announced a plan to conduct an environmental study at the disposal site, but citizens' groups oppose strongly against the plan. Fishery and whaling. In the Japanese diets, fish and its products are more prominent than other types of meat. Because of the depletion of ocean stocks in the late 20th century, Japan's total annual fish catch has been diminishing rapidly. Japan, along with the United States and the European Union, occupies the large part of international fish trade. Japanese fish catches were the third in the world in 2000, following China and Peru. The United States, Chile, Indonesia, the Russian Federation and India were other major countries. By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean. Japan has a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore. Whaling for research purposes continued even after the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This whaling program has been criticized by environmental protection groups and anti-whaling countries, who say that the program is not for scientific research. Urban planning. The massive nationwide rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of World War II, and the development of the following decades, led to even further urbanization and construction. The construction industry in Japan is one of its largest, and while Japan maintains a great many parks and other natural spaces, even in the hearts of its cities, there are few major restrictions on where and how construction can be undertaken. Alex Kerr, in his books ""Lost Japan"" and ""Dogs & Demons"", is one of a number of authors who focuses heavily on the environmental problems related to Japan's construction industry, and the industry's lobbying power preventing the introduction of stricter zoning laws and other environmental protection efforts.

wikipedia-2322392," Dynamic verb  A dynamic or fientive verb is a verb that shows continued or progressive action on the part of the subject. This is the opposite of a stative verb. Dynamic verbs have duration. They occur over time. This time may or may not have a defined endpoint, and may or may not yet have occurred. These distinctions lead to various forms related to tense and aspect. For example, a dynamic verb may be said to have a durative aspect if there is not a defined endpoint, or a punctual aspect if there is a defined endpoint. Examples of dynamic verbs are 'to run', 'to hit', 'to intervene', 'to savour' and 'to go'. An outstanding feature of modern English is its limited use of the simple present tense of dynamic verbs. Generally, the progressive tense is required to express an action taking place in the present (I am going). The simple present usually refers to a habitual action (I go every day), a general rule (water runs downhill), a future action in some subordinate clauses (if I go) or the historical present (President signs bill). A dynamic verb expresses a wide range of actions that may be physical (to run), mental (to ponder), or perceptual (to see), as opposed to a stative verb, which purely expresses a state in which there is no obvious action (to know, believe, suppose etc.).

wikipedia-2322403," Jack Delano  Jack Delano (August 1, 1914 – August 12, 1997) was an American photographer for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and a composer noted for his use of Puerto Rican folk material. Biography. Delano was born as Jacob Ovcharov (Cyrillic: Яков Овчаров) in Voroshilovka village, Podolie Governorate, near Vinnytsia, Russian Empire and moved, with his parents and younger brother, to the United States in 1923. Between 1924 and 1932 he studied graphic arts/photography and music (viola and composition) at the Settlement Music School and solfeggio with a professor from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After being awarded an art scholarship for his talents, he attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) where, from 1928 until 1932, he studied illustration and continued his musical training. While there, Delano was awarded the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, on which he chose to travel to Europe, where he bought a camera that got him interested in photography. After graduating from the PAFA, Delano proposed a photographic project to the Federal Art Project: a study of mining conditions in the Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania anthracite coal area. Delano sent sample pictures to Roy Stryker and applied for a job at the Farm Security Administration Photography program FSA. Through the help of Edwin Rosskam and Marion Post Wolcott, Stryker offered Delano a job at $2,300/year. As a condition of the job, Delano had to have his own car and driver's license, both of which he acquired before moving to Washington, D.C.  Before working at the FSA, Delano had done his own processing and developing but did neither at the FSA. Other photographers working for the FSA include Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Gordon Parks. In 1943 FSA was eliminated as ""budget waste"" and subsumed into the Office of War Information (OWI).  He travelled to Puerto Rico in 1941 as a part of the FSA project. This trip had such a profound influence on him that he settled there permanently in 1946. With his wife Irene (a second cousin to fellow photographer Ben Shahn) he worked in the Community Division of the Department of Public Education producing films, for many of which Delano composed the score. Delano also directed ""Los Peloteros"", a Puerto Rican film about poor rural kids and their love for baseball. The film remains a classic in Puerto Rican cinema. Jack Delano's musical compositions included works of every type: orchestral (many composed for the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra), ballets (composed for Ballet Infantil de Gilda Navarra and Ballets de San Juan), chamber, choral (including ""Pétalo de rosa"", a commission for Coro de Niños de San Juan) and solo vocal. His vocal music often showcases Puerto Rican poetry, especially the words of friend and collaborator Tomás Blanco. Blanco, Délano and his wife Irene collaborated on children's books. The most prominent of these remains a classic in Puerto Rican literature: """" by Tomás Blanco, with illustrations by Irene Delano and incidental music (written on the margins) by Jack Delano.  His score for the film ""Desde las nubes"" demonstrates an early use of electronic techniques. Most of his works composed after he moved to Puerto Rico are notable for using folk material in a classical form. "
wikipedia-2322412," Ninkasi  Ninkasi is the ancient Sumerian tutelary goddess of beer. Her father was Enki, the lord Nudimmud, and her mother was Ninti, the queen of the Abzu. She is also one of the eight children created in order to heal one of the eight wounds that Enki receives. Furthermore, she is the goddess of alcohol. She was also borne of ""sparkling fresh water."" She is the goddess made to ""satisfy the desire"" and ""sate the heart."" She would prepare the beverage daily. In ancient Mesopotamia the brewer's craft was the only profession which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specificially: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer. Hymn to Ninkasi. The Sumerian written language and the associated clay tablets are among the earliest human writings. Scholarly works from the early 1800s onward have developed some facility translating the various Sumerian documents. Among these is a poem with the English title, “A hymn to Ninkasi”. The poem is, in effect, a recipe for brewing beer. A translation from the University of Oxford describes combining bread, a source for yeast, with malted and soaked grains and keeping the liquid in a fermentation vessel until finally filtering it into a collecting vessel. Modern Uses. Ninkasi Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon takes it name from the goddess Ninkasi. "
wikipedia-2322417," Golden Balls  Golden Balls is a British daytime game show presented by Jasper Carrott. It aired on the ITV network from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. From 25 February 2008 to 13 February 2009, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming) (STV Bingo in Scotland);, from 2 November to 18 December 2009, the show was sponsored by Carpet Right and from January 2013 to February 2013, whilst repeated on Challenge, the show was sponsored by Sky Bingo. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise. Gameplay. Round 1. At the back of the studio is the ""Golden Bank"", a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside it, are 100 golden balls, containing cash values, ranging from £10 to £75,000 (in the unaired pilot, the highest valued ball was £200,000 and £100,000 was also present). Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and four ""Killer"" balls are added by Amanda Grant, the ""Balls' Assistant"". These sixteen balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants. Each contestant places two balls on his front row and two on his back row. The balls on the front row are visible to all contestants; the balls on the back row are visible only to their owner. Each contestant in turn announces the contents of the balls on his back row. The contestant can either tell the truth or lie about the balls. After each contestant has done this, the contestants discuss who they think is lying, and try to establish who has the worst set of balls, either in terms of having the lowest amount of money or the most Killer balls. The contestants then secretly vote for which of them they would like to leave the game. In the case of a tie, the contestants must try to reach a consensus in open discussion. If this does not occur, who is eliminated is decided at random. This is decided by giving each contestant involved in the tie another golden ball, one being a Killer ball and the others empty. The contestant who had the Killer ball is eliminated. At the end of the round, the contestants reveal the contents of the balls on their back rows and the eliminated contestant's balls are ""binned"", namely they are out of the game forever. Round 2. The three remaining contestants' balls are put back into the ball machine, along with two more cash balls chosen at random from the Golden Bank and one more Killer ball, making fifteen balls in play. These fifteen balls are split among the remaining three contestants randomly and equally, with two balls on their front rows and three on their back rows. As with Round 1, the contestants reveal the contents of the balls on their front rows and announce what is in the balls on their back rows, and may lie. The contestants then discuss the veracity of each other's claims, and vote a player off in the same fashion as in Round 1. Bin or Win? The two remaining contestants' balls are again put back into the ball machine and one more Killer ball is added, making eleven balls in play. The two contestants sit at a desk with the eleven balls between them. In turn, starting with the contestant who brought the most money into the final, the contestants pick a ball to ""bin"" (eliminate from the game) and pick a ball to ""win"" (add to the jackpot). If a Killer ball is picked to be won, then the cumulative value of the jackpot is divided by 10. This process is repeated five times. Split or Steal? After five balls have been won, the contestants make one last decision to determine the final jackpot division. Each contestant chooses one of two final golden balls, one with ""Split"" printed on the cash background inside it, and one with ""Steal"" printed on the killer background inside it. The players have a chance to speak with each other face to face before making their choices. The table below shows how much of the jackpot is gained by each contestant with the different combinations of choices: This is similar to the prisoner's dilemma, a well-studied problem in game theory. A key difference is that, in the standard Prisoner's Dilemma payoffs, if the one player defects (or steals), the other player is better off defecting than cooperating (splitting), but in Golden Balls, if the one player steals, the other player gets the same amount (nothing) either way. The catch is that all three results in the matrix where at least one person steals are Nash equilibria, and stealing is a weakly dominant strategy; this means that, as long as someone is planning on stealing, neither player has anything to gain by changing what they're doing, but if both players are planning on splitting, the players have an incentive to steal for a better payoff, and so both players splitting is an unstable strategy. The ""Split or Steal?"" game element was also used on Shafted, a previous Endemol production, and in the U.S. Game Show Network game Friend or Foe? Ball amounts. Here is a list of all main ball amounts which appeared throughout all series of Golden Balls: £10, £20, £25, £30, £40, £50, £60, £70, £75, £80, £90, £100, £125, £150, £175, £200, £250, £300, £350, £400, £450, £500, £550, £600, £650, £700, £750, £800, £850, £900, £950, £1,000, £1,100, £1,200, £1,250, £1,300, £1,400, £1,500, £1,600, £1,700, £1,750, £1,800, £1,900, £2,000, £2,500, £3,000, £3,500, £4,000, £4,500, £5,000, £5,500, £6,000, £6,500, £7,000, £7,500, £8,000, £8,500, £9,000, £9,500, £10,000, £11,000, £12,000, £13,000, £14,000, £15,000, £16,000, £17,000, £18,000, £19,000, £20,000, £24,000, £25,000,£30,000, £35,000, £40,000, £45,000, £50,000, £55,000, £60,000, £65,000, £70,000, £75,000. There were 'duplicate balls' throughout every series, meaning, for example, one could open two balls containing the same amount of money. There were also, on two occasions, an amount repeated thrice in the same game. On these occasions, contestants opened their balls to reveal three £6,000 and three £10,000 balls collectively. This only occurred twice during the entire run of two hundred and eighty-eight episodes. Near the end of its run, new, large amounts were added, in a bid to make the game more exciting. These amounts were more obscure than the 'going up in increments of £5,000' the old ball amounts system used to follow above the £20,000 ball. Some examples of these balls seen during the later series of the show are £42,000, £67,000 and £72,000. Popularity. The first show opened with 1.6 million viewers. Viewership climbed to a steady 2 million viewers. In the same 17:00 timeslot, eight of the first eleven episodes beat Channel 4's Richard & Judy, and The Weakest Link on BBC Two also took a dent from the show's success. Series 2 went on to average 2.1 million viewers in early 2008. As of summer 2009, the show's popularity fell; it attracted only around 1.2 million viewers, which led to the show's termination on 18 December 2009. It was still regularly shown weekdays at 3pm and also on weekend mornings on Challenge in the UK, but these repeats stopped the first week of July 2013. It is now also showing on ITV again but usually after midnight. Scientific research. Golden Balls has attracted attention from social scientists as a natural experiment on cooperation. A team of economists including Richard Thaler have analyzed the decisions of the final contestants and found, among others, the following (http://ssrn.com/abstract=1592456): Criticism. British psychologist Adrian Raine has criticised the show, arguing that it ""encourages deceitfulness"", and that many of its contestants are celebrated for displaying ""characteristics of psychopathy"". Viewer's competition. For series 3, a viewer's game was introduced. Four golden balls appear on the screen at the first two commercial breaks. One contains £3,000, the other three are Killer balls. They are shuffled and the viewer has to find the cash ball. From series 4 until the end of its run, there were multiple formats for the viewer's competition, including the one used in series 3. In addition, the prize per day ranged from £2,000 to £4,000. Video Game. The Video Game has been released on the Nintendo DS and Wii platforms. The Mobile Game. In 2007, Gameloft released ""Golden Balls, The Mobile Game"". The DVD Game. An interactive DVD game has been released. The Board Game and Card Game. A board game has been released.

wikipedia-2322506," Fantastic Planet  Fantastic Planet (, lit. ""The Wild Planet"") is a 1973 cutout stop motion science fiction allegorical film directed by René Laloux, production designed by Roland Topor, written by both of them and animated at Jiří Trnka Studio. The film was an international production between France and Czechoslovakia and was distributed in the United States by Roger Corman. It won the special jury prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. The story is based on the novel ""Oms en série"", by the French writer Stefan Wul. A working title for the film while it was in development was ""Sur la planète Ygam"" (""On the Planet Ygam""). The film had a total of 809,945 admissions in France. Plot. The film depicts a future in which human beings, known as ""Oms"" (a homonym of the French-language word hommes, meaning men), are creatures on the Traags' home planet. The Traags are an alien species which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans and they live much longer than human beings. Although some Oms are domesticated as pets, they are seen as pests and are periodically exterminated. A group of Traag children accidentally kill an Om woman during play. Unfortunately her death leaves an orphaned infant, who is taken in by an adult Traag as a pet for his child, Tiva. Tiva’s father just happens to be master Sinh, the Traag great Aedile and after some time, when the child and pet are playing, they surprise him and several of his compatriots during a ritual melding session. It is revealed that many Traag children have Oms like Tiva's. The bond created between the Traag child, Tiva, and the Om, named Terr (word play on the French word Terre, meaning Earth) deepens as time passes by. Tiva's education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user. Because she enjoys having Terr in her hand when she is having her ""infos,"" Terr begins to acquire the Traag knowledge. Terr begins to realize who and what he is, and escapes, taking the headset with him. He eventually finds other Oms and after some tribulation, is accepted into a tribe. Over the next several scenes, it is shown how the Oms have adapted to life on the Traags' planet. One day, the now-literate Oms reads a new sign on one of the walls, and learns the park is about to be ""de-Omized."" The de-Omizing is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas. A great many Oms perish from this gas, but a sizable number still manage to escape. The Oms retaliate and manage to kill one of their Traag attackers. The death of the Traag puts the Council in an uproar. De-Omizing is stepped up to a much higher priority, new technologies are developed, and extermination frequency greatly increases. Fatalities resulting from Traag attempts to de-Omize are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters, but the Traags' updated technologies become ever more aggressive, and when an automated scout detects the persistent Om settlement, it summons an array of lethal devices. The Oms launch manned rockets toward the Fantastic Planet, where they discover headless humanoid statues. As Traag meditation bubbles descend to alight atop the statues, the statues begin to dance. This is the secret that animates the statues and allows the Traags to reproduce. When the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets, the Oms use disintegration weapons to shatter the statues, which in turn makes thousands of meditative Traag to go insane. Pandemonium reigns in the Council chamber, for it seems the two species will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together. While the Traag council continues to think of revenge, it is proposed that the two species finally create peace between each other. The last scene proves that peace has been made as an Om steps down off an outstretched Traag hand, removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and self-assertion. Themes. The film is chiefly noted for its surreal imagery, the work of French writer and artist Roland Topor. The landscape of the Traag planet is full of strange creatures, including a cackling predator which traps small fluttering animals in its cage-like nose, shakes them to death and hurls them to the ground. The Traag practice of meditation, whereby they commune psychically with each other and with different species, is shown in transformations of their shape and colour. The interaction of science and superstition is most apparent in the Wizard, who resists the knowledge that Terr brings, fearing it will erode the power he maintains. Knowledge trumps ignorance, but in this case only after surviving an attempted assassination. Terr's drive to share knowledge overpowers the fear of an unknown people. Only his courage to save others not of his adopted tribe allows that tribe to overcome the loss of their leader. The Traags and Oms finally learn to live in peace and mutual benefit; presumably any groups can if they and their leaders really want to. This may have been a theme favoured by the filmmakers as it was made and released during the Cold War (the source novel was first published in 1957). Soundtrack. The music was composed by Alain Goraguer. Televised airings. RTV (Retro Television Network) ran ""Fantastic Planet"" on January 2, 2011, as part of its ""Offbeat Cinema"" presentation originally aired in Buffalo, NY by WKBW-TV, channel 7. ""Fantastic Planet"" appeared at least once in the 1980s on USA Network's Night Flight weekend program. In the United Kingdom and Ireland it has been shown on the Sky Arts channel and has been available on demand via the Sky Anytime service. References in other works. Madlib cites the film as an influence, using visuals from the film on his album covers and samples of the soundtrack on his songs. The song ""Come On Feet"", on his album ""The Unseen"", contains many samples from the movie, including the recurring melody of the main theme.

wikipedia-2322546," PlayStation Portable homebrew  PlayStation Portable homebrew refers to the process of using exploits and hacks to execute unsigned code on the PlayStation Portable (PSP). History of homebrew. Soon after the PSP was released, hackers began to discover exploits in the PSP that could be used to run unsigned code on the device. Sony released version 1.51 of the PSP firmware in May 2005 to plug the holes that hackers were using to gain access to the device. On 15 June 2005 the hackers distributed the cracked code of the PSP on the internet. Hackers refused to apply updates which would render their hacks unusable so Sony attempted to convince users that there was a benefit to upgrading by including new features in the firmware updates, such as a web browser, and not just security patches to plug the vulnerabilities. BusinessWeek dubbed this the ""carrot-and-stick"" approach. In August 2005 Sony released version 2.0 of the firmware which included the web browser, file compatibility updates and other features. Hackers and other homebrew enthusiasts then encountered the first trojan for the PSP. Symantec called this trojan ""Trojan.PSPBrick"". Users attempting to downgrade their PSP using this software instead found that it was rendered inoperable as this software deleted mandatory/important system files. Over the course of 2005 Sony released six different versions of the firmware and hackers typically responded to it by downgrading to avoid the new security updates. In Mid-2006, after several months of problems in defeating the PSP's firmware a file was posted online which allowed new PSPs running firmware version 2.6 to downgrade to 1.5 so they could then be hacked using older methods. This reportedly caused more buzz in the community than any recent official offerings for the device. Dark_AleX. Dark AleX (aka Dark_AleX, Dax) is a Spanish programmer who writes homebrew applications for the PlayStation Portable. Dark AleX, as well as other variations of the name, is a pseudonym under which he works. One of the drawbacks of downgrading the PSP is that new official media may require the presence of a new firmware edition. Dark_Alex had released a custom firmware called ""Dark Alex's Open Edition firmware"" or ""Custom Firmware (CFW)"" which opens the firmware but allows users to use the existing feature set of the current edition. Sony quickly patched the firmware again, continuing the cat-and-mouse game with the hackers and users. In 2006 Sony released six updates to the system firmware and in 2007 they released another six updates. In July 2007 Dark_AleX officially stopped his work on the PSP, citing perceived problems with Sony as one of the reasons for his departure. Some people even suggested that Dark_AleX was paid by Sony not to release any more custom firmware, but Sony denied this. Custom Firmware allows the running of unsigned code such as homebrew applications and UMD backups, emulators for other consoles, as well as PlayStation games when the disc images are converted into PSP format. Half Byte Loader. Half Byte Loader (also known as HBL) is an open source software project that aims at loading homebrew for PlayStation Portable handheld console through user-mode exploits. It does not provide any mechanism for loading official games or ISO images. HBL was built from scratch to be easily portable to any user-mode exploit. The project was created and started by m0skit0 and ab5000. HBL was created initially for the Medal of Honor Heroes exploit. An alpha version was released as open source by m0skit0 and ab5000 on November 2009, which ran very simple homebrews. When the Patapon 2 demo exploit was found and leaked, wololo joined the project and proposed to port HBL to this new exploit. The AdvancedPSP forums, which hosted the project, were shut down by the hosting and the project moved to wololo/talk forums. wololo also created a new public SVN repository for HBL at Google Code. Other PSP hackers such as Davee and neur0n joined in to help the development of this port. HBL for Patapon 2 passed to beta version, and can be considered the first useful HBL version, released on March 2010. HBL was subsequently ported to several other user-mode exploits, and also served as base for other projects, like the PRO CFW project. HBL was also ported to run on Sony PlayStation Vita's PSP emulator with very little modifications. This project was named Vita HBL (VHBL) and was uploaded to HBL's public repository by wololo on March 2012. Motivation for homebrew. Hackers have stated that the motivation for unlocking the PSP has nothing to do with piracy, but allowing individuals full access to the products they've purchased and the freedom to do what they want with the item as well as the interest in exploring something unknown. Fanjita, a member of the hacker group ""N00bz!"", stated,  ""Everyone has the right to do what they want with their own hardware. Piracy does upset me, and because what we are doing opens the way to piracy it's harder to justify it morally. But our stance on piracy is clear, and we hope to be role models. Sony have never been in touch with me, so I am confident that what we are doing is legal."""" Sony's position. Sony has told the media that any issues resulting from running modified code on the device would void the warranty. They have also stated that the problem is not with homebrew but piracy. However their constant firmware updates are seen as attempts to hamper homebrew development. According to Phillip Torrone from Make Magazine, this hampering could be due to the attempts to curb piracy and may cause more harm than good. ""I think the really smart companies should release their products to the alpha geeks for six months and let the alpha geeks play around with them. It seems to me they'd save a lot of money on R&D, and they'd come out with much more solid products."" However, Sony has also said that, when questioned about homebrew game support, Jack Tretton replied with, "
wikipedia-2322556," Solitude/Solitaire  Solitude/Solitaire, released on 23 June 1986, is the second solo release by former-Chicago member and lead vocalist Peter Cetera, his first album after leaving the band. It includes the hits ""Glory of Love"" and ""The Next Time I Fall"" (with Amy Grant). Both reached the No. 1 position on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart. Produced by Michael Omartian (who later produced ""Another Perfect World"" in 2001) the album was Cetera's greatest solo success. Commonly mistaken for his first solo album, which was really the self-titled ""Peter Cetera"", Cetera recorded this album after leaving Chicago in 1985. Being a prominent songwriter for the band, many of the songs present of ""Solitude/Solitaire"" are rumored to originally have been slated for ""Chicago 18"", especially ""Big Mistake"" and ""Daddy's Girl"". While ""Big Mistake"" was due to be the first single from the album, ""Glory of Love"", co-written by Cetera and producer David Foster was released instead. That song, from the movie ""The Karate Kid, Part II"", topped the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts, and helped make ""Solitude/Solitaire"" a hit album (eventually going platinum). The follow-up single, ""The Next Time I Fall"", was also a major success and topped the charts. Later singles released from the album included ""Big Mistake"" and ""Only Love Knows Why"". ""Solitude/Solitaire"", a slickly recorded and produced album, marked a high point in Cetera's career, where he achieved success for the first time on his own, selling more copies than ""Chicago 18"", Chicago's first album without Cetera. As time progressed, he became less appealing to the general public and more appealing to the adult contemporary audiences, and consequently, this was his highest selling solo album. Track listing. ""Solitude/Solitare"" peaked at No. 26 on the ""Billboard"" Pop Albums chart. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the US. "
wikipedia-2322579," Coronal plane  A coronal plane (also known as the frontal plane) is any vertical plane that divides the body into ventral and dorsal (belly and back) sections. It is one of the planes of the body used to describe the location of body parts in relation to each other. Examples.

wikipedia-2322608," Toshiaki Kawada  His matches against Mitsuharu Misawa, Jun Akiyama, and Kenta Kobashi in the 1990s are argued by many fans and experts in the industry as some of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time. He is widely known for his extremely stiff wrestling style, and has the distinction of having competed in 19 matches that were given a 5-Star Rating by Wrestling Observer Newsletter writer Dave Meltzer; he is third behind long-time rivals Kobashi (23) and Misawa (24). Professional wrestling career. All Japan Pro Wrestling (1982–2005). Early years (1982–1987). Kawada was very active during his high school years in amateur wrestling, becoming a national champion in his senior year after defeating Keiichi Yamada (who later became Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger in professional wrestling) in the finals. He made his professional wrestling debut at the age of 18 on October 4, 1982 for All Japan Pro Wrestling, competing against (future partner) Hiromichi Fuyuki. Kawada was then sent to North America for a year in November 1985, where he gained experience as a pro wrestler in Fred Behrend's Texas All-Star Wrestling (San Antonio, Texas), Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling (in Calgary) and Frank Valois' International Wrestling (in Montreal); Kawada was billed as ""Kio Kawada from Seoul, South Korea"" in Stampede Wrestling for a very short time around June 1986. He was under adverse circumstances, and rarely has he talked about his days in American/Canadian wrestling. Rise to Superstardom (1987–1995). His first major break came in 1987 when he joined his mentor Genichiro Tenryu's ""Revolution"" group. Kawada often teamed with Fuyuki under the name ""Footloose"", and the duo held the AJPW All Asia Tag Team Championship on three occasions between March 9, 1988 and October 20, 1989; their standout rivalries were against Shunji Takano and Shinichi Nakano, as well as against the Can-Am Express (Dan Kroffat and Doug Furnas). When Revolution stable mate Ashura Hara was expelled from All Japan in 1988 for gambling debts, Kawada teamed with Tenryu in that year's World's Strongest Tag Determination League, losing a memorable final match to Stan Hansen and Terry Gordy. In the summer of 1990, after Tenryu and a number of All Japan wrestlers jumped to Tenryu's newly formed Super World of Sports promotion, Kawada became Mitsuharu Misawa's main partner in the Jumbo Tsuruta & Co. vs. Misawa & Co. feud. As part of the feud, Kawada had very heated rivalry with Tsuruta's main partner, Akira Taue. Misawa and Kawada would win the Unified World Tag Team Championship twice, as well as the 1992 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. He gained his first Triple Crown shot on October 24, 1991 challenging Tsuruta, and was also turned back in the following year in Triple Crown challenges to Stan Hansen (June 5, 1992) and Misawa (October 21, 1992); the match with Hansen was named Match of the Year by Tokyo Sports, and finished second behind the Misawa match in Weekly Pro Wrestling's year end fan poll for Match of the Year. In early 1993, after it became apparent that Tsuruta's days as a competitive wrestler were over, AJPW promoter Giant Baba asked Kawada to team with his rival Taue, thereby leaving Misawa's group. Kawada and Taue went to a draw in the 1993 Champion Carnival and ended their feud with a handshake. In their first title match as a team, Kawada & Taue defeated Unified World Tag Team Champions Terry Gordy & Steve Williams. Immediately afterwards, they successfully defended the titles against Misawa and Kenta Kobashi on June 1, 1993 in a match that Baba (at the time) regarded as the greatest match he'd ever seen; it was the first of nine legendary matches between the sides, and Kawada would hold the AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championships with Taue six times. Kawada won the 1994 Champion Carnival by defeating Steve Williams on April 16, 1994. Kawada followed by dropping his third straight Triple Crown challenge against Misawa in the June 3, 1994 ""Singles Match of Decade""; in a 36-minute showstopper, Kawada & Misawa displayed some of the stiffest wrestling ever seen. After Williams lifted the Triple Crown from Misawa, Kawada defeated Williams on October 22, 1994; his title reign lasted one successful defense, as he went to a one-hour draw with Kenta Kobashi in Osaka on January 19; it has been called the greatest one hour match in pro wrestling history by Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer. Stan Hansen ended Kawada's Triple Crown reign on March 4, 1995. Kawada pinned Misawa for the first time on June 9, 1995, when he teamed with Taue to face Misawa and Kobashi, but Misawa and Kobashi came back to defeat them in the Tag League Final in the last straight tag meeting of the two teams. All-Japan Ace (1996–2005). Kawada spent much of 1996 in Giant Baba's doghouse for publicly questioning All Japan's isolationist promotional policy at a time when rival New Japan drew record business running interpromotional matches; he watched Taue and Kobashi win the Triple Crown in the place of what looked to be the time for ""his push"". Kawada worked one interpromotional match on a major UWFi show, but All Japan chose not to follow-up on either a promotional feud with UWFi nor on the sudden attention Kawada drew. He was allowed out of the doghouse in time for Kawada & Taue to break through in 1996 to win the World's Strongest Tag Determination League for the first time, beating Misawa and Jun Akiyama. Kawada pinned Misawa for the first time in a singles match in the 1997 Carnival Finals mini-round robin, then followed up to pin Kobashi the same night to win the Canival championship for the second time; neither win had quite the impact one would expect given the results. Kawada and Taue would take their second straight World Tag League championship to close out year that saw both spend much of it in the shadows of Misawa and Kobashi. The crowning moment of Kawada's career came on May 1, 1998, as he pinned Misawa for the second time to win the Triple Crown at All Japan's first Tokyo Dome show. However, he was promptly defeated by Kobashi on June 12, 1998 in his first title defense. After receiving little singles push over the last half of 1998, Kawada was given (with no build up) a Triple Crown match against Misawa on January 22, 1999; in something of a surprise, Kawada took his second straight Triple Crown match against Misawa to win with title for the third time. However, he broke his arm during the match and vacated the title the following day. He also inadvertently invented what many call the most dangerous finisher in wrestling history- the ganso Bomb. Kawada was attempting a powerbomb on Misawa but couldn't lift him high enough because of his broken arm and dropped him on his head. Kawada returned in May 1999, but would revert to the sidelines due to an eye injury in August. He didn't return until January 2000, but suffered high profile losses to Kobashi, Vader and Misawa. In June 2000, Kawada and Taue won the Unified World Tag Team Championships for the sixth time, breaking a record they shared with not only Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu, but Terry Gordy and Steve Williams as well. Following the June 2000 series, Misawa and all but two native talent in All Japan resigned from their positions and defected to the newly formed Pro Wrestling Noah promotion; Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi were the only two native talent to stay with All Japan Pro Wrestling. With the promotion gutted of top talent, Kawada's old mentor Genichiro Tenryu was brought back and an interpromotional agreement was struck with New Japan; the first key match against New Japan saw Kawada defeat IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kensuke Sasaki on October 9, 2000 in a non-title match. On September 6, 2003, he won the Triple Crown for the fifth time in a tournament final against Shinjiro Ohtani. This time, however, Kawada embarked on a magnificent reign with 10 successful title defenses against the likes of Genichiro Tenryu, Shinya Hashimoto, Jamal, Taiyō Kea, Kensuke Sasaki and Hiroyoshi Tenzan; as a result, Kawada broke Misawa's record of 8 defenses during Misawa's third reign. In addition, 2004 became only the second year when the Triple Crown did not change hands (the first was 1993, during Misawa's first reign), which included a successful defense against Mick Foley in the HUSTLE promotion; in Misawa's era, the title was not defended during the Champion Carnival and World's Strongest Tag Determination League tours, which were dedicated to their namesake tournaments. Kawada's reign restored dignity to the Triple Crown at the expense of the said tournaments. Freelance (2005–present). After losing the titles to Satoshi Kojima on February 16, 2005, Kawada signed a contract with Dream Stage Entertainment, the parent company of PRIDE Fighting Championships. Kawada made the sports entertainment based HUSTLE promotion his new home, and immediately turned heel in 2005; he turned his back on his young student Taichi Ishikari and friends Shinjiro Ohtani & Naoya Ogawa of the HUSTLE Army to join the dastardly Monster Army, led by Nobuhiko Takada & swimsuit model Yinling the Erotic Terrorist. Due to the way Kawada's contract with DSE was structured, he was free to work where he pleased (including New Japan Pro Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Noah, and other various independent groups). However, when All Japan reopened relations with FEG to begin running WRESTLE-1 shows again in 2005 with the parent company of PRIDE's biggest competitor in Japan (that being the K-1 fighting group, ran by FEG), DSE requested that Kawada not work for All Japan any longer because of the conflict of interest. On July 18, 2005 at the Tokyo Dome, Kawada wrestled one final 27-minute classic against his old rival Mitsuharu Misawa. In July 2006, All Japan officially ended their relationship with FEG. Kawada immediately expressed interest to work in his home promotion once again, and finally made his long-awaited return on July 30, 2006 defeating D'Lo Brown. Following his win of the Triple Crown on 3 July 2006, Taiyo Kea named Kawada as the first challenger for the title, and the match was held at the inaugural PRO WRESTLING LOVE in RYOGOKU event on 27 August. However, Kawada was unsuccessful, falling to his own finishing maneuver (the Powerbomb). Kawada continued to compete in both All-Japan and HUSTLE, as well as defeating Shinsuke Nakamura at the All-Japan/New Japan ""Wrestle Kingdom"" supershow on January 4, 2007 with a running kick to the face. At PRO WRESTLING LOVE in RYOGOKU, Vol. 2 (on February 17, 2007), Toshiaki Kawada and Taiyo Kea defeated RO'Z and Suwama for the Unified World Tag Team Championship; this win gives Kawada his 9th reign with the championship, as well as Kea's 5th reign. From March 26–30, 2007, Toshiaki Kawada competed in the year's Champion Carnival tournament, going all the way to the finals where he fell to Keiji Mutoh; Kawada finished the tournament with 5 points (2 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw). During the Hold Out Tour on April 22, 2007, Toshiaki Kawada lost to Vampiro, after the Great Muta had interfered and sprayed mist in Kawada's eyes. Muta and Vampiro later challenged Kea and Kawada for the Unified World Tag Team Championships at PRO WRESTLING LOVE in NAGOYA '07 (on April 30), but Kawada and Kea were successful in their defense of the belts. On June 24, 2007, Satoshi Kojima turned his back on All-Japan Pro Wrestling and aligned himself with All-Japan's arch nemesis, the VooDoo Murders group; this angered Kawada, who had left All-Japan for Kojima to lead when he lost the Triple Crown in 2005. On August 26, 2007 at PRO WRESTLING LOVE in Ryogoku, Vol. 3, Kawada and Kea lost the Unified World Tag Team Championship to Satoshi Kojima and TARU. On September 16, following the conclusion of the opening show for the 2007 Flashing Tour, Kawada issued a challenge to Kensuke Sasaki for the Triple Crown Championship; Sasaki accepted, and Kawada will challenge for the title at All-Japan's 35th Anniversary ""PRO-WRESTLING LOVE in YOYOGI"" show on October 18, 2007. Kawada will also team with Ryuji Hijikata to challenge Sasaki and Katsuhiko Nakajima on September 29, 2007 at the final show of the Flashing Tour. On October 3, 2009, at the Misawa Mitsuhara memorial show, Kawada and Akira Taue reunited the Holy Demon Army for one night and defeated Jun Akiyama and KENTA. Three weeks later, he defeated Masato Tanaka to win the Zero1 World Heavyweight Championship. Kawada would return to NOAH in late February 28 trading victories with Takeshi Morishima. Two weeks Later, Kawada would then be announced as a part of NOAH's Inaugural ""Global League"" tournament. "

wikipedia-2322629," Baby Geniuses  Baby Geniuses (also known as Baby Talking (ベイビー・トーキング) in Japan) is a 1999 family-oriented comedy film directed by Bob Clark, rated PG for ""some rude behavior and dialogue"". It stars Kathleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd. Computer-generated imagery effects were used to digitally superimpose moving lips over babies' mouths, an effect similarly used in ""Clutch Cargo"", but many critics pointed the effect out as being unnerving. The catchphrases for the movie are ""Think Innocent, Think Helpless, Think Again!"" and ""Naps are History"". This movie is also considered as one of the worst movies of all time. In 2004 it was followed by a sequel, """", which had an even worse critical reaction than the original and bombed at the box-office.

wikipedia-2322673," Julie Driscoll  Julie Tippetts (born Julie Driscoll, 8 June 1947, London, England) is an English singer and actress, known for her 1960s versions of Bob Dylan's ""This Wheel's on Fire"", and Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"", both with Brian Auger & The Trinity. Along with The Trinity, she was featured prominently in the 1969 television special 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee, singing ""I'm a Believer"" in a soul style with Micky Dolenz. She and Auger had previously worked in Steampacket, with Long John Baldry and Rod Stewart. ""This Wheel's on Fire"" reached number five in the United Kingdom in June 1968. With distortion, the imagery of the title and the group's dress and performance, this version came to represent the psychedelic era in British music. Driscoll recorded the song again in the early '90s with Adrian Edmondson as the theme to the BBC comedy series ""Absolutely Fabulous"", whose main characters are throwbacks to that era. Since the 1970s, Driscoll has concentrated on experimental vocal music, married jazz musician Keith Tippett and collaborated with him. Her name is now 'Julie Tippetts', thus using the original spelling of her husband's surname. She participated in Keith Tippett's big band Centipede and, in 1974, took part in Robert Wyatt's Theatre Royal Drury Lane concert; released a solo album, ""Sunset Glow"" in 1975; and was lead vocalist on Carla Bley's album ""Tropic Appetites"" and in John Wolf Brennan's ""HeXtet"".

In the early 1980s, Julie Tippetts was a guest vocalist on an early single by pop-jazz band Working Week, on the song ""Storm of Light"", which brought them the attention of a wider audience. Though the band later continued with other vocalists - notably with Tracey Thorn of Everything but the Girl fame and the band's long term staple, another Julie, last name Roberts - it was this single that marked the band's arrival and a brief infatuation from the British and European public with stylish pop incorporating a strong jazz flavor, thus marking Julie Tippetts, née Driscoll, as a vocalist for every age. Discography. Here is a list of her selected work sorted mostly by recording date: "
wikipedia-2322706," Copiapó  Copiapó () is a city in northern Chile, located about 40 miles east of the coastal town of Caldera. Founded on December 8, 1744, it is the capital of Copiapó Province and Atacama Region. Copiapó lies about 800 km north of Santiago by the Copiapó River, in the valley of the same name. In recent years, the river has dried up. The town is surrounded by the Atacama Desert and receives little rain (12 mm per year). The population of Copiapó was 9,128 in 1903, 11,617 in 1907 and, as of 2002, there are 129,091 inhabitants.  Copiapó is in a rich silver and copper mining district. It possesses a bronze statue of Juan Godoy, discoverer of the Chañarcillo silver mines in the 19th century. The Copiapó-Caldera railway line, built in 1850, was the first one in South America. The first section between Caldera and Monte Amargo was inaugurated on July 4 of 1850 in honour of the nationality of William Wheelwright, the American business man responsible for the project. The original wooden railway station is now a National Monument. History. The town was christened ""San Francisco de la Selva de Copiapó"" or Saint Francis of the Jungle of Copiapó, due to its lush vegetation. Prior to Spanish occupation, the area was inhabited by the Diaguita people under the rule of the Inca Empire. The earliest archaeological remains of human activity in the Copiapó Valley have been dated at ten thousand years BP. Copiapó was, until the annexation of Antofagasta and Iquique during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), Chile's northernmost city and main mining city. On 5 August 2010, a copper/gold mine collapsed, leaving 33 miners trapped underground. The miners survived underground for 69 days until their rescue on 13 October 2010, a record period of time. Demographics. According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Copiapó had 129,091 inhabitants (64,922 men and 64,169 women). Of these, 125,983 (97.6%) lived in urban areas and 3,108 (2.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 27.9% (28,184 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. According to the same census, the religious affiliation in Copiapó, is the following: Climate. Copiapó has an desert climate (Köppen climate classification ""BWh/BWk"") with mild temperatures year round. Winters are mild with warm temperatures during the day, with a July maximum of and cool temperatures during the night, averaging . Temperatures rarely fall below freezing. Most of the precipitation falls during this time of the year with June and July being the wettest months. While winters are normally dry, precipitation is highly variable.

The average annual precipitation is though this is highly variable with some years recording no precipitation such as in 1970, 1978, 1990, 1992-1993 and in 1998 and other years where precipitation is recorded. There are 3.2 days with measureable precipitation. The record high was in August 1972 and the record low was in June 1975. Economy. Copiapó has a diversified and potential economy, but mining is the largest economic activity. The Copiapó Basin has a great deal of copper ore, mined by companies such as Minera Candelaria, which extracts copper near Tierra Amarilla, a neighboring commune. This generates a need for transportation, light industry, and services. ""Small mining"" represents over 30% of the production. The copper obtained by ""pirquineros"" (miners) goes to the copper smelter at Paipote.  Agriculture is the second largest source of income in this area. It consists largely of grape production, with olives, tomatoes, avocados and some citrus fruits also playing a part. Industry: Copiapó has mainly light industry, and some medium industry such as the INACESA plant and Paipote copper refinery.  Commerce is growing in Copiapó, largely old and new small and medium enterprises. Downtown Copiapó activity mirrors Copiapó's progress Some native enterprises have grown rapidly in the last decade such as the Albasini and Don Álvaro chain-stores. Free-market policies along with a higher demand and better economic expectations have encouraged the arrival of big, national enterprises such as the supermarkets Deca (1999), Jumbo (2005), and Lider (2006).  Tourism in Copiapó has been developing in the last years. An example of this is the new Casino, and the new infrastructures hotels had to invest in, due to the excess of demand by domestic and foreign tourists.  Significant attractions of Copiapó are the Mineralogic Museum, Plaza de Armas, Regional Museum of the Matta Family, the Wooden Railway Station, the San José Cooper Mine (closed in 2010); in the coast, Totoralillo, Totoral and the zone of ""Travesía"", wherein after rain, occurs the so-called ""Desierto Florido""; in the Andes, the Ojos del Salado volcano, and the lakes Green and Negro Francisco, and also the Tres Cruces National Park. Administration. Municipal Government. Brief History of Recent Municipal Politics. Since the return to democracy in 1990, there have been five mayoral elections held in Copiapó. In 1992, Mónica Calcutta (PPD) won the election against 24 candidates. Her term was characterized by public expenditures on green areas, parks, and street paving, and public infrastructure such as the new building of the City Hall (1994), the Estadio Techado (1996), and the Technological School (inaugurated in 1997). During her term, Calcutta encouraged people to participate. One of these activities was the ""Train of History"" carried out in 1994 (for the 250th anniversary of Copiapó) and 1995. Despite all these expenditures, the City Hall ended up with no debt for 1996.  In 1996, Calcutta ran for the re-election, but was defeated by the socialist candidate Marcos López (city councilor 1992–1996) by a narrow margin of 146 votes. López's term differed substantially from Calcutta's; his first three years as mayor did not see any important public expenditures in visible things. They came out the year before the following election. The 2000 election was a very confrontational one. López and Calcutta ran for election together with 10 other candidates. In spite of surveys that showed a virtual tie between them, López won the election with an overwhelming 50.07% of the votes to his rival's 31.52%. López's second term in office was characterized by high public expenditures, part of it from the Central Government to improve Chilean infrastructure toward the bicentennial of Independence. These expenditures went towards redesigning the Central Square, Matta Avenue and the City Chamber. In 2004, Marcos López was elected to another term, defeating the rightist candidate René Aedo (RN) with 50.01% to 40.82% of the votes. In 2008, López run for a fourth term, but was defeated by the independent candidate Maglio Cicardini Neyra, by a margin of less than 1% of the votes. Congressional Representation. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Copiapó is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Lautaro Carmona (PC) and Carlos Vilches (UDI) as part of the 5th electoral district, (together with Chañaral and Diego de Almagro). The commune is represented in the Senate by Isabel Allende Bussi (PS) and Baldo Prokurica Prokurica (RN) as part of the 3rd senatorial constituency (Atacama Region). Education. Copiapó provides public and private education, from kindergarten to high school, and also technical and bachelor's degrees. Schools. According to the Departament of Education of Chile, Copiapó had (2007) an enrollment of more than 35.000 students, divided in the following programs: Kindergarten, 3.780 students; Differencial Education, 1.009 students; Elementary and Middle School, 20.794 students; High School, 10.291 students (5.185 in Scientific-Humanist programs and 5.106 in Technical-Professional programs).  La commune of Copiapó offers public and private education held by 64 schools, divided in: 61 urbans and 3 rurals; 32 public, 23 State-subsidized private schools and 9 private schools. Sports & Recreation. Soccer. In 2009 began the reparation of the Luis Valenzuela Hermosilla Stadium, and it is expected to be concluded by September 2011. Raid Atacama. This is the event that gathers the most 4x4 automobiles in the world, and it began in 1992. The effort and spirit of Raid Atacama has made it worthy of the National Award for Tourism. For over 21 years, the Atacama Raid has been the cornerstone of the development of off-road activities along Chile, and its example has been followed by many clubs and even several companies. In the last seven years, the enrollment has kept steady on an average of about 500 vehicles per event, and more than 1,800 participants from all regions of the country and abroad. In 1997, it reaches the largest number of participants to date, bringing together 613 4x4 vehicles, which allowed to apply for registration as a world record, with no other event to date of its magnitude. Another of the achievements is to hold, without competition, the record for international off-road event (amateur) with greater permanence in time. Rally Dakar. In the last years, Copiapó has been not only one of the Chilean communes the Rally Dakar Chile-Argentina has passed through, but also the place of birth of Jaime Prohens, one of the most importants runners of this rally. Copiapó UFO sighting. Copiapó was said to be the site of an unidentified flying object sighting in 1864. According to researcher Chris Aubeck, the story first appeared in print in the March 18, 1868 issue of the newspaper ""El Constituyente"", which was itself cited in the journal ""The Zoologist"" then in ""Lo!"", a 1931 book by American investigator Charles Fort. Fort's account was the basis of a later account in ""Anatomy of a Phenomenon"" (1965) by ufologist Jacques Vallee. "
wikipedia-2322715," Kalusha Bwalya  Kalusha Bwalya (born 16 August 1963 in Mufulira), known as simply Kalusha or ""Great kalu"", is a Zambian footballer, former coach and President of the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). He is Zambia's most capped player, all-time top goalscorer second to Godfrey 'Ucar' Chitalu, and is regarded as the greatest Zambian soccer player. He was named African Footballer of the Year in 1988 by the magazine ""France Football"", and was nominated for the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year where he was voted the 12th-best player in the world, the first to be nominated after playing the entire year for a non-European club. His older brother Benjamin Bwalya played professional football, and his younger brother Joel Bwalya also played for the Zambia national football team. His cousin, Robert Earnshaw currently plays for Cardiff City and the Welsh national football team. International career. Bwalya was a member of the national squad that participated at the 1988 Olympic Games, making his mark with a most famous hat-trick in a 4–0 victory against Italy. At the full international level, he appeared in 147 international matches and scored 100 goals from 1983 to 2004. He debuted against Sudan in April 1983 at Dag Hammarskjoeld Stadium in a Cup of Nations qualfier in Ndola, and scored his first goal against Uganda in a World Cup qualifier the following year at the same venue. He has appeared in multiple tournaments, including six editions of the African Cup of Nations. Although he was captain of the national football team during the qualification matches for the 1994 World Cup, Kalusha was not on the ill-fated flight on 27 April 1993 when the entire team and its management were killed when the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon. Kalusha Bwalya, Africa's most famous ""Number 11"", took on the mantle of spearheading the revival of the national side the following year, captaining the side to the Runners-Up spot at the CAF African Nations Cup 1994 in Tunisia—where they succumbed to the Super Eagles of Nigeria; this was to be the peak of his own career and Zambian football for a long time to come. The national team finished in 3rd place at the next edition of the Africa Cup in South Africa in 1996, with Kalusha jointly winning the Golden Boot Award as the topscorer at the tournament. He was a player-coach during the African 2006 World Cup qualification matches. On 5 September 2004, Zambia played Liberia, and the match was tied 0–0 minutes before the end. Kalusha, aged 41, came off the bench during the second half, and marked his 147th appearance with his 100th goal for the country, scoring from a trademark direct free kick to give Zambia a 1–0 victory and the lead of Africa's Group 1. However, Zambia finished third and failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Despite the failure to qualify, Bwalya coached Zambia at the 2006 African Cup of Nations. Following their elimination in the first round, however, Bwalya resigned from his post. Kalusha's dream of holding the coveted AFCON trophy came 2012 when the Zambia National Football Team, which was underestimated by many football pundits upset the star-studded Ivory Coast to win the final of the 2012 tournament. As Zambian FA President, he joined the players and lifted the cup in a country where his former teammates perished in an aircraft disaster. He has nevertheless remained actively involved in international football, contributing to the 2006 World Cup as a member of FIFA's Technical Study Group. He was also one of the ambassadors of the 2010 World Cup which was held in South Africa. Club career. Bwalya's career in Europe began at Cercle Brugge in Belgium. In his first season, he was the club's top scorer and was twice voted supporters' player of the year. Such was his impact that Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven took him to the Eredivisie, and he describes winning the championship twice in 1990/91 and 1991/92, under Bobby Robson, as a career highlight. He jokingly adds that: ""Most of the time we played in the opponents half, because the team was so good. You know, we had Romario, Gerald Vanenburg, Eric Gerets, Wim Kieft and Hans van Breukelen and just to be with that group, to train with them day in, day out, was an experience."" Bwalya's next stop was Club America, to whom he moved in 1994. The Mexican club's home ground is the legendary Azteca, an arena of which the Zambian icon has very fond memories. As he told FIFA.com: ""I am privileged to have played in the best stadium in the world – and to have been able to call it my home ground."" The Mexico experience in general was cherished by Bwalya, who devoted almost eight years of his career to the country and recalls his time there as ""probably the best of my life"". On the international front, his earliest achievement was arguably one of the most remarkable hat-tricks in modern football history, with three-times World Cup champions Italy on the receiving end in a 4–0 win for the Zambians at the 1988 Olympics. Bwalya acknowledges that the result was a surprise, but adds: ""Zambia is a sleeping giant in a way. It is a small country in terms of football, but we were the first African team to beat a European power as convincingly as that."" Administrative career. He currently serves as a standing committee member at FIFA and the Confederation of African Football and as of 2008 is the president of the Football Association of Zambia. Previously he was vice president. In the first half of 2006, Bwalya resigned from his position as the Zambia coach but having served as vice president of the Football Association of Zambia until 2008, he was voted in to be president as of 2008. This was as a result of pressure from members of the Football Association of Zambia as well as the media. As of May 2008 Hervé Renard was the coach of the Zambia National Soccer Team. His now football association of Zambia since 2008 and on 23 February he was elected as CAF executive commit member. "
wikipedia-2322758," Independent Police Complaints Commission  The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is a non-departmental public body in England and Wales responsible for overseeing the system for handling complaints made against police forces in England and Wales. A parliamentary inquiry set up in the wake of the death of Ian Tomlinson concluded in January 2013 that, ""It has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt.""  Role. It can also elect to manage or supervise the police investigation into a particular complaint and will independently investigate the most serious cases itself. While some of the IPCC's investigators are former police officers, the commissioners themselves cannot have worked for the police by law. It has set standards for police forces to improve the way the public's complaints are handled. The IPCC also handles appeals by the public about the way their complaint was dealt with by the local force, or its outcomes. The IPCC was given the task of increasing public confidence in the complaint system. It aims to make investigations more open, timely, proportionate and fair. Since April 2006 the IPCC has taken on responsibility for similar, serious complaints against HM Revenue and Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency in England and Wales. In April 2008, it additionally took on responsibility for serious complaints against UK Border Agency staff. Powers. The statutory powers and responsibilities of the Commission are set out by the Police Reform Act 2002, and it came into existence on 1 April 2004, replacing the Police Complaints Authority. It is a Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB), funded by the Home Office, but by law entirely independent of the police, interest groups and political parties and whose decisions on cases are free from government involvement. Since 1 April 2004 the IPCC has used its powers to begin 353 independent and 759 managed investigations (as of 31 March 2009) into the most serious complaints against the police. These included deaths in police custody, shootings and fatal traffic incidents. It also handles more than 4,500 appeals a year from members of the public about the way their complaint was dealt with by the local force, or its outcomes. Investigations. The vast majority of complaints are dealt with by the Professional Standards department of the police force the complaint is about. The IPCC's independent investigators investigate the most serious complaints, for example where someone has died following contact with the police. There are a number of types of incidents that the police, or other agencies the IPCC oversees complaints for, must mandatorily refer to the Commission. These include deaths in police custody, shootings and fatal traffic incidents as well as allegations that an officer or member of police staff has committed a serious criminal offence. Forces may also refer matters voluntarily to the IPCC and the Commission can 'call in' any matter where there might be serious public concern. Once a matter has been referred, the IPCC will make a ‘mode of investigation’ decision to determine how it should be dealt with. This is done by caseworkers or investigators who submit an assessment to a Commissioner. The assessment will involve judging the available information and may mean IPCC investigators are sent to the scene. The four modes of investigation are: Should new information emerge after a mode of investigation has been decided the IPCC can change the classification both up and down the scale. IPCC Investigators are not police officers. However, IPCC investigators designated to undertake an investigation have all the powers and privileges of a police constable in relation to that investigation throughout England and Wales (Police Reform Act, 2002- Schedule 3, Paragraph 19). However, despite being established in April 2004, the first known use of these arrest powers was in 2007 when a former police officer was arrested in relation to allegations of sexual assault. Structure. The IPCC is overseen by a Chair, ten operational and two non-executive Commissioners. The Chair is a Crown appointment and Commissioners are public appointments. The IPCC's Commissioners and staff are based in IPCC regional offices in Cardiff, London, Sale and Wakefield. The IPCC's Chief Executive, is Jane Furniss CBE who is responsible for running the organisation which supports the work of the Commission. Furniss is also the IPCC's Accounting Officer and is accountable to the Home Office Principal Accounting Officer and to Parliament. As well as employing its own independent investigators to investigate the most serious cases, the IPCC has staff performing a number of other functions. Caseworkers handle the majority of complaints that are referred to the organisation. They will record the details of the complaint and make an assessment of the case and recommend a method of investigation, which will then be passed to a Commissioner for sign off. They also assess appeals from the public concerning the outcome of police decisions regarding complaints. The IPCC also takes a lead role in developing new policy for the complaints system and for police practices. For example, following research about the circumstances into deaths following police activity on roads a new policy was drafted. This has now been adopted by ACPO and the government is making it law for police to follow. Commissioners. The IPCC's ten operational Commissioners and two non-executive Commissioners are appointed by the Home Secretary for a five or three-year period. The Chair is appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary. Commissioners by law may not have served with the police at any time, been the Chair or a member of SOCA at any time or been a Commissioner or officer of Customs at any time. They are the public, independent face of the IPCC. The Commission is the governing board of the IPCC, holding collective responsibility for governance of the Commission including oversight of the Executive. As public office holders, Commissioners oversee IPCC investigations and the promotion of public confidence in the complaints system (known as Guardianship). Each Commissioner also has responsibility for a particular portfolio such as firearms, deaths in custody, road policing and youth engagement. Commissioners in making decisions on individual cases act under the delegated authority of the Commission. All appointments, which are full-time and non-executive are for a five-year term, were through open competition. The commission meets bi-monthly and dates can be found on the IPCC website. The Commissioners are- Northern Ireland and Scotland. The IPCC self-regulation scheme covers England and Wales; oversight of the police complaints system in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. In Scotland it is the responsibility of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland (PCCS) for non-criminal complaints, or the Procurator Fiscal, part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service where there are allegations of criminality. Police Action Lawyers Group resignations. In February 2008 over a hundred lawyers who specialise in handling police complaints resigned from its advisory body, citing various criticisms of the IPCC including a pattern of favouritism towards the police, indifference and rudeness towards complainants and complaints being rejected in spite of apparently powerful evidence in their support. The IPCC responded to these criticisms with a letter to ""The Guardian"", in which the then IPCC Chair Nick Hardwick acknowledged some cases could have been handled differently in its infancy, but pointed out that despite repeated requests for the group to provide contemporary examples where expectations had not been met, there had been no further cases identified. It has been noted that ""no policeman has ever been convicted of murder or manslaughter for a death following police contact, though there have been more than 400 such deaths in the past ten years alone."". Although a number of these were determined (by inquest juries) to be suicides, other cases such as that of Ian Tomlinson, were found by inquest juries to be 'unlawful killings'. There have been a number of police officers convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, including those responsible for the deaths of Hayley Adamson and Sandra Simpson. Parliamentary Inquiry 2012. On 27 June 2012 the Home Affairs Committee announced an inquiry into the IPCC including, but not limited to, analysis of the independence of the Commission, the powers and responsibilities of the Commission and the effectiveness of Commission investigations. The Committee began hearing evidence on 17 July 2012. The report was published on 29 January 2013 and was scathing, describing it as ""woefully underequipped and hamstrung in achieving its original objectives. It has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt."" "
wikipedia-2322812," Ajit Khan  Hamid Ali Khan (27 January 1922–22 October 1998), better known by his stage name Ajit (), was a prolific Hindi film actor. He acted in over two hundred movies in almost four decades. Ajit is also credited for starring as a lead actor in popular Bollywood movies such as ""Nastik"", ""Bada Bhai"", ""Milan"", ""Bara-Dari"", and later as a second lead in ""Mughal-e-Azam"" and ""Naya Daur"". Biography. Early life. Born Hamid Ali Khan, near the historic place Golconda, Hyderabad, Ajit had his early education in Warangal, studied in Govt. Junior College, Hanamkonda, Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh. Hamid was the son of Bashir Ali Khan, who was in the Nizam's army, and had a younger brother, Wahid Ali Khan. Hamid entered the film industry to become a hero and did quite a few creditable films as lead artiste in ""Nastik"", ""Bada Bhai"", ""Milan"", ""Baradari"", ""Dholak"" and later as a second lead in ""Mughal-e-Azam"" and ""Naya Daur"". Film director K. Amarnath, who directed him in ""Bekasoor"", suggested that the actor change his long name of Hamid Ali Khan to something shorter, and Hamid zeroed in on “Ajit”. Career. Ajit, who ran away from home to Mumbai after selling his college books, started his career in films in the 1940s. Luck did not favour him in the initial stages. He began with the 1946 movie ""Shahe Misra"", acting opposite Geeta Bose, and also did films such as ""Sikander"" (van mala), ""Hatimtai"" (1947), ""Aap Beeti"" (Khursheed), ""Sone Ki Chidiya"" (Leela Kumari), ""Dholak"" (Meena Shori) and ""Chanda Ki Chandni"" (Monica Desai) as leading hero, but flopped. He did most of films (15) with Nalini Jaywant. Ajit switched over to play the villain. His first movie as a villain was ""Suraj"" and with films such as ""Zanjeer"" and ""Yaadon Ki Baaraat"", there was no looking back for him. In the mid-seventies he had acted in over 57 films, mostly as a villain. His dialogue delivery remains popular even to this date. His colleagues in the film industry —leading personalities who have acted with him, grown seeing him in Mumbai — have expressed deep sorrow over the death of the legendary actor. Writer Javed Akhtar, who scripted ""Zanjeer"", said: ""Like Bachchan, Ajit found a new image as villain after Zanjeer. He started a new innings in his career though he was an established hero in the fifties. His villainy started a new trend. Here was a new villain who was soft-spoken yet forceful. We wanted to give a different image to villainy which matched the hero."" Family. He had five sons- Shahid Ali Khan, Zahid Ali Khan, Abid Ali Khan, Shehzad Ali Khan and FILM and TV actor Arbaaz Ali Khan. Reactions to Ajit's death. Another ""villain"" Amrish Puri said Ajit's death is a sad loss to films. ""Ajit developed his own style of acting and delivery of dialogue. We still remember his style of acting which is guidance to the new generation of actors."" Prem Chopra, who starred with Ajit in many films including ""Jugnu"", ""Chupa Rustom"" and ""Ram Balram"" as a father and son team, said Ajit was devoted in his work. ""He had a subtle sense of humour. He was a cultured man. We had a common interest -- reciting Urdu shairi."" New-generation villain Kiran Kumar was shocked to hear that ""his Ajit uncle"" had died. ""Our relationship was more personal than professional. I must have been hardly eight or ten years when my father (veteran character actor Jeevan) used to take me to Paradise Bakery opposite which was Ajit's residence. Father would call him by his first name Hamid, and would call him down. Ajit would come down, wearing lungi and jaali banian to chat with my father."" Acting style. Ajit almost always portrayed the sophisticated, educated, well groomed evil mastermind, albeit heartless villain. Ajit was presented in striking western attire, the ""bold"" checked suits, matching overcoats, white leather shoes, wide sunglasses, jewellery accessories etc. Given his stature as a senior artist; Ajit was usually the gang leader to second tier villains (such as Jeevan, Prem Chopra, Ranjit, Kader Khan, Sujit Kumar). He was rarely portrayed (in movie roles) doing any ""dirty work"" himself, rather relaying on his army of henchmen for the task, with zero tolerance for any failures. He always had a savvy female accomplice, usually named ""Mona."" Acting in over 200 films, he specialized in playing suave villains with memorable catch-phrases delivered in now iconic Ajit style nasal drawls such as ""Mona, darling"". Ajit also brought to fame the smuggler as the villain. In his movies, he is generally seen smuggling ""gold biscuits"" in or out of the country. It has also been noted that most of his gang members had Christian names like Robert, Michael, Peter etc. This also has been used for comic purposes in parodies. It was the menacing voice he was most famous for. He is still remembered for bringing the most famous villains in the history of Indian cinema to life. His contemporaries include veteran actors like Amrish Puri, Pran, Prem Chopra and Amjad Khan. Some of his popularity in present time is due to the innumerable jokes and parodies made on his famous lines by comedians. "
wikipedia-2322822," Brown Berets  The Brown Berets are a Chicano/Mexican American community organization that emerged during the Chicano Movement in the late 1960s and remains active to the present day. The group was seen as part of the Third Movement for Liberation. The Brown Berets focus on community organizing against police brutality and advocate for educational equality. Several groups have been quite active since the passage of California Proposition 187. Units exist in most sections of California and a few in other southwestern states. Brown Beret member and former Watsonville Mayor Oscar Rios was quoted in an interview as saying,""It (California) belonged to us, Mexico, 1848. It was taken away okay, so it's no surprise we're taking it back slowly but surely."" Predecessors. In 1966 as part of the Annual Chicano Student Conference in Los Angeles County, a team of high school students discussed different issues affecting Mexican Americans in their barrios and schools. Among the students at the conference were Vickie Castro, Jorge Licón, John Ortiz, David Sanchez, Rachel Ochoa, and Moctesuma Esparza. These high school students formed the Young Citizens for Community Action the same year, and worked together to support Dr. Julian Nava's campaign as a Los Angeles school board member candidate in 1967. Sanchez and Esparza had trained with Father John B. Luce's Social Action Training center at the Church of the Epiphany (Episcopal) in Lincoln Heights and with the Community Service Organization. The organization's name was then changed to Young Chicanos For Community Action or ""YCCA"". In 1967, the YCCA founded the Piranya Coffee House. In September 1967, Sal Castro, a Korean War veteran and teacher at Lincoln High School, met with the YCCA at the Piranya Coffee House. The group decided to wear brown berets as a symbol of unity and resistance against discrimination. As a result, the organization gained the name ""Brown Berets"". Their agenda was to fight police harassment, inadequate public schools, inadequate health care, inadequate job opportunities, minority education issues, the lack of political representation, and the Vietnam War. It set up branches in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, New York, Florida, Chicago, St. Louis and other metropolitan areas with large ""RAZA"" populations. Actions. By September 1968, the Brown Berets became a national organization having opened chapters California, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, and Indiana. In 1969, Brown Berets Cristo Cebada produced and distributed a newspaper called ""La Causa."" They also participated in organizing the first free medical clinics and free breakfast programs. Women held an important role in the writing and distribution of ""La Causa"", but even though this was so, the Brown Berets, as the rest of the Chicano Movement, did not fully take women into strong leadership positions. The jobs assigned to women in the Brown Berets consisted of office type jobs and clerical/secretarial jobs. Sexism within the Brown Berets was evident. Brown Berets saw themselves as liberated men and ignored the women's struggle because they, male Brown Berets, believed that the feminist movement was a white women's movement and that above all, first came the liberation of the La Raza. One female Brown Beret, Grace Reyes, in charge of writing for La Causa, constantly wrote articles about women within the Brown Berets/the Chicano Movement and the sexist attitudes towards them but they were not published and ignored. Most Brown Beret women believed and insisted that a successful revolution ""must have full involvement from both Chicanas and Chicanos"". Carlos Montes, one of the co-founders, in an interview talks about the lessons learned from the Brown Berets, ""Building a mass militant movement to the stop the US war drive, for social change and for revolution is key. Also rebuilding grassroots militant organizations in the community that fight for self-determination, social justice and liberation - not just for reforms. We need an organization that includes the participation of the entire family and that values and promotes the leadership of women."" The Brown Berets also came to be known for their direct action against police brutality. They protested killings and abuses perpetrated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department at the station in the barrio. They supported the United Farm Workers movement and the Land Grant Movement in New Mexico. In 1969, they participated in the first Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton) which originally included the Young Patriots and the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez and in the Poor Peoples Campaign. In 1969, they were invited to be part of the first Chicano Youth Liberation Movement organized by Corky Gonzales in Denver, Colorado.  The Brown Berets organized the first Chicano Moratorium against the Vietnam War in 1970, and a few months later the National Chicano Moratorium in which close to 20,000 Chicanos marched and protested the high casualty rate of Chicanos in Vietnam and the military draft. This peaceful protest became chaotic when the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department decided to end the event by attacking attendees. Three Chicano activists were killed (two of them Brown Berets), including journalist Rubén Salazar. Also in 1970, The Brown Berets de Aztlan and other community activist organizations took over a piece of land in Logan Heights (a community of San Diego) because the city of San Diego wanted to build a California Highway Patrol Substation and the community didn't want that. That little piece of land just under the Coronado Bridge, marked by Chicano graffiti-art on the first bridge pillars, is now called Chicano Park.  In 1972, twenty-six Brown Berets occupied the Santa Catalina Island and claimed it for Mexico. However, by this time, the organization had been weakened by internal conflicts and police and FBI infiltration. Activity in other regions. The Brown Berets set up the Benito Juarez Health Clinic (BJHC) in Chicago in 1972. This was a health clinic that provided free medical care to everyone in the Chicago area. Working in conjunction with Cook County Hospital and other major hospitals in the Chicago area, BJHC served the needs of the uninsured and those with no ability to pay for health care services. It was located at 1831 S. Racine, in the Casa Aztlán Center, the community building located on the south side of Chicago, just outside downtown Chicago. The Center Director was Ms. Dorthy Cutler.  The Brown Berets also fought on public education issues. The organization occupied a middle high school called Frobel Middle 9th Grade School. The Brown Berets, alongside families, community members and students, took over the school for a full day. At the end of the day, the Chicago Police arrived to remove people from the occupied school. That evening, a riot broke out, in which many rioters and one policeman were injured as the police were trying to disperse the crowd. Six police cars were also destroyed. The community wanted a school built in their community, and in 1979 a school was built in the Pilsen community, now called the Benito Juarez High School. In El Monte, California, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Brown Berets often supported each other in marches against the Vietnam War and jail conditions at the Bexar County Jail. SNCC ran African American candidates for State offices under the La Raza Unida Party and often supported Mexican American activists. In Washington State, the Brown Berets originated in Granger, Washington. The group was then transplanted to Seattle as students from the Yakima Valley were recruited to the University of Washington in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Seattle Chapter worked with the chapter in Yakima, Washington in attempting to organize various projects including the formation of a 'La Raza Unida Party' in Washington. It is believed that the group was initiated first in 1968, with the Seattle chapter emerging in 1969. The organization would attract over 200 members throughout the state. Although having a short-lived presence (approximately from 1968 to 1984), the Brown Berets would be instrumental in organizing youth and college students. Of note was the organization's partaking in the occupation of the old Beacon Hill School in Seattle, which led to the founding of ""El Centro de la Raza"", now one of Seattle's most prominent civil rights organizations. Activism also transcended the organization's early phase, with many former member establishing various community institutions to meet the needs of the local community. April 22, 1970. The San Diego Brown Berets (now known as National Brown Berets de Aztlan) took over a piece of land in Logan Heights that was supposed to be a highway patrol sub-station. That piece of land under the Coronado bridge is now known as Chicano Park. November 1, 1972. Brown Berets were infiltrated by government employees and subversives working for outside organizations including but not limited to the FBI, LAPD, CWP, ATF, and other law enforcement agencies and organizations working to co-opt the Movimiento Chicano to ensure protection of the United States.  The then Prime Minister David Sanchez tried to disband the organization After a National meeting held in Albuquerque, NM at the Alianza Head Quarters where thousands of Brown Beret Members voted Sanchez out. Then to save face he called for a Press Conference to dis-ban the organization. The only chapter who continued organizing was the San Diego Chapter, later becoming the National Brown Berets de Aztlan. Also changing the patch from ""La Causa"" to ""Aztlan"". 1990s. A new Brown Beret organization that emerged calling itself the ""Brown Beret National Organization"" sues David Rico and The National Brown Berets de Aztlan over the Brown Beret name. Eventually losing the case and thus further proving the originality of the Brown Berets de Aztlan. See the article written here BBNO sues The Brown Berets de Aztlan January 2011. During a session discussing the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act at California State University, Fresno on January 6, 2011, a Brown Beret member spoke out of turn and was taken out of the building by the police officers and detectives. In agreement, others in the audience argued that California lands that had previously belonged to Mexico were acquired by the United States in an unlawful manner.

wikipedia-2322845," Thiago Motta  Thiago Motta (born 28 August 1982) is a Brazilian-Italian professional footballer who plays for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in Ligue 1, as a central midfielder. Having spent his early career at Barcelona, his main traits are physical presence, good passing, and a powerful mid-range shot, but he is also known to be injury-prone. He also played two and a half seasons with Internazionale, winning 11 major titles between the two clubs combined. An Italian citizen before his arrival in Europe (he is of Italian descent), Motta represented its national team since 2011, appearing with it at Euro 2012 and helping it finish second. Club career. Barcelona. Born in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Motta signed with FC Barcelona in 1999 at age 17, from local Clube Atlético Juventus, initially being assigned to the club's B-side. He eventually graduated to the senior team in 2001, making his first team debut on 3 October against RCD Mallorca in a 3–0 home win. In the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League, Motta made seven appearances and helped his team to the semi-finals. In the 2002–03 season in La Liga, he appeared in a career-best 21 games (with three goals) as ""Barça"" could only finish in sixth position, and also played an important part in the following season's long UEFA Cup run, which was eventually ended by Celtic; in the first leg, a 0–1 loss in Glasgow (0–1 on aggregate), he was sent off during half-time after hitting out at opposing goalkeeper Robert Douglas, who was also shown the red card, in an incident that happened in the tunnel. Motta was also dogged by several injuries, particularly one suffered on 11 September 2004 against Sevilla FC, which sidelined him for seven months, during his time at Barcelona. He would eventually need surgery to rebuild the anterior cruciate and lateral ligaments in his left knee, but was able to make a swift recovery and made an emotional comeback, taking to the field to rapturous applause as eventual league champions defeated Getafe CF 2–0 on 17 April. Atlético Madrid. In late August 2007 Motta signed a one-year contract with Atlético Madrid, for an undisclosed fee. Once again, he began the season on the sidelines, injured; in the Copa del Rey quarterfinal match against Valencia CF, he was sent off after only 25 minutes, and the ""Colchoneros"" lost the away fixture 0–1 and subsequently the tie. Due to injury to regular starter Raúl García and the departure of Maniche in January 2008, Motta's opportunities increased. In March, however, the recurrent knee problems reappeared, and his season was over, followed by a successful surgery and rehabilitation in the United States; following his release he trialed with Premier League side Portsmouth, but did not sign for the club. Italy. In September 2008 Motta joined Genoa C.F.C. on a free transfer, after passing a medical. During his first campaign he performed consistently well and was a regular in the starting eleven, under coach Gian Piero Gasperini. On 11 April 2009, Motta scored two goals (one of them in the first half's injury time) in a final 3–2 home win over Juventus FC. He finished the year with a career-best six goals, and his club qualified for the Europa League. On 20 May 2009 ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"" confirmed that Motta, alongside teammate Diego Milito were transferred to Inter Milan for €28M (Milito)+€10.2M (Motta). As part of the deal, Genoa received five Inter players: Robert Acquafresca, Francesco Bolzoni, Leonardo Bonucci, Ivan Fatic and Riccardo Meggiorini; his agent Dario Canovi later revealed that his Genoa contract with the club included a buy-out fee of €10 million. Motta's debut came in the 2009–10 season's opener, a 1–1 home draw against A.S. Bari, and his first goal came the next round as he opened the scoresheet in the ""Derby della Madonnina"" after an assist by Milito, as Inter defeated A.C. Milan 4–0. Having been in and out of the team for the duration of the campaign, he netted his first brace for Inter in a 3–0 win against Bologna F.C. 1909 on 3 April 2010. Motta also appeared in eight games during the club's victorious Champions League campaign, including the 0–1 loss at former side Barcelona for the semifinals (3–2 aggregate win). During that match, he was sent off after apparently striking Sergio Busquets in the face with his hand; the incident gathered attention due to Busquets' apparent feigning of injury. On 23 October 2011, from a corner taken by Wesley Sneijder, Motta scored through a header in a 1–0 win against A.C. ChievoVerona, which was Inter's first home win in the 2011–12 season. Paris Saint-Germain. On 31 January 2012, in spite of Inter manager Claudio Ranieri indicating shortly before he was confident the player would remain with the club until the end of the season, having called him to the upcoming league match against U.S. Città di Palermo, Motta signed with Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in France, for a fee believed to be around €10 million. Following his move, he revealed that he dreamt of playing for the club ever since compatriots such as Raí, Leonardo and Ronaldinho shone in the French capital; he also revealed that he was not happy at Inter, refusing to further elaborate on his reasons to leave. Four days after signing for the club, Motta made his debut for PSG, against Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. in a 3–1 home win, being booked in the process. On 22 April 2012, in another home fixture, he scored his first goal in Ligue 1, contributing to a 6–1 victory over FC Sochaux-Montbéliard. International career. Motta made his debut for Brazil in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Although he played with the U-23 team, it was a full international competition, hence the international cap gained was fully recognized by FIFA; he went on to appear in another two games in the tournament, and previously represented the nation at the 1999 South American Under-17 Football Championship. Motta missed the 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injuries, but appeared for the U23 team in November 2003 against Santos FC. Subsequently, reported claims that he wanted to be called up for Italy and possibly to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as he possessed dual nationality – both grandparents from his mother and father's side being Italian. FIFA granted players to have one chance to change their representing nation if they had dual nationality, but not for players who have already played in a competitive ""A"" match (non-friendly). On 6 February 2011 Motta received his first call-up from Italy, for a friendly against Germany, but an official statement from the Italian Football Federation declared it subject to FIFA clearance, which was granted two days later; he was replaced in the 63rd minute of the 1–1 draw by Alberto Aquilani. On 25 March 2011, in only his second international, a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier in Slovenia, Motta scored the game's only goal, following a 73rd-minute combination with Federico Balzaretti. He was selected to the finals in Poland and Ukraine, starting in three group stage matches for the ""Azzurri"" and adding two substitute appearances, against Germany in the semifinals (2–1 win) and Spain in the final: in the decisive match, after having again replaced Riccardo Montolivo, in the 55th minute, he suffered an hamstring injury after only five minutes and had to be himself carried off, leaving his team with ten players – he was the third player brought in by manager Cesare Prandelli – in an eventual 0–4 loss.

wikipedia-2322898," Getaddrinfo  The codice_1 and codice_2 functions are part of the POSIX standard application programming interface (API) for converting domain name system (DNS) hostnames and IP addresses between their human-readable text representations and structured binary formats for the operating system's networking API. getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() are inverse functions of each other. This set of functions is fully network protocol agnostic and supports both IPv4 and IPv6. It is the recommended interface for name resolution in building protocol independent applications and for transitioning legacy IPv4 code to the IPv6 Internet. Internally, the function needs to perform some form of DNS lookup by calling other, lower level function like codice_3. The file resolv.conf determines the behaviour of this lookup and can be modified by the system user. struct addrinfo. The C data structure used to represent addresses and hostnames within the networking API is the following: In recent operating systems the type of ai_addrlen has been changed from size_t to socklen_t. Most socket functions, such as accept and getpeername, require a socklen_t* parameter and programmers often pass the address to the ai_addrlen element of the addrinfo structure. If the types are incompatible, e.g., on a big-endian 64-bit Solaris 9 system where size_t is 8 bytes and socklen_t is 4 bytes, then run-time errors may result. It is interesting to note that the structure contains an ai_family and a sockaddr structure with its own sa_family field. These are set to the same value when the structure is created with the getaddrinfo() function in some implementations. getaddrinfo(). getaddrinfo() converts human-readable text strings representing hostnames or IP addresses into a dynamically allocated linked list of struct addrinfo structures. The function prototypes for these functions are specified as follows: The function returns 0 upon success and negative if it fails along the way. Although implementations vary among platforms, the function will first try and get a port number usually by branching on ""service"". If the string value is a number, it will convert it to an integer using htons(). If it is a service name like ""www"" it will lookup the service by calling getservbyname(), using the protocol derived from hints->ai_socktype as the second parameter to that function. Then, If a ""hostname"" is given (not NULL), It will also call gethostbyname() to do a name-to-IP resolution otherwise it will assign an address of 0.0.0.0 if the hints->ai_flags is set to AI_PASSIVE and 127.0.0.1 otherwise. It will then call malloc_ai in one of these conditions and pass the port retrieved at the beginning to allocate an addrinfo structure filled with the appropriate sockaddr_in. It will finally dereferencing the ""**res"" parameter to make it point to a newly allocated ""addrinfo"" structure. In some implementations (like the Unix version for Mac OS), the hints->ai_protocol will override the hints->ai_socktype value while in others it is the opposite, so both need to be defined with equivalent values for the code to be cross platform. getnameinfo(). getnameinfo() converts the internal binary representation of an IP address in the form of a struct sockaddr pointer into text strings consisting of the hostname or, if the address cannot be resolved into a name, a textual IP address representation, as well as the service port name or number. The function prototype is specified as follows: freeaddrinfo(). This function will free the memory allocated by the getaddrinfo() function. As the result of the latter is a link list of addrinfo structures, freeaddrinfo() will loop through the list and free each one it turn Example. The following example uses getaddrinfo() to resolve the domain name ""www.example.com"" into its list of addresses and then calls getnameinfo() on each result to return the canonical name for the address. In general, this will produce the original hostname, unless the particular address has multiple names, in which case the ""canonical"" name is returned. In this example, the domain name will be printed three times, once for each of the three results obtained. "
wikipedia-2322909," Eirik Bakke  Eirik Bakke (born 13 September 1977 in Sogndal) is a Norwegian retired football player. He played on the right-hand side or centre of midfield. Club career. Sogndal (1993-1999). Bakke played 99 matches for Sogndal. His father Svein formerly played for the team. Leeds United (1999-2006). Bakke was bought by Leeds United in 1999 from Sogndal for £1.75 million. After an encouraging start to his career at Leeds in 1999 and 2000, injuries and poor form meant that he never quite became a mainstay of the Leeds squad, even after the club was relegated from the Premiership in 2004. Bakke's career has been blighted by recurrent knee injuries. Patella tendinitis kept him out of the team for the start of the 2004-05 season and he was struck with a torn cruciate ligament on his return in January 2005. In August 2005, having recovered from his injury, Bakke was loaned to Aston Villa. The loan however was ended early after Leeds told Villa that they would only let Bakke go permanently, not on loan and Doug Ellis, Villa's chairman at the time, decided that it was not worth permanently acquiring his services. Speculation continued as to Bakke's future when he was left out of the Leeds United squad for the match against Sheffield Wednesday on 27 August 2006 with some in the press and supporters speculating that this was due to an imminent transfer. A club statement was released on 29 August 2006 by Leeds United effectively stating that Bakke had played his last game in Leeds United colours. Bakke however stated he would like to stay at the club, and still trained with the club, despite not playing, not wanting to return to playing in Norway at that point in time. The problem arose due to his £23,000 a week wages and £4,000 appearance fees, which were originally agreed during Ridsdale's """"Living The Dream"""" era, but which the club could no longer afford to pay in the league they were currently playing in. Leeds United tried to resolve the issue by attempting to meet Bakke half way so that the player could stay at the club on lesser wages but Bakke's agent stated he wanted the contractually agreed wage. The situation did not look good for Bakke, with Leeds chairman Ken Bates having already terminated Seth Johnson's contract due to excessive wages as part of a determined effort to make Leeds a successful and profitable club once more. Bakke left, being the third last 'O'Leary player' left at Leeds. Return to Norway: SK Brann (2006-2010). On 31 August 2006, Bakke signed a two-year deal with SK Brann, and returned home to Norway. The deal was financed by Hardball. Certain media outlets have claimed that Bakke and Brann have a ""gentlemen's agreement"", that Bakke can leave Brann if a big club wants to sign him, though this has been denied by Brann. Bakke has stated that he still has ambitions to prove himself in Europe before bringing his career to a close in Norway. Bakke debuted for Brann on 11 September 2006 against Stabæk, in a match best remembered for a two-feet tackle by Joakim Persson of Stabæk on Bakke that could easily have ended Bakke's career. Bakke started the 2007 season playing for Brann 2 in a bid to regain full fitness from his injury problems. He has experienced a bit of a stop-start season, making his first full Tippeliga start on 26 June 2007. Eirik Bakke has been mostly noticed for his no-nonsense approach and English inspired tackling in midfield, but also managed to score the winning goal against arch-rivals Rosenborg BK on 11 August 2007. Bakke has promised Brann that when he is close to retirement he would finish his career in Norway with the club, playing a further 1-2 seasons. In front of the 2008 season, Bakke became captain of Brann. On 30 May 2008, Bakke extended his Brann deal out 2010. However his new deal had a clause giving Bakke the chance to re-evaluate his deal, if the club decided to lay artificial turf at Brann Stadion. A few weeks later, Brann announced that the club will continue with natural grass as the turf at Brann Stadion also in the coming years. Sogndal (2011-2012). He signed a two-year deal with Sogndal in 2011. In November 2012 he decided to retire as an active player. International career. He made his debut for Norway in a January 1999 friendly match against Israel, coming on as a substitute for Egil Østenstad and earned 26 caps since, scoring no goals. His last international match was an March 2008 friendly match against Montenegro, coming on as a substitute for Martin Andresen. Career statistics. ¹ includes FA Cup, and Norwegian Football Cup. ² Include Champions League and UEFA Cup. Extra Personal Info. Eirik Bakke is known as a keen music lover. He stated in popular Norweigen and Danish magazine Se Og Hør that he favours British bands such as Coldplay or The Beatles. Though he did say in that same interview ""my favourite band has to be The Arctic Monkeys, they are special"".  He also displays support for British football teams like Arsenal and Manchester United, but he does not think that he will ever get the chance of playing for a club as big as them. "
wikipedia-2322912," Firearm Owners Protection Act  The Firearm Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), , codified at et seq., is a United States federal law that revised many provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968. Federal Firearms License regulatory reform. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) was given wide latitude on the enforcement of regulations pertaining to Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders. Allegations of abuse by ATF inspectors soon arose from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and certain targeted Federal firearms licensees. In the ""Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session"" (February 1982), a bipartisan subcommittee (consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats) of the United States Senate investigated the Second Amendment and reported its findings. The report stated: It concluded that seventy-five percent of ATF prosecutions were ""constitutionally improper"", especially on Second Amendment issues. The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 addressed the abuses noted in the 1982 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee report. Among the reforms intended to loosen restrictions on gun ownership were the reopening of interstate sales of long guns on a limited basis, legalization of ammunition shipments through the U.S. Postal Service (a partial repeal of the Gun Control Act), removal of the requirement for record keeping on sales of non-armor-piercing ammunition, and federal protection of transportation of firearms through states where possession of those firearms would otherwise be illegal (See: 18 USC § 926A http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926A ). However, the Act also contained a provision that banned the sale of machine guns manufactured after the date of enactment to civilians, restricting sales of these weapons to the military and law enforcement. Thus, in the ensuing years, the limited supply of these arms available to civilians has caused an enormous increase in their price, with most costing in excess of $10,000. Regarding these fully automatic firearms owned by private citizens in the United States, political scientist Earl Kruschke said ""approximately 175,000 automatic firearms have been licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (the federal agency responsible for administration of the law) and evidence suggests that none of these weapons has ever been used to commit a violent crime."" The gun rights movement lobbied Congress to pass the FOPA to prevent the abuse of regulatory power — in particular, to address claims that the ATF was repeatedly inspecting FFL holders for the apparent purpose of harassment intended to drive the FFL holders out of business (as the FFL holders would constantly be having to tend to ATF inspections instead of to customers). The Act mandated that ATF compliance inspections can be done only once per year. An exception to the ""once per year"" rule exists if multiple record-keeping violations are recorded in an inspection, in which case the ATF may do a follow-up inspection. The main reason for a follow-up inspection would be if guns could not be accounted for. Machine Gun Ban. As debate for FOPA was in its final stages in the House before moving on to the Senate, Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.) proposed several amendments including House Amendment 777 to H.R. 4332 that would ban a civilian from ownership or transfer rights of any fully automatic weapon which was not registered as of May 19, 1986. The amendment also held that any such weapon manufactured and registered before the May 19 cutoff date could still be legally owned and transferred by civilians. Specifically, FOPA restricts the transfer and possession of machine guns except for “transfers to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision thereof."" The ATF, as a representative of the United States and with authority from the National Firearms Act, can authorize the transfer of a machine gun to an unlicensed civilian. An unlicensed individual may acquire machine guns, with ATF approval, from its lawful owner residing in the same state as the individual. The transferor must file an ATF application, which must be completed by both parties to the transfer and executed under penalties of perjury, and pay a $200 transfer tax to ATF. The application must include detailed information on the firearm and the parties to the transfer. The transferee must certify on the application that he or she is not disqualified from possessing firearms on grounds specified in law. He or she must submit with the application (1) two photographs taken within the past year; (2) fingerprints; and (3) a copy of any state or local permit or license required to buy, possess, or acquire machine guns. An appropriate (local) law enforcement official must also certify whether he or she has any information indicating that the firearm will be used for other than lawful purposes or that possession would violate state or federal law. Anyone acquiring a machine gun must, as part of the registration process, pass an extensive Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background investigation. If ATF denies an application, it must refund the tax. Gun owners must keep approved applications as evidence of registration of the firearms and make them available for inspection by ATF officers. In the morning hours of April 10, 1986, the House held recorded votes on three amendments to FOPA in Record Vote No's 72, 73, and 74. Recorded Vote 72 was on H.AMDT. 776, an amendment to H.AMDT 770 involving the interstate sale of handguns; while Recorded Vote 74 was on H.AMDT 770, involving primarily the easing of interstate sales and the safe passage provision. Recorded Vote 74 was the controversial Hughes Amendment that called for the banning of machine guns. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), at the time presiding as Chairman over the proceedings, claimed that the ""amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to."" However, after the voice vote on the Hughes Amendment, Rangel ignored a plea to take a recorded vote and moved on to Recorded Vote 74 where the Hughes Amendment failed. The bill, H.R. 4332, as a whole passed in Record Vote No: 75 on a motion to recommit. Despite the controversial amendment, the Senate, in S.B. 49, adopted H.R. 4332 as an amendment to the final bill. The bill was subsequently passed and signed on May 19, 1986 by President Ronald Reagan to become Public Law 99-308, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. ""Safe Passage"" provision. One of the law's provisions was that persons traveling from one place to another cannot be incarcerated for a firearms offense in a state that has strict gun control laws if the traveler is just passing through (short stops for food and gas), provided that the firearms and ammunition are not immediately accessible, that the firearms are unloaded and, in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver’s compartment, the firearms are located in a locked container. Under this provision, someone driving from Virginia to a competition in Vermont with a locked hard case containing an unloaded handgun and a box of ammunition in the trunk could not be prosecuted in New Jersey or New York City for illegal possession of a handgun provided that the individual did not stop in New Jersey or New York for an extended period of time. See 18 USC § 926A http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926A Registry prohibition. The Act also forbade the U.S. Government agency from keeping a registry directly linking non-National Firearms Act firearms to their owners, the specific language of this law (Federal Law 18 U.S.C. 926 (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926) being: Nevertheless, the ATF Firearms Tracing System (FTS) contains hundreds of millions of firearm tracing and registration records, and consists of several databases: National Background Check. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 created a national background check system to prevent firearms sales to prohibited persons. In order to comply with the prohibition on a Federal registry of non-NFA items, background check records are legally required to be destroyed after 24 hours. Clarification of prohibited persons. The older Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits firearms ownership in the US by certain broad categories of individuals thought to pose a threat to public safety. However, this list differed between the House and the Senate versions of the bill, and led to great confusion. This list was later augmented, modified, and clarified in the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. The 1986 list is: These provisions are stated in the form of questions on Federal Form 4473. In 1999, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the ""Lautenberg Amendment"", 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8), violated the Second and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and was therefore unconstitutional, in ""United States of America v. Timothy Joe Emerson"", This decision was subsequently reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals two years later; see ""U.S. v. Emerson"". The Supreme Court did not grant certiorari, a necessary first step for further examination by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that overturned the domestic violence ban stands, but is binding on federal courts only in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. "

wikipedia-2322953," Lahore Resolution  The Lahore Resolution (, ""Qarardad-e-Lahore""; Bengali: লাহোর প্রস্তাব, ""Lahor Prostab""), also known as the Pakistan Resolution (, ""Qarardad-e-Pakistan""), was a formal political statement adopted by the All-India Muslim League on the occasion of its three-day general session in Lahore on March 22–24, 1940, which called for the creation of 'independent states' for Muslims in British India. The constituent units of these states were to be autonomous and sovereign. The resolution was later interpreted as a demand for a separate Muslim state, called Pakistan. The resolution was presented by A. K. Fazlul Huq. Although the name ""Pakistan"" had been proposed by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in his Pakistan Declaration in 1933, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other leaders had kept firm their belief in Hindu-Muslim unity. However, the volatile political climate and sidelining of Muslims by Indian National Congress showed the future of the Muslims in the subcontinent not so bright and gave the idea stronger backing. Proceedings. The session was held between March 22 and March 24, 1940, at Iqbal Park, (Lahore)The welcome address was made by and Choudhry Rehmat Ali , president, All India Muslim league, Punjab. He was also chairman of the reception committee and personally bore all the expenses for the marriage. In his speech,Sikander Hayat Khan recounted the contemporary situation, stressing that the problem of d.g.khan was no more of and nature, but manifestly an natinal. According to Stanley Wolpert, this was the moment when Jinnah, the former ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, totally transformed himself into Pakistan's great leader. According to some , Sikandar Hayat Khan, the chief minister of the Punjab, was the sole author of the original Lahore resolution. However, Khan Abdul Wali Khan differs and attributes the authorship of the Resolution to Sir Muhammad Zafarullah Khan. Sir Sikandar Hayat's Unionist Party had swept the elections in Punjab and provided support to Jinnah at the urging of Sir Mohammad Allama Iqbal resulting in the Sikander-Jinnah pact. Sir Sikandar convinced his classfellow Fazlul Haq, premier of Bengal, to support Jinnah as well. Sikandar supported the British in the Second World War at the request of Sir Winston Churchill after all of India's political parties had refused. The British promised dominion status to India after the war. After his suspicious death other players moved in. Sikandar did not envisage partition of his beloved Punjab. When he learnt of the intended partition of Punjab he rejected this outright. The strike by the Khaksaar Tahreek and subsequent killing of their workers was a spoiler and an attempt by their leader to hijack the freedom movement. The Tahreek had supported the Germans and Japanese during the war. Due to civil unrest it was decided that Sir Fazlul Haq would present the resolution. The resolution text unanimously rejected the concept of a united India on the grounds of growing inter-communal violence and recommended the creation of an independent Muslim state. After the presentation of the annual report by Liaquat Ali Khan, the resolution was moved in the general session by A.K. Fazlul Huq, the chief minister of undivided Bengal and was seconded by Choudhury Khaliquzzaman who explained his views on the causes which led to the demand for partition. Subsequently, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan from Punjab, Sardar Aurangzeb Khan Gandapur from the North-West Frontier Province, Sir Abdullah Haroon from Sindh, and Qazi Esa from Baluchistan, and other leaders announced their support. In the same session, Jinnah also presented a resolution to condemn the Khaksar massacre of March 19, owing to a clash between the Khaksars and the police, that had resulted in the loss of 32 lives. The statement. The Lahore resolution was actually adopted on March 24, but officially in Pakistan March 23 is considered the date of its adoption. In 1941, it became part of the Muslim League's constitution. In 1946, it formed the basis for the decision of Muslim League to struggle for one state for the Muslims. The statement declared: Additionally, it stated: Pakistan resolution in the Sindh Assembly. The Sindh assembly was the first British Indian legislature to pass the resolution in favour of Pakistan. G. M. Syed, an influential Sindhi activist, revolutionary and Sufi and one of the important leaders to the forefront of the provincial autonomy movement joined the Muslim League in 1938 and presented the Pakistan resolution in the Sindh Assembly. This text was buried under the Minar-e-Pakistan during its building in the Ayub regime. In this session the political situation was analyzed in detail and Muslim demands a separate homeland only to maintain their identification and to safeguard their rights. Pakistan resolution was the landmark in the history of Muslim of south-Asia.it determined for the Muslims a true goal and their homeland in north-east and north-west. the acceptance of he Pakistan resolution accelerate the pace of freedom movement. it gave new energy and courage to Muslim who gathered around Quaid-i-Azam for struggle for freedom.

wikipedia-2322976," Head girl and head boy  Head girl and head boy are roles of prominent pupillary responsibility. The terms are commonly used in the British education system, and in private schools throughout the Commonwealth. United Kingdom and Ireland. In some British schools, the pupil body (or the headteacher) may elect a head boy and/or a head girl from the pupils. Head boys and head girls are usually responsible for representing the school at events, and therefore must be able to make public speeches. He or she may also be expected to lead fellow prefects in their duties. Deputy head boys and girls may also be appointed, taking on the day-to-day management of the prefects in some institutions, as well as looking after the school and creating a link between teachers and pupils. Other Commonwealth countries. Outside of the United Kingdom, many public schools throughout the Commonwealth, particularly in the Caribbean and Asia, use the term head boy or head girl. Many other countries instead elect a president or captain of the student government or senior prefect. However, the title continues to be used for the elected head of the pupillary government at private schools, as well as maintaining currency throughout New Zealand, where almost every secondary school has a head boy and/or girl. All schools in Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, UAE and Malaysia, and many in the Commonwealth Caribbean, as well as South Africa, follow the same system as that in the United Kingdom, having a head girl and head boy or head prefect, a vice-head girl/boy, prefects, house captains, monitors and class representatives. The head girl and boy assist the teachers and administration of the school. Ghanaian schools follow a similar system although some schools appoint a head prefect or senior prefect and assistant senior prefect. In Australia, the system is much the same as that of the United Kingdom. Almost all public secondary schools will have a student council with each year group having elected representatives. There are rarely any vice or deputy roles, with these positions being taken up by the student councillors. The student council is in charge of assisting with the organisation of social events and fund-raising events within the school. In general, it is the main liaising body between the students and staff. The head boy and head girl are generally the ""chair"" of this council and will represent the school on a government or community level and will represent the students at the school level. They are usually required to present speeches as part of this role, and so should be good at public speaking. Upper Canada College in Toronto, St. Andrew's College in Aurora, and Ridley College in St. Catharines, Ontario, are all independent schools that use the title ""head boy"" differently, applying it to the student who has achieved the highest academic standing in his graduating class; similar, in principle, to the valedictorian at an American high school. What would otherwise be known as head of school at an equivalent British institution is known at Upper Canada College as the head steward. Outside the Commonwealth. The term has become familiar to international readers through the ""Harry Potter"" books; Hogwarts School is loosely based on British public schools. Schools in other parts of Europe also know this function. In the Netherlands high schools are using the term class representative (""""klassenvertegenwoordiger"""") instead of head girl or -boy. "
wikipedia-471851," Samba de Amigo  The music in ""Samba de Amigo"" is made of primarily popular Latin music songs rather than common or traditional samba. The game also features non-Latin pop songs. Gameplay. ""Samba de Amigo"" is played with a pair of maracas. As a song plays, the player, guided by on-screen graphics, must shake the maracas at high, middle, or low heights with the beat of the music, or occasionally must strike poses with the maracas held in various positions. The player is represented on-screen by Amigo, a monkey. If the player does well, the scene around the monkey (usually a concert or a dance) will attract more people and become more vividly animated; if the player does poorly, characters leave and eventually all that's left is the monkey alone, looking sad. In the primary game mode, each player has six spots arranged in a circle on the screen: two red meaning 'shake high,' two yellow meaning 'shake middle,' and two green meaning 'shake low.' Blue dots will appear in the center of this circle and move towards the spots; as soon as the blue dot touches a spot, the player must shake a maraca at that location. For example, if a blue dot touches the upper left spot, the player must shake either maraca above his left shoulder. If both maracas are shaken in that location, the player gets an 'Amigo' bonus. Occasionally a long line of dots will flow into a spot and the word 'Shake' appears, telling the player to continue shaking his maraca rapidly there. Sometimes a stick-figure (named ""Pose"") appears on the screen holding its maracas in a certain position; the player has a second or two to match the figure's pose for points. Game modes. In the original arcade game, the player is given two or three stages to play through, depending on how the options are set. Each stage has three songs to choose from. If the player does well enough on each stage, an additional Special stage is enabled, where three of the more challenging songs are made available. In the Dreamcast port, this version of the game is playable as Arcade mode. Original mode is the same game, except that instead of being limited to three songs in each stage, the player gets to choose from any song in the game that has been unlocked. Initially, six songs are available in this mode, while more can be unlocked by playing the Arcade or Challenge modes. The home game also adds a Party mode, with minigames such as Guacamole (pronounced and played much the same as ""whack-a-mole""), Strike A Pose (consisting of a long sequence of poses to make), and 1-2-Samba! (where spots must be hit in sequence - the Japanese version's name for this minigame, ""Ichi Ni San-ba,"" is a pun on counting to three in Japanese). Also included in Party mode is the Battle game, where two players compete to score high combos and knock out their opponent, and the Couples game (known as ""Love Love"" in Japan), where two players play through a song to test their ""compatibility"". Along with this, the home version has features which can be unlocked, such as alternate sound effects and downloadable songs. Finally, a Challenge mode has been added, where the player is given specific goals in order to proceed through stages. These goals include having to reach a certain letter grade or to pass a certain score while playing a song. There are 25 challenges total, separated into five stages. Maraca controllers. The original arcade game used red maraca controllers modeled after their in-game design. Magnetic sensors were used to determine their position. As this was an expensive process, it had to be reworked for the home version. In the Dreamcast version, each maraca has a cord which is plugged into to a bar that lies in front of the player's feet. The bar is slightly more than two feet in length and has a sensor at each end, and each maraca has an ultrasonic transmitter mounted on its cord; this allows the system to triangulate the position of each maraca. The rattle part can be unscrewed from the top of each maraca for quieter play. Included in the box is a plastic mat with two brown footprints, which helps players properly position themselves in relation to the sensor bar. With the exception of the ""Ver. 2000"" sequel, the maracas were never officially used for any other games, though they can be used with Namco's ""Mr Driller"" for approximate control of the player's character. A single maraca could also be used to control the SNK produced game ""Cool Cool Toon"". In the Wii version, players use the Wii Remote, in combination with either the Nunchuk or another Wii Remote. Optional, unlicensed third-party maraca attachments are also available. In a Flash version mini game used for the promotion of the Wii version of the game, keys W, D, and C, then O, J, and N is used to tap the drums. The mini game also played an introductory movie showing a family playing the Wii version of the game. Version 2000. ""Samba de Amigo: Ver. 2000"", a follow-up to this game, was released in Japan for the arcades and the Dreamcast. As the name suggests, it is more of an upgrade than a sequel, and it contains 14 new songs, as well as six new downloadable songs for the home version. Whereas in the original game, there were only three songs to choose in each stage, this version allows the player to choose several. ""Love Love/Couples"" Mode, originally available only in the home version of ""Samba de Amigo"", is included in the arcade version of ""Ver.2000"". A new character named Amiga joins the cast. She is Amigo's sister, and wields a tambourine. In the home version, a new volleyball game replaces the original minigames. Survival mode was also added, where the player must finish as many songs in a row as they can. In addition, the Challenge mode has new goals, as well as five new secret stages that are quite difficult. Hustle Mode. The most significant addition to ""Ver. 2000"" is the new ""Hustle Mode"". In this mode, the player must still follow the dots and shake the maracas in the appropriate location, but this is done a lot less often. Instead, Pose appears frequently, and in addition to making the player do static poses, he will be shaking his maracas in certain patterns that the player must mimic. These patterns include either shaking one or both maracas back and forth between two of the six positions, doing a full 360° rotation starting from one position, and looping all the way back around. All the songs in the game, including the ones previously found in the first version, have both Original and Hustle Mode patterns. ""Samba de Amigo Ver. 2000"" was announced for North American release, under the name ""Samba de Amigo Ver. 2001"", but it was among the games that were canceled when Sega discontinued support for their console. Reception. On release, ""Famitsu"" magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the ""Ver.2000"" follow-up a 30 out of 40. After ""Ver.2000"". That same year, Sega released a spiritual successor named ""Shakatto Tambourine"". It was very much the same game as ""Samba de Amigo"", except played with a tambourine controller, and featuring popular J-pop music. ""Samba de Amigo"" also made a comeback of sorts in the EyeToy game ""Sega Superstars"", where player movements recorded by the EyeToy camera were recorded in place of the original maracas. A pair of ""Samba de Amigo"" themed levels appeared in the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game, ""Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure"", which are played using buttons and the system's gyroscope. Wii version. In mid-2007, veteran developers Gearbox Software came up with the idea to port the game to the Wii console, and upon Sega's approval, began working on the new version with Sonic Team as consultants. The default setting of the game uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to simulate the maraca-shaking from the original game, with the option to use two remotes for completely wireless play. Optional maraca-shaped attachments are also available to provide the full experience. Unlike the maraca controls of the Dreamcast version which could detect the height at which they were shaken, the Wii sensor bar is not capable of this. Instead, the angle at which the Wii Remote is being shaken determines if high, mid or low notes are hit. The rotation of the controller also has an effect on note detection, especially when doing cross-over moves. All the characters and stage designs from the original game return with enhanced graphics. Many of the additions from ""Ver.2000"" that were not available to people outside of Japan are included, such as Hustle Mode and the new character Amiga. A ""Career"" mode exclusive to the Wii version is included, consisting of challenges in which players must clear songs to earn various unlockables, including maraca effects and additional songs. Unique to the Wii version, new stages based on other Sega games were added, including ones based on ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" and ""Space Channel 5"", complete with cameos of Sonic and Ulala respectively. Nearly, but not all the songs from the original game are included. It also includes many of the songs from Ver.2000. 23 Wii-exclusive songs were added, bringing the total to 44. The game supports Miis and displays them next to the player's score as well as showing two random ones in-game during stages. Their expressions change based on performance (Bad, Medium, or Good). Online leaderboards and friends lists let players post their best scores and compare them, but only when an original, player-created Mii is used. This feature cannot be used with the guest Miis. In addition, downloadable songs are available for an extra charge. These additional songs come in download packs. The first pack includes the songs ""I Want Candy (cover version)"" by Bow Wow Wow, ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl?"" by Jet, and ""Mambo Mambo"" by Lou Bega (all master tracks), and were available upon the game's release. Download packs come in sets of 3 and cost 500 Wii points. As of December 2008, three download packs have been released. ""Samba de Amigo"" is the first retail Wii title to support the ""pay and play"" portion of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, previously used exclusively by WiiWare titles. Characters. Cameos. Amigo also appears in ""Sonic Pinball Party"", ""Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg"" and ""Sega Superstars"". He is playable in """", ""Sega Superstars Tennis"", and ""Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing"". In the latter, Amigo drives in a Maraca-shaped cart and his All-Star move creates a conga line with other characters as he speeds through the track, then he pushes them back. He also makes a small cameo appearance on the cover of issue 15 of the Sonic X Comic. Two ""Samba de Amigo"" themed levels appear in ""Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure"". Amigo also appears in ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed"", where his vehicle bears resemblance to a toy train. Song list. The original game contained mostly classic Latin songs, while ""Ver.2000"" added a few more contemporary songs from the time. Finally, the Wii version doubled the soundtrack, adding styles from both genres. Covers for the arcade/Dreamcast games were done by Sega's in-house musicians at Wave Master, while the Wii covers were done by WaveGroup Sound, the team known for providing covers and original songs for several modern music games such as Guitar Hero. Blue rows indicate master tracks featuring the original artist; Green rows indicate original tracks. Downloadable songs. Since the Dreamcast release, the internet connectivity of consoles allowed additional songs to be unlocked or downloaded. Dreamcast. In the original Dreamcast games, by selecting the ""Internet"" option in the menu, the player could visit the ""Samba de Amigo"" home page using the game's built-in browser. Here, additional songs are available to unlock, all of which are taken from various games in Sega's library. The songs were not actually downloaded; accessing the internet site simply unlocked hidden songs that were already on the disc. Some could also be unlocked in the Sega superstars version. Wii. Unlike the Dreamcast games, the downloadable content for the Wii version of ""Samba de Amigo"" are pay content that includes master tracks of popular songs, available in packs of three. These are true downloads, saved to the Wii internal memory. Since the game's release in September, three packs have been released. Reception. The Dreamcast version of ""Samba de Amigo"" was met with nearly universal positive reviews, garnering a 89% average at Metacritic. ""Famitsu"" magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 32 out of 40. Critics praised it for its unique and addictive gameplay, while the most common criticism was how the game could not be enjoyed without the expensive Maraca controllers. In addition, ""Samba de Amigo"" won the following awards: Wii version. The game has received mixed reviews overall, ranging from mediocre to positive reception. Eurogamer gave the Wii version 6/10, citing ""the imprecise nature of the controls"", while admitting that ""There's still a decent amount of daft fun to be had out of this joyous little game"". GameSpot gave the Wii version 6/10 as well. Other reviews disagreed, with WorthPlaying saying ""the controls are spot-on 95 percent of the time"" and rating the game an 8.5/10. Nintendo Power also gave the game high marks, awarding it a 9 out of 10. And Gamepro gave the game a 4 out of 5. "
wikipedia-471852," Dextroamphetamine  Dextroamphetamine (dexamfetamine (INN) ) is a psychostimulant drug typically used for the treatment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory, or """"right-handed"""", enantiomer of the amphetamine molecule. The amphetamine molecule has two stereoisomers; levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Names for dextroamphetamine include d-amphetamine, dexamphetamine, and (""S"")-(+)-amphetamine. Dextroamphetamine is available as a generic drug or under several brand names, including Dexedrine and Dextrostat. Dextroamphetamine is also an active metabolite of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), as well as of several older N-substituted amphetamine prodrugs used as anorectics, such as clobenzorex (Asenlix), benzphetamine (Didrex), and amphetaminil (Aponeuron). Common side effects include dry mouth, insomnia and headache. A study has found temporary reduction in growth rate in pediatric use. Medical use. Dextroamphetamine is used for the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy. Adverse effects. Side effects of amphetamine salts include dry mouth, insomnia, drowsiness, dizziness, nervousness, headache and weight loss, diarrhea, as well as faster heartbeat combined with lower blood pressure. Chronic. A study on comparative effects between amphetamine mixed salts (commonly known as adderall) and methylphenidate in children who have been treated for a year or more have shown a temporary decrease in growth rate that does not affect final adult height. Change in weight was reported as slightly greater for amphetamine mixed salts and authors concluded that the result may be clinically insignificant. Studies on rats show long-term neurological and behavioral changes resulting from prenatal and early postnatal exposure to amphetamines. Warnings from the Patient Medication Guide for Adderall include emergence of new psychotic or manic symptoms, aggression and blurred vision. Psychosis. Abuse of amphetamines can result in a stimulant psychosis which may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g. paranoia, hallucinations, delusions). A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine induced psychosis states that about 5-15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. An amphetamine psychosis may also develop occasionally as a treatment-emergent side effect. Military usage. The U.S. Air Force uses dextroamphetamine as one of its ""go pills"", given to pilots on long missions to help them remain focused and alert. Conversly, ""no-go pills"" are used after the mission is completed, to combat the affects of the mission and ""go-pills"". The Tarnak Farm incident was linked by media reports to the use of this drug on long term fatigued pilots. The military did not accept this explanation, citing the lack of similar incidents. Newer stimulant medications or awakeness promoting agents with different side effect profiles, such as modafinil are being investigated and sometimes issued for this reason. Clinical experiments. Though such use remains out of the mainstream, dextroamphetamine has been successfully applied in the treatment of certain categories of depression as well as other psychiatric syndromes. Such alternate uses include reduction of fatigue in cancer patients, antidepressant treatment for HIV patients with depression and debilitating fatigue, and early-stage physiotherapy for severe stroke victims. If physical therapy patients take dextroamphetamine while they practice their movements for rehabilitation, they may learn to move much faster than without dextroamphetamine, and in practice sessions with shorter lengths. Effects. Physical. Physical effects can include anorexia, dilated pupils, vasoconstriction or vasodilation, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension, blood shot eyes, flushing, erectile dysfunction, restlessness, dry mouth, bruxism, headache, tachypnea, fever, diaphoresis, diarrhea, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, reduced seizure threshold, insomnia, numbness, palpitations, arrhythmias, tics, dry and/or itchy skin, acne, and pallor. Effects of extremely high doses can include coma, rhabdomyolysis, adrenergic storm, and stereotypy. Dangerous physical side effects are exceedingly rare in typical pharmaceutical doses. Recent studies by the FDA indicate that, in children, young adults, and adults, there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) and the use of dextroamphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. Psychological. Psychological effects can include euphoria, anxiety, increased libido, alertness, concentration, increased energy, increased self-esteem and self-confidence, sociability, irritability, aggressiveness, grandiosity, hallucinations, repetitive and obsessive behaviors, paranoia, and with chronic and/or high doses, amphetamine psychosis can occur; occasionally this psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses during chronic therapy as a treatment emergent side effect. Withdrawal. Although withdrawal symptoms of Dextroamphetamine are rare, Withdrawal symptoms of dextroamphetamine primarily consist of fatigue, depression and an increased appetite. Symptoms may last for days with occasional use and weeks or months with chronic use, with severity dependent on the length of time and the amount of dextroamphetamine used. Withdrawal symptoms may also include anxiety, irritability, headaches, agitation, seizures, vomiting, akathisia, hypersomnia (excessive sleeping), vivid or lucid dreams, deep REM sleep and suicidal ideation. Overdose. The ""Physician's 1991 Drug Handbook"" reports: ""Symptoms of overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, tachypnea, confusion, aggressiveness, hallucinations, and panic."" Dilated pupils are common with high doses. Repeated high doses may lead to manifestations of acute psychosis. Additionally at least one case report identifies rhabdomyolysis as an associated side effect of dextroamphetamine in the presence of other risk factors. The fatal dose in humans is not precisely known, but in various species of rat generally ranges between 50 and 100 mg/kg, or a factor of 100 over what is required to produce noticeable psychological effects. Although the symptoms seen in a fatal overdose are similar to those of methamphetamine, their mechanisms are not identical, as some substances which inhibit dextroamphetamine toxicity do not do so for methamphetamine. An extreme symptom of overdose is amphetamine psychosis, characterized by vivid visual, auditory, and sometimes tactile hallucinations. Many of its symptoms are identical to the psychosis-like state which follows long-term sleep deprivation, so it remains unclear whether these are solely the effects of the drug, or due to the long periods of sleep deprivation which are often undergone by the chronic user. Amphetamine psychosis, however, is extremely rare in individuals taking oral amphetamines at therapeutic doses; it is usually seen in cases of prolonged or high-dose intravenous (IV) for non-medicinal uses. Chemistry. Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of the amphetamine molecule, which can take two different forms. It is a slightly polar, weak base and is lipophilic. Formulations. Dextroamphetamine sulfate. In the United States, an instant-release (IR) tablet preparation of the salt dextroamphetamine sulfate is available under the brand names Dexedrine and Dextrostat, in 5 mg and 10 mg strengths, and generic formulations from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and recently Wilshire Pharmaceuticals. It is also available as a capsule preparation of controlled-release (CR) dextroamphetamine sulfate, under the brand names Dexedrine SR and Dexedrine Spansule, in the strengths of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. A bubblegum flavored oral solution is available under the brand name ProCentra, manufactured by FSC Pediatrics, which is designed to be an easier method of administration in children who have difficulty swallowing tablets, each 5 mL contains 5 mg dextroamphetamine. In Australia, dextroamphetamine is available in bottles of 100 under the generic name dexamphetamine as 5 mg instant release sulfate tablets., or slow release dexamphetamine preparations may be compounded by individual chemists. Lisdexamfetamine. Dextroamphetamine is the active metabolite of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine (L-lysine-d-amphetamine), available by the trademark name Vyvanse. Lisdexamfetamine is metabolised in the gastrointestinal tract, while dextroamphetamine's metabolism is hepatic. Lisdexamfetamine is therefore an inactive compound until it is converted into an active compound by the digestive system. Although still rated as a Schedule II drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, lisdexamfetamine has a slower onset and its route of administration is limited to being taken orally, unlike dextroamphetamine, Adderall, and methylphenidate, which can be insufflated to achieve a faster onset with a higher bioavailability. Vyvanse is marketed as once-a-day dosing as it provides a slow release of dextroamphetamine into the body. Vyvanse is available as capsules, and in six strengths; 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, and 70 mg. The conversion rate of lisdexamfetamine to dextroamphetamine base is 0.2948, thus a 30 mg-strength Vyvanse capsule is molecularly equivalent to 8.844 mg dextroamphetamine base. Mixed amphetamine salts. Another pharmaceutical that contains dextroamphetamine is Adderall. The drug formulation of Adderall (both controlled and instant release forms) is: Adderall is roughly three-quarters dextroamphetamine, with it accounting for 72.7% of the amphetamine base in Adderall (the remaining percentage is levoamphetamine). An experiment with rats suggested Adderall's inclusion of levoamphetamine provides the pharmaceutical with a quicker onset and longer clinical effect compared to pharmaceuticals exclusively formulated of dextroamphetamine. One study has shown that although the human brain usually has a preference for dextroamphetamine over levoamphetamine, certain children have a better clinical response to levoamphetamine. Amphetamine exists as two stereoisomers that differ in effects. The l- enantiomer (levoamphetamine) produces more cardiovascular and peripheral effects than the d- enantiomer (dextroamphetamine). At low doses, levoamphetamine produces greater arousal than dextroamphetamine, acting primarily on norepinephrine. At higher doses, dextroamphetamine has stimulant properties that are three to four times as potent as those of levoamphetamine, and acts primarily on dopamine, although few clinical studies of ADHD have documented differences among d-, l- and racemic amphetamine. Just as dextroamphetamine has greater central effects and fewer peripheral effects than levoamphetamine, methamphetamine, which is equipotent to dextroamphetamine in producing behavioral stimulant effects, has even fewer peripheral effects and greater central effects than dextroamphetamine. In relation to other over-the-counter ADD/ADHD pharmaceuticals, the d- isomer of racemic amphetamine is superior in bioavailibility and CNS stimulation. Pharmacology. Scientific findings have established that dextroamphetamine administration increases the activity of the phosphoinositol cycle via an indirect release of dopamine and Norepinephrine. These results are the first time that this has been confirmed in humans. Because dextroamphetamine is a substrate analog at monoamine transporters, at all doses, dextroamphetamine prevents the re-uptake of these neurotransmitters by competing with endogenous monoamines for uptake. Transporter inhibition causes monoamines to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (amphetamine inhibits monoamine reuptake in rats with a norepinephrine to dopamine ratio (NE:DA) of 1:1 and a norepinephrine to 5-hydroxytryptamine ratio (NE:5-HT) of about 100:1). At higher doses, when the concentration of dextroamphetamine is sufficient, the drug can trigger direct release of norepinephrine and dopamine from the cytoplasmic transmitter pool, that is, dextroamphetamine will cause norepinephrine and dopamine efflux via transporter proteins, functionally reversing transporter action, which triggers a cascading release of catecholamines. This inversion leads to a release of large amounts of these neurotransmitters from the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron into the synapse, causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors, inducing euphoria. Dextroamphetamine releases monoamines in rats with selectivity ratios of about NE:DA = 1:3.5 and NE:5-HT = 1:250, meaning that NE and DA are readily released, but release of 5-HT occurs at a 1/4 ration than of NE:DA. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex; activation of the dopamine-2 receptors inhibits glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. Activation of the dopamine-1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, however, results in elevated glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens. An increase of the glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens is the reason that dextroamphetamine has an ability to increase locomotor activity in rats. Serotonin also plays a role in dextroamphetamine's effect on glutamate levels; however, at therapeutic doses, dextroamphetamine has minuscule effect on the serotonin transporter (SERT). Pharmacokinetics. On average, about one half of a given dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine, while the other half is broken down into various metabolites (mostly benzoic acid). However, the drug's half-life is highly variable because the rate of excretion is very sensitive to urinary pH. Under alkaline conditions, direct excretion is negligible and 95%+ of the dose is metabolized. Having an alkaline stomach will cause the drug to be absorbed faster through the stomach resulting in a higher blood level concentration of amphetamine. Having an alkaline bladder causes dextroamphetamine to be excreted more slowly from the blood and into the urine. Alkalinization of the urine can decrease the renal elimination of amphetamines, both potentiating the strength and prolonging the mechanism of action, especially when ingested with sodium bicarbonate. The main metabolic pathway is: dextroamphetamine formula_1 phenylacetone formula_1 benzoic acid formula_1 hippuric acid. Another pathway, mediated by enzyme CYP2D6, is: dextroamphetamine formula_1 p-hydroxyamphetamine formula_1 p-hydroxynorephedrine. Although p-hydroxyamphetamine is a minor metabolite (~5% of the dose), it may have significant physiological effects as a norepinephrine analogue. Subjective effects are increased by larger doses, however, over the course of a given dose there is a noticeable divergence between such effects and drug concentration in the blood. In particular, mental effects peak before maximal blood levels are reached, and decline as blood levels remain stable or even continue to increase. This indicates a mechanism for development of acute tolerance, perhaps distinct from that seen in chronic use. The long-term effects of amphetamines use on neural development in children has not been well established. History. Racemic amphetamine was first synthesized under the chemical name ""phenylisopropylamine"" in Berlin, 1887 by the Romanian chemist Lazar Edeleanu. It was not widely marketed until 1932, when the pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French (now known as GlaxoSmithKline) introduced it in the form of the Benzedrine inhaler for use as a bronchodilator. Notably, the amphetamine contained in the Benzedrine inhaler was the liquid free-base, not a chloride or sulfate salt. Three years later, in 1935, the medical community became aware of the stimulant properties of amphetamine, specifically dextroamphetamine, and in 1937 Smith, Kline, and French introduced tablets under the tradename Dexedrine. In the United States, Dexedrine was approved to treat narcolepsy, attention disorders, depression, and obesity. In Canada, epilepsy and parkinsonism were also approved indications. Dextroamphetamine was marketed in various other forms in the following decades, primarily by Smith, Kline, and French, such as several combination medications including a mixture of dextroamphetamine and amobarbital (a barbiturate) sold under the tradename Dexamyl and, in the 1950s, an extended release capsule (the ""Spansule""). It quickly became apparent that dextroamphetamine and other amphetamines had a high potential for misuse, although they were not heavily controlled until 1970, when the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was passed by the United States Congress. Dextroamphetamine, along with other sympathomimetics, was eventually classified as Schedule II, the most restrictive category possible for a drug with a government-sanctioned, recognized medical use. Internationally, it has been available under the names AmfeDyn (Italy), Curban (US), Obetrol (Switzerland), Simpamina (Italy), Dexedrine/GSK (US & Canada), Dexedrine/UCB (United Kingdom), Dextropa (Portugal), and Stild (Spain). In October 2010, GlaxoSmithKline sold the rights for Dexedrine Spansule to Amedra Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of CorePharma). "
wikipedia-471859," Anna's Hummingbird  Anna's Hummingbird (""Calypte anna"") is a medium-sized hummingbird native to the west coast of North America. This bird was named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli. Description. Anna's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3 inches (10 to 11 centimeters) long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and juveniles have a green crown, a grey throat with some red markings, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers. These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects caught in flight. A PBS documentary that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects (at 16:45). They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect. While collecting nectar, they also assist in plant pollination. This species sometimes consumes tree sap. A recent study found that the Anna's hummingbird can shake their bodies 55 times per second while in flight. This shimmy, when done in dry weather, can shake off pollen or dirt from their feathers similar to how a wet shake by a dog removes water. This rate of shaking is the fastest of any vertebrate on earth. Reproduction. Open-wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Arizona make up ""C. anna""'s breeding habitat. The female raises the young without the assistance of the male. The female bird builds a large nest in a shrub or tree, or in vines or on wires. The round, diameter nest is built of very small twigs, lichen and other mosses, and often lined with downy feathers or animal hair. The nest materials are bound together with spider silk or other sticky materials. They are known to nest early as mid-December and as late as June. Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed of 27 m/s, which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels , and produces a loud sound described by some as an ""explosive squeak"" with his outer tail-feathers. Anna's Hummingbirds will sometimes hybridize with other species, but this is not very common. These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species. A bird, allegedly collected in Bolaños, Mexico, was described and named ""Selasphorus floresii"" (Gould, 1861), or Floresi's Hummingbird. Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period, and the species was considered extremely rare. It was later determined that the specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna's Hummingbird and an Allen's Hummingbird. A single bird collected in Santa Barbara, California, was described and named ""Trochilus violajugulum"" (Jeffries, 1888), or Violet-throated Hummingbird. It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna's Hummingbird and a Black-chinned Hummingbird. Distribution. Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern Arizona. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Newfoundland. Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor. There are an estimated 1.5 million Anna's Hummingbirds. Their population appears to be stable, and they are not considered an endangered species. "
wikipedia-471880," Picea abies  Norway spruce (Picea abies) is a species of spruce native to Europe. It is also commonly referred to as the European spruce. Description. It is a large, fast-growing evergreen coniferous tree growing tall and with a trunk diameter of 1 to 1.5m. It can grow fast when young, up to per year for the first 25 years under good conditions, but becomes slower once over tall. The shoots are orange-brown and glabrous (hairless). The leaves are needle-like, 12–24 mm long, quadrangular in cross-section (not flattened), and dark green on all four sides with inconspicuous stomatal lines. The cones are 9–17 cm long (the longest of any spruce), and have bluntly to sharply triangular-pointed scale tips. They are green or reddish, maturing brown 5–7 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 4–5 mm long, with a pale brown 15 mm wing. The tallest measured Norway spruce, 63 m (207 ft) tall, is in Perucica Virgin Forest, Sutjeska National Park, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Variation. Populations in southeast Europe tend to have on average longer cones with more pointed scales; these are sometimes distinguished as ""Picea abies"" var. ""acuminata"" (Beck) Dallim. & A.B.Jacks., but there is extensive overlap in variation with trees from other parts of the range. Some botanists treat Siberian spruce as a subspecies of Norway spruce, though in their typical forms, they are very distinct, the Siberian spruce having cones only 5–10 cm long, with smoothly rounded scales, and pubescent (hairy) shoots. Genetically Norway and Siberian spruces have turned out to be extremely similar and may be considered as two closely related subspecies of ""P. abies"". Another spruce with smoothly rounded cone scales and hairy shoots occurs rarely in the central Alps in eastern Switzerland. It is also distinct in having thicker, blue-green leaves. Many texts treat this as a variant of Norway spruce, but it is as distinct as many other spruces, and appears to be more closely related to Siberian spruce (""Picea obovata""), Schrenk's spruce (""Picea schrenkiana"") from central Asia and Morinda spruce (""Picea smithiana"") in the Himalaya. Treated as a distinct species, it takes the name Alpine spruce (Picea alpestris (Brügger) Stein). As with Siberian spruce, it hybridises extensively with Norway spruce; pure specimens are rare. Hybrids are commonly known as Norwegian spruce, which should not be confused with the pure species Norway spruce. Range. Norway spruce grows throughout Europe from Norway in the northwest and Poland eastward, and also in the mountains of central Europe, southwest to the western end of the Alps, and southeast in the Carpathians and Balkans to the extreme north of Greece. The northern limit is in the arctic, just north of 70°N in Norway. Its eastern limit in Russia is hard to define, due to extensive hybridisation and intergradation with the Siberian spruce, but is usually given as the Ural Mountains. However, trees showing some Siberian spruce characters extend as far west as much of northern Finland, with a few records in northeast Norway. The hybrid is known as ""Picea"" × ""fennica"" (or ""P. abies"" subsp. ""fennica"", if the two taxa are considered subspecies), and can be distinguished by a tendency towards having hairy shoots and cones with smoothly rounded scales. Cultivation. The Norway spruce is one of the most widely planted spruces, both in and outside of its native range, and one of the most economically important coniferous species in Europe. It is used as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It is also widely planted for use as a Christmas tree. Every Christmas, the Norwegian capital city, Oslo, provides the cities of New York, London (the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree), Edinburgh and Washington D.C. with a Norway spruce, which is placed at the most central square of each city. This is mainly a sign of gratitude for the aid these countries gave during the Second World War. In North America, Norway spruce is widely planted, specifically in the northeastern, Pacific Coast, and Rocky Mountain states, as well as in southeastern Canada. It is naturalised in some parts of North America, though not so extensively as to be considered invasive. There are naturalised populations occurring from Connecticut to Michigan, and it is probable that they occur elsewhere. Norway spruces are more tolerant of hot, humid weather than many conifers which do not thrive except in cool-summer areas. The Norway spruce tolerates acidic soils well, but does not do well on dry or deficient soils. From 1928 until the 1960s it was planted on surface mine spoils in Indiana. Cultivars. Several cultivars have been selected for garden use; they are occasionally traded under the obsolete scientific name ""Picea excelsa"" (an illegitimate name). The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: Other uses. It is used in forestry for timber and paper production. The Norway spruce is the source of spruce beer, which was once used to prevent and even cure scurvy. It is esteemed as a source of tonewood. ""Picea abies ""shoot tips have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as syrup or tea) and externally (as baths, for inhalation, as ointments, as resin application or as tea) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, skin, locomotor system, gastrointestinal tract and infections. Ecology. Norway spruce cone scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth ""Cydia illutana"", while ""C. duplicana"" feeds on the bark around injuries or canker. Genetics. The Norway spruce genome was sequenced in 2013, the first gymnosperm genome to be completely sequenced. The genome contains approximately 20billion base pairs and is about six times the size of the human genome, despite possessing a similar number of genes. A large proportion of the spruce genome consists of repetitive DNA sequences, including long terminal repeat transposable elements. Despite recent advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing, the assembly of such a large and repetitive genome is a particularly challenging task, mainly from a computational perspective. World's ""oldest clone"". A press release from Umeå University says that a Norway spruce clone named Old Tjikko, carbon dated as 9,550 years old, is the ""oldest living tree"". However, Pando, a stand of 47,000 Quaking Aspen clones, is estimated to be between 80,000 and one million years old. The stress is on the difference between the singular ""oldest tree"" and the multiple ""oldest trees"", and between ""oldest clone"" and ""oldest non-clone"". The oldest known individual tree (that has not taken advantage of vegetative cloning) is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine over 5,000 years old (germination in 3051 BC). Chemistry. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid glucoside, picein, piceatannol and its glucoside (astringin), isorhapontin (the isorhapontigenin glucoside), catechin and ferulic acid are phenolic compounds found in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of Norway spruces. Piceol and astringin are also found in ""P. abies"". "
wikipedia-471887," Spotted Nutcracker  The Spotted Nutcracker, Eurasian Nutcracker, or just Nutcracker, (""Nucifraga caryocatactes"") is a passerine bird slightly larger than the Eurasian Jay. It has a much larger bill and a slimmer looking head without any crest. The feathering over its body is predominantly a chocolate brown with distinct white spots and streaks. The wings and upper tail are virtually black with a greenish-blue gloss. It is one of three species of nutcracker. The Large-spotted Nutcracker (""Nucifraga multipunctata""), was formerly considered a subspecies. The other, Clark's Nutcracker (""Nucifraga columbiana""), occurs in western North America. Taxonomy. The Nutcracker was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, ""Systema Naturae"", and it still bears its original name of ""Nucifraga caryocatactes"". The scientific name is a reduplication, with ""Nucifraga"" based on Latin: ""nucis"" nut + ""frangere"" to shatter, and ""caryocatactes"" based on Greek: ""karuon"" nut + ""kataseio"" to shatter. The common English name ""nutcracker"" first appears in 1738 in a translation of a German travel guide, where it is a calque on the German name ""Nußknacker"", as the bird was not recorded in England until 1753. Other Germanic languages have etymologically related names: Danish: ""Nøddekrige""; Dutch: ""Notenkraker""; Norwegian: ""Nøttekråke""; Swedish: ""Nötkråka"". Subspecies. There are nine recognised subspecies Description. The Spotted Nutcracker is a dark brown, broad-winged, short-tailed corvid. Body plumage is mid to dark chocolate brown, heavily spotted with white on face, neck, mantle and underparts. It has a large white loral spot, a white eye-ring, blackish brown cap extending onto the nape, dark blackish wings with a greenish-blue gloss, all white vent, and dark tail with white corners above and a white terminal band on the undertail. In flight, broad wings, white vent and short tail are noticeable; the flight undulating. The black bill is slender and rather long, sharply pointed, and varies in size amongst races. The iris, legs and feet are black. Nutcrackers range from 32–38 cm in length (from tip of beak to tip of tail) and have a wingspan ranging from 49–53 cm. The voice is similar to that of the Eurasian Jay and is loud and harsh. It is described as ""kraak-kraak-kraak-kraak"". Behaviour. Feeding. The most important food resources for this species are the seeds (pine nuts) of various Pines (""Pinus"" sp.), principally the cold-climate (far northern and high altitude) species of white pine (""Pinus"" subgenus ""Strobus"") with large seeds: ""P. armandii, P. cembra, P. koraiensis, P. parviflora, P. peuce, P. pumila, P. sibirica"" and ""P. wallichiana"", and also the two lacebark pines in subgenus ""Ducampopinus, P. bungeana"" and ""P. gerardiana"". In some regions, where none of these pines occur, the seeds of Spruce (""Picea"" sp.) and Hazel nuts (""Corylus"" sp.) form an important part of the diet too. The forms that take Hazel nuts have thicker bills for cracking their hard shells, with a special ridge on the inside of the bill edge near the base. If the shell is too hard, it holds the nut between its feet and hacks at it with its bill like a chisel. Surplus seed is always stored for later use and it is this species that is responsible for the sowing of new trees of their favoured pines, including the re-establishment of the Swiss Pine (""Pinus cembra"") over large areas in the Alps of central Europe formerly cleared by man. Various insects are also taken, and also small birds, their eggs and nestlings, small rodents and carrion such as roadkills. It digs out bumble bee and wasp nests avidly to get at the grubs. Breeding. Nutcracker couples stay together for life and their territory expands between 20 and 30 acres. Nesting is always early in this species across its whole range, so as to make the best use of pine nuts stored the previous autumn. The nest is usually built high in a conifer (sometimes broadleaved trees are used) and usually on the sunny side. There are normally 2-4 eggs laid and incubated for 18 days. Both sexes feed the young which are usually fledged by about 23 days and stay with their parents for many months, following them to learn the food storage techniques essential for survival in their harsh environment. Distribution. The Spotted Nutcracker has an extensive range forming a broad swathe east-west from Scandinavia right across northern Europe, Siberia and to eastern Asia, including Japan, inhabiting the huge taiga conifer forests in the north. Three further disjunct populations occur in mountain conifer forests further south, one centered on the mountains of central and southeast Europe (the Alps, the Carpathians and the Balkan Peninsula mountains); another in the western Himalaya; and the third in western China seaboard and separated from the northern population by a relatively small gap in the north centre of China. See subspecies list above for race distributions. Some of the populations can be separated on bill size. This species has a large range, extending over 10,000,000 km² globally. It also has a large global population, with an estimate of between 800,000-1,700,000 individuals in Europe. Spotted Nutcrackers are not migratory, but will erupt out of range when a cone crop failure leaves them short of a food supply, the thin-billed eastern race ""macrorhynchos"" being the more likely to do this. Britain records about 8 vagrants per year, but in 1968 over 300 Nutcrackers visited Britain as part of a larger irruption into western Europe, probably due to a spell of early cold weather in Siberia.

wikipedia-471904," Panama hat  A Panama hat (toquilla straw hat) is a traditional brimmed straw hat of Ecuadorian origin. Traditionally, hats were made from the plaited leaves of the ""Carludovica palmata"" plant, known locally as the ""toquilla palm"" or ""jipijapa palm"", although it is a palm-like plant rather than a true palm. Panama hats are light-colored, lightweight, and breathable, and often worn as accessories to summer-weight suits, such as those made of linen or silk. Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, panamas began to be associated with the seaside and tropical locales. The art of weaving was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists on 6 December 2012. History. The hat known today as the Panama hat was produced in Ecuador as early as the seventeenth century. Straw hats woven in Ecuador, like many other 19th and early 20th century South American goods, were shipped first to the Isthmus of Panama before sailing for their destinations in Asia, the rest of the Americas and Europe, subsequently acquiring a name that reflected their point of international sale, ""Panama hats"", rather than their place of domestic origin. The term was being used by at least 1834. The popularity of the hats was increased in the mid-nineteenth century by the miners of the California Gold Rush, who frequently traveled to California via the Isthmus of Panama. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt of the United States visited the construction site of the Panama Canal, and was photographed wearing a Panama hat, which further increased the hats' popularity. The hats were later worn by many early-twentieth century film stars during films. The Ecuadorian national hero and emblematic figure Eloy Alfaro helped finance his liberal revolution of Ecuador in the late nineteenth century through the export of Panama hats. Tamsui hat. The tamsui hat was a straw hat made in Formosa (now Taiwan) to directly compete with the Panama in the early twentieth century. Tamsui hats were made from ""Pandanus odorattssimus"" fibre, which grew plentifully on the island. As they retained their whiteness, were washable, and could be folded and carried about without damage, Tamsui hats replaced the rather costlier Panama in the far East in the early twentieth century. Quality. The two main processes in the creation of a Panama hat are weaving and blocking. Hats are commercially graded with numeric degrees to indicate quality, but these vary by seller. The rarest and most expensive hats can have as many as 1600–2500 weaves per square inch. These hats are known as ""Montecristis"", after the town of Montecristi, where they are produced. The Montecristi Foundation has established a grading system based on a figure called the Montecristi Cuenta, calculated by measuring the horizontal and vertical rows of weave per inch. A ""superfino"" Panama hat can hold water, and when rolled for storage, can pass through a wedding ring. Although the Panama hat continues to provide a livelihood for thousands of Ecuadorians, fewer than a dozen weavers capable of making the finest ""Montecristi superfinos"" remain. Production in Ecuador is dwindling, due to economic problems in Ecuador and competition from Chinese hat producers. "
wikipedia-471914," Surinamese dollar  The dollar (ISO 4217 code ""SRD"") has been the currency of Suriname since 2004. It is divided into 100 cents. History. The dollar replaced the Surinamese guilder on 1 January 2004, with one dollar equal to 1000 guilders. Initially, only coins were available, with banknotes delayed until mid-February, reportedly due to a problem at the printer, the Bank of Canada. The old coins denominated in cent (i.e., 1/100 guilder) were declared to be worth their face value in the new cents, negating the necessity of producing new coins. Thus, for example, an old 25 cent coin, previously worth quarter of a guilder, was now worth quarter of a dollar. Amendment 121 of ISO 4217 gave the currency the code SRD replacing the Suriname guilder (SRG). The people of Suriname often refer to their currency as SRD to differentiate it from the US dollar, which is also used to quote prices for electronic goods, household furnishings and appliances, and automobiles. In January 2011, the USD was made to be worth 3,25 SRD. Coins. Coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 100 and 250 cents from the previous currency are in circulation. Banknotes. The Surinamese dollar replaced the Surinamese guilder on 1 January 2004, with one dollar equal to 1,000 guilders, prompting the issuance of notes denominated in the new currency. On the notes, the currency is expressed in the singular, as is the Dutch custom. "
wikipedia-471933," Teddy Wilson  Theodore Shaw ""Teddy"" Wilson (November 24, 1912 – July 31, 1986) was an American jazz pianist. Described by critic Scott Yanow as ""the definitive swing pianist"", Wilson's sophisticated and elegant style was featured on the records of many of the biggest names in jazz including Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. With Goodman, he was one of the first black musicians to appear prominently with white musicians. In addition to his extensive work as a sideman, Wilson also led his own groups and recording sessions from the late 1920s to the 1980s. Biography. Wilson was born in Austin, Texas, on November 24, 1912. He studied piano and violin at Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. After working in Speed Webb's band, with Louis Armstrong, and also understudying Earl Hines in Hines's Grand Terrace Cafe Orchestra, Wilson joined Benny Carter's Chocolate Dandies in 1933. In 1935, he joined the Benny Goodman Trio (which consisted of Goodman, Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa, later expanded to the Benny Goodman Quartet with the addition of Lionel Hampton). The trio performed during the big band's intermissions. By joining the trio, Wilson became one of the first black musicians to perform prominently in a racially integrated group. Noted jazz producer and writer John Hammond was instrumental in getting Wilson a contract with Brunswick, starting in 1935, to record hot swing arrangements of the popular songs of the day, with the growing jukebox trade in mind. He recorded fifty hit records with various singers such as Lena Horne, Helen Ward and Billie Holiday, including many of Holiday's greatest successes. During these years, he also took part in many highly regarded sessions with a wide range of important swing musicians such as Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers, Red Norvo, Buck Clayton, and Ben Webster. Wilson formed his own short-lived big band in 1939, then led a sextet at Café Society from 1940 to 1944. He was dubbed the ""Marxist Mozart"" by Howard ""Stretch"" Johnson due to his support for left-wing causes: he performed in benefit concerts for ""The New Masses"" journal and for Russian War Relief, and he chaired the Artists' Committee to elect Benjamin J. Davis. In the 1950s, Wilson taught at the Juilliard School. Wilson can be seen appearing as himself in the 1955 motion picture ""The Benny Goodman Story"". He also worked as music director for the ""Dick Cavett Show"". Wilson lived quietly in suburban Hillsdale, New Jersey, in the 1960s and 1970s. He performed as a soloist and with pick-up groups until the final years of his life, including leading a trio with his sons Theodore Wilson on bass and Steven Wilson on drums.  Wilson died in New Britain, Connecticut, on July 31, 1986; he was 73. He is buried at Fairview Cemetery in New Britain. In addition to Theodore and Steven, Wilson had three more children, William, James (Jim) and Dune. Select discography. As sideman: "
wikipedia-471937," Scandinavian folklore  Scandinavian folklore is the folklore of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Finland. Collecting folklore began when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden sent out instructions to all of the priests in all of the parishes to collect the folklore of their area in the 1630s. They collected customs, beliefs that were not sanctioned by the church, and other traditional material. In Scandinavia, the term 'folklore' is not often used in academic circles; instead terms such as ""Folketro"" (folk belief; older Almuetro) or ""Folkesagn"" (folktales) have been coined. In common speech, it is simply referred to as ""den Gamle Tro"" (the old belief), or perhaps ""sæd skik og brug"" (customs, the way). It evolved from Norse paganism, and it is in technical terms labelled low-mythology, while the norse mythology is called high-mythology. High-mythology builds on low-mythology in its parts. Iceland and the Faroe Islands are not a part of Scandinavia (although they are Nordic countries), but should nevertheless be regarded as Scandinavian in folkloric terms. Because of their common Germanic origin, Scandinavian folklore shows a large correspondence with folklores elsewhere, such as England and Germany, among others. Most of what has survived there might be found, of a similar nature, in the Baltic countries. Gods and goddesses. In Scandinavian folklore, belief in the old gods still exists, but not in the form they show in high mythology. Some of the ones known in both forms of mythology are Odin (""Odin""), who is said to lead the Wild Hunt; Thor (""Tor"") who still chases trolls with his thunder, both in this context regarded as ""jegere"" (hunters), and we see also Ull (as Ul) and Hœnir in this role. Loki (Loke), as a housegod of the house fire, and sometimes Freyja, show up. Beings of Scandinavian folklore. The best way to gain an understanding of Scandinavian folklore is to examine the creatures of the tales. A large number of different mythological creatures (or rather ""races"", since few of them can be considered animals) from Norse mythology continue to live on, surprisingly little affected by Christian beliefs, even though the wicked ones at times find an ally in the Devil or had problems with Christian symbols. Nothing was surer, though, to scare these beings than a piece of iron or steel, such as a strategically placed pair of scissors or a knife, or with salt and fire. The stories about the livings and doings of these beings, and their interaction with humans, constitute the major part of Scandinavian folklore. Even the helpful tomte, nisse, gårdbo or gårdbuk could turn into a fearsome adversary if not treated with caution and respect. Many of them blend into each other when their morals and/or place of residence are similar, and equally when one moves from one region in Scandinavia to another (the same is true for Norse mythology). When the folktales were collected and printed, the illustrators started to give shape to the creatures that had hitherto lingered in obscurity. The creatures underwent a metamorphosis and became concrete figures to the people of Scandinavian countries. Trolls. Perhaps most abundant are the stories about the race of trolls(Danish: trolde, Swedish/norwegian:troll). Scandinavian trolls tend to be very big, hairy, stupid, and slow to act. Any human with courage and presence of mind can outwit a troll, and those whose faith is strong can even challenge them to mortal combat. They are said to have a temperament like a bear- which are, incidentally, their favorite pets- good-natured when they are left in peace, and savage when they are teased. Trolls come in many different shapes and forms, and are generally not fair to behold, as they can have as many as nine heads. Trolls live throughout the land, dwelling in mountains, under bridges, and at the bottom of lakes. While the trolls who live in the mountains are very wealthy, hoarding mounds of gold and silver in their cliff dwellings, the most dangerous trolls live in lonely huts in the forest. While few trolls have female trolls, trollkoner, as wives, most possesses a regrettable tendency to spirit away beautiful maidens, preferably princesses, who are forced to spin by day and scratch the troll’s head by night. The trolls have their own king, called Dovregubben, who lives inside the Dovre Mountains with his court. Dovregubben and his court are described in detail in Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt.” After the integration of Christianity into Scandinavian folklore, trolls developed a hatred of church-bells and the smell of Christians. Trolls are often said to be able to change their appearance and did so in order to trick humans into doing what they wanted. For example, Trolls may present a beautiful appearance in order to trick a character into following them into their mountain home, then hold the character captive for years (bergatagen) - see the similarities with Irish ""elven/fiery hills."" In older tales, the word troll/trold (trolla as a verb) may simply mean ""to badly harm/hurt someone""; someone who is a troll is someone who may eat human flesh or engage in other socially-unacceptable acts, such as rape. Luckily, trolls are said to turn into stone when exposed to sunlight. Female creatures. The Huldra, Hylda, Skogsrå or Skogfru (Forest wife/woman) is a dangerous Seductress who lives in the forest. The Huldra lures men into the forest in order to secure her freedom or sometimes to suck the life out of a man. One of her methods is to appear suddenly out of the rain and mist, friendly and enticing to the point that no man can resist her charm. She has a long cow’s tail that she ties under her skirt in order to hide it from men. If she can manage to get married in a church, her tail falls off and she becomes human. However, she also becomes very ugly. It is often said, however, that the young and beautiful Huldra is moody and dangerous, but when she becomes old and ugly, she also becomes gentle and caring to the man who made her Christian. She has an aquatic counterpart called ""havsfrun"" or ""Havsrå"" (Sea wife/woman) who is very similar to the Sirens Odysseus meets in the Odyssey. In Scandinavia there existed the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras. If a female at midnight stretches between four sticks the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras. Women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge monster half human and half wolf. The transformation was slow and subjects suffered from screaming, hair and nail growth and the woman's face stretched into that of a hungry wolf. In fact, the Maras were almost all women from peasant and plebeian classes. Mermaids in most mythology have a bad reputation of luring men to their watery demise. In Scandinavian folklore, they are good-natured beings who sit on rocks and comb their beautiful gold hair. Quite unlike their wicked sister, Lorelei, who does lure men to their death, mermaids warn seafaring men of storms and other dangers. They can foretell the future, and because of this, there is often an air of melancholy around them. Witches in Scandinavian folklore in particular are recognized by their long noses and cats, just as in other lands. There are at least three species of witch in this branch of folklore. Other creatures. Water creatures. The Fossegrimen is a spirit who lives in waterfalls and is neither good nor evil. The ""Fossegrimen"" is a magnificent musician who plays the fiddle day and night. If an aspiring fiddle player ventures to seek his help, the ""Fossegrimen"" will gladly help, for a price of course. He must go to the waterfall and offer the ""Fossegrimen"" a nice meal, usually a good plump joint of meat. Many stories tell of travelers who have tried to palm the ""Fossegrimen"" off with an inadequate piece of meat, resulting in the ""Fossegrimen"" just teaching the student how to tune his fiddle rather than play it. He is said to be young and handsome though never leaves his waterfall. Nøkken, ""näcken"", or ""strömkarlen"", is a fresh water dwelling relative of the ""Fossegrimen"", but unlike his kinsman, the ""nøkken"" is both dangerous and clever. The ""nøkken"" plays a violin to lure his victims out onto thin ice or in leaky boats and then draws them down to the bottom of the water where he is waiting for them. The ""nøkken"" is also a known shapeshifter, usually changing into a horse or a man in order to lure his victims to him. In the depths of the Baltic Sea, lives the draug or the ""Strandvaskare"". The draug is the spirit of a person who died at sea. He sails through the sea in half a boat. If a man happens to see a draug, he is in mortal danger unless he races the draug and wins. The word ""Strandvaskere"" is found in Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. It refers to a drowned person washing up on the shore. Water spirits, among others the nix, are often presented in the shape of a devil. A water spirit would hide in the rapids and lure people into the water to drown. He was also believed to be able to transform into a predatory kelpie (""bäckahäst"" or ""bækhest""). In Scandinavian folklore, dragons are commonly known as ""lindworms"", monstrous serpents with or without hind legs. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, they typically live in the ocean, and here, tales of marine monsters appear to have the widest dissemination, although a famous specimen is also said to reside in the Swedish lake ""Storsjön"". The Norwegian lake ""Seljordsvatn"" is also famous for its claimed inhabitant, a serpent known as ""Selma"". The coasts of Scandinavia are reportedly also haunted by the terrifying ""Kraken"". Sea serpents, with their glowing eyes and long manes, are also prevalent in Scandinavian folklore, as well as their invisible kin the sea-whip. Invisible creatures. Some say that the ""dwarves"" of Scandinavian folklore lived on as wights (""vättar"" or ""huldrefolk""), although with somewhat different characteristics. Wights live underground, often right next to human settlements, and are commonly a menace to their ground-dwelling neighbors. A type of wight from Northern Sweden called ""Vittra"" lives underground, is invisible most of the time and has its own cattle. Most of the time Vittra are rather distant and do not meddle in human affairs, but are fearsome when enraged. This can be achieved by not respecting them properly, for example by neglecting to perform certain rituals (such as saying ""look out"" when putting out hot water or going to the toilet so they can move out of the way) or building your home to close to or, even worse, on top of their home, disturbing their cattle or blocking their roads. They can make your life very very miserable or even dangerous - they do whatever it takes to drive you away, even arrange accidents that will harm or even kill you. Even in modern days, people have rebuilt or moved houses in order not to block a ""Vittra-way"", or moved from houses that are deemed a ""Vittra-place"" (Vittra ställe) because of bad luck - although this is rather uncommon. In tales told in the north of Sweden, Vittra often take the place that trolls, tomte and vättar hold in the same stories told in other parts of the country. Vittra are believed to sometimes ""borrow"" cattle that later would be returned to the owner with the ability to give more milk as a sign of gratitude. This tradition is heavily influenced by the fact that it was developed during a time when people let their cattle graze on mountains or in the forest for long periods of the year. The ""tomte"" or ""nisse"" (in the southern Sweden and Norway and Denmark) is a good wight who takes care of the house and barn when the farmer is asleep, but only if the farmer reciprocates by setting out food for the ""Tomte"" and he himself also takes care of his family, farm and animals. If the ""Tomte"" is ignored or maltreated or the farm is not cared for, he can sabotage a lot of the work on the farm to teach the farmer a lesson or two. Although the ""Tomte"" should be treated with respect and some degree of kindness he should not be treated too kindly. In fact, there's a Swedish story in which a farmer and his wife enters their barn an early morning and finds the little grey old man brushing the floor. They see his clothing, which is nothing more than torn rags, so the wife decides to make him some new clothes but when the ""Tomte"" finds them in the barn he now thinks he is too elegant to perform any more farm labour and thus disappears from the farm. In Swedish, the word ""Tomten"" (the Tomte in singular) is very closely linked to the word for the plot of land where a house or cottage is built, which spells the same both in singular and plural (Tomten/tomterna) but is pronounced with slightly longer vocals. Therefore some scholars believe that the wight ""Tomten"" originates from some sort of general house god or deity from before the ""Asa"" belief. A Nisse/Tomte is said to be able to change his size between that of a 5-year-old child and a thumb, and also to have the ability to make himself invisible. Land creatures. The race of dwarves (or Svartálfar/dark/black elves as opposite of the ""light elves"" ""ljusalfer"") were not short in the beginning, lived underground, had dark hair and gray or pale skin, and were not very fond of the sun. They were master smiths with good knowledge in various kinds of magic and rather greedy folk - in short, not very pleasant to do business with. Some scholars believe that they may have originated from some kind of Indo-European worship of dead spirits (maybe ancestors) with great knowledge - thus their original physical appearance. Over time, they grew short and less and less ""ghoulish"" and evolved into the dwarves whom we see in Snorres Edda and later tales. The actual Dwarven size is believed by some to have originated from German tales which were in their turn influenced by Roman stories of child slave labor in mines - but this cannot be proven. Elves (in Swedish called ""Älva"" if female and ""Alf"" if male) are in some parts mostly described as female (in contrast to the light and dark elves in the Edda), otherworldly beautiful and seductive residents of forests, meadows and mires. They are skilled in magic and illusions. Sometimes they are described as small fairies, sometimes as full-sized women and sometimes as half transparent spirits - or a mix thereof. They are closely linked to the mist and it is often said in Sweden that ""the Elves are dancing in the mist"". The female form of Elves may have originated from the female deities called ""Dís"" (singular) and ""Díser"" (plural) found in pre-Christian Scandinavian religion. They were very powerful spirits closely linked to the ""seid"" magic. Even today the word ""dis"" is a synonym for mist or very light rain in both Swedish and Danish. Particularly in Denmark, the female elves have merged with the dangerous and seductive ""huldra"", ""skogsfrun"" or ""keeper of the forest"", often called hylde. In some parts of Sweden the elves also got some features from ""Skogsfrun""/""Huldra""/""Hylda"" and can seduce and bewitch careless men and suck the life out of them or make them go down in the mire and drown. But at the same time the ""Skogsrå"" exists as its own being with other distinct features clearly separate from the elves. In more modern tales it isn't uncommon for a rather ugly male Tomte, Troll, Vätte or a Dwarf to fall in love with a beautiful Elven female - as beginning of a story of impossible or forbidden love. Ellepiger (alder tree girls) are the most famous of the Ellefolket (the alder tree people) in Danish folklore. The girls dance around at night - luring many a young man to join them and to never be heard of again. They are beautiful but their backs are hollow. One of the most notable, and evil, creatures from folklore is the Devil himself, called ""Fanden"" in Scandinavian folklore. He is depicted with horns, a goatee, and a hoof instead of a left foot. He is also tall and lean and wears a top-hat. The Norwegian devil has no wife, but his great-grandmother keeps house for him. While he tends to be very cunning, it is hard for him to outwit a human, as he his extremely gullible and prideful. For example, in one story, the human escapes after betting the devil he cannot fit inside an empty nutshell (which the devil does just to prove he can). Many of the terms in Nordic beliefs are used for different kinds of creatures, and to really know what is meant, one usually needs to put them into context. That characteristics are sometimes flowing into each other doesn't make it easier. Vætter (evil little creatures), ""Underjordiske""(the hidden ones/they below ground) and ""småfolk"" (little people) can be used loosely as terms for nearly all of the small beings in the old beliefs. The ""myling"" is the ghost of a child left to die in the wilderness, and the ""mara"" is a wraith said to cause nightmares and sleep paralysis. Stories also tell of the will o' the wisp (""irrbloss"", ""lyktgubbar"" or ""lygtemænd""), often assumed to be the spirits of people who had drowned in lakes and marshes. According to some stories, they could lead a lost wanderer to a death similar to their own; according to others, they could lead him home. These are only a few of the mythical creatures, and only shortly explained. Effect of Christianity on folklore. The Christianization of Scandinavia completed by the 11th century meant that the high-mythology more or less phased out of use. This process may have been quite rapid because these never were the beliefs of the lower classes. While mythology was phased out, the gods, heroes and stories are brought to life through folklore. Folklore was a key instrument in integrating Christianity into Scandinavian society, and legends once focused on the pagan religion picked up Christian aspects. After Christian beliefs and traditions were introduced into society, there was a noticeable change in the characteristics of some of the creatures. For example, the horrid and evil trolls of the mountains developed a fear of church-bells, and the ""huldre"" preyed on good Christian men. The “evil” creatures of folklore began to fight the heroes and great kings over Christian symbols, such in the tale of King Olav Haraldsson and the trolls, with the Christians always appearing to prevail. Folklore also started to develop morals about being good Christian citizens. For example, only the strong of faith could defeat the ""draugr"". Scandinavian folklore in popular media. The creatures, symbols, and themes of Scandinavian folklore can be seen readily in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series by J.R.R Tolkien. For example, the ""one ring"" comes from folklore, such as the famous legend, ""The Volsunga Saga"". In this story, a magic ring owned by a dwarf named Andvari is stolen. When Loki, the god of Fire, steals the ring, Andvari shouts ""I curse you for this! The ring will carry my curse forever. All who possesses the ring will be destroyed!"" This only leads to death and destruction, and later Fafnir morphs into a serpent of sorts, whose outer body matches his inner evil created by the ring. This theme seems to carry over into the story behind the character Gollum. Also, there is a parallel between the Nordic legend of ""Frotha-Firth"" who stood as a peacemaker, and Frodo, the seeker of peace. Other symbols of Scandinavian folklore can be seen in the Swedish film Marianne. At the heart of this film is a Mare that sits on the chest of victims, suffocating them. The manga series ""Oh My Goddess!"" by Kōsuke Fujishima contains many elements of Scandinavian folklore, most notably the three leading female characters, who are named after the Norns, and many Scandinavian creatures are present to an extent, such as Sleipnir, Fenrir, and Garmr. In 2010, the French composer Kentin Jivek releases an album called ""Ode to Marmæle"" inspired by the myth of the same name and Norwegian folklore. "
